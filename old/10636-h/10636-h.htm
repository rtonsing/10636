  <h3 class="xlarge" id="NOTE_BY_MISS_YULE">NOTE BY MISS YULE.</h3>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I desire</span> to take this opportunity of recording my grateful sense of the
    unsparing labour, learning, and devotion, with which my father’s valued
    friend, Professor Henri Cordier, has performed the difficult and delicate
    task which I entrusted to his loyal friendship.</p>

  <p>Apart from Professor Cordier’s very special qualifications for the work, I
    feel sure that no other Editor could have been more entirely acceptable to
    my father. I can give him no higher praise than to say that he has laboured
    in Yule’s own spirit.</p>

  <p>The slight Memoir which I have contributed (for which I accept all
    responsibility), attempts no more than a rough sketch of my father’s
    character and career, but it will, I hope, serve to recall pleasantly
    his remarkable individuality to the few remaining who knew him in his
    prime, whilst it may also afford some idea of the man, and his work and
    environment, to those who had not that advantage.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span></p>

  <p>No one can be more conscious than myself of its many shortcomings, which I
    will not attempt to excuse. I can, however, honestly say that these have
    not been due to negligence, but are rather the blemishes almost inseparable
    from the fulfilment under the gloom of bereavement and amidst the pressure
    of other duties, of a task undertaken in more favourable circumstances.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, in spite of all defects, I believe this sketch to be such a
    record as my father would himself have approved, and I know also that he
    would have chosen my hand to write it.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I may note that the first edition of this work was dedicated
    to that very noble lady, the Queen (then Crown Princess) Margherita of
    Italy. In the second edition the Dedication was reproduced within brackets
    (as also the original preface), but not renewed. That precedent is again
    followed.</p>

  <p>I have, therefore, felt at liberty to associate the present edition of my
    father’s work with the Name <span class="smcap">Murchison</span>, which for more than a generation was
    the name most generally representative of British Science in Foreign Lands,
    as of Foreign Science in Britain.</p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <img class="illow100" src="images/diamondbar.png" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Little</span> did I think, some thirty years ago, when I received a copy of the
    first edition of this grand work, that I should be one day entrusted with
    the difficult but glorious task of supervising the third edition. When
    the first edition of the <cite>Book of Ser Marco Polo</cite> reached “Far Cathay,”
    it created quite a stir in the small circle of the learned foreigners,
    who then resided there, and became a starting-point for many researches,
    of which the results have been made use of partly in the second edition,
    and partly in the present. The Archimandrite <span class="smcap">Palladius</span> and Dr. E.
    <span class="smcap">Bretschneider</span>, at Peking, <span class="smcap">Alex. Wylie</span>, at Shang-hai—friends of mine who
    have, alas! passed away, with the exception of the Right Rev. Bishop G. E.
    <span class="smcap">Moule</span>, of Hang-chau, the only survivor of this little group of hard-working
    scholars,—were the first to explore the Chinese sources of information
    which were to yield a rich harvest into their hands.</p>

  <p>When I returned home from China in 1876, I was introduced to Colonel
    <span class="smcap">Henry Yule</span>, at the India Office, by our common friend, Dr. <span class="smcap">Reinhold Rost</span>,
    and from that time we met frequently and kept up a correspondence which
    terminated only with the life of the great geographer, whose friend I
    had become. A new edition of the travels of Friar Odoric of Pordenone,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>our “mutual friend,” in which Yule had taken the greatest interest, was
    dedicated by me to his memory. I knew that Yule contemplated a third
    edition of his <cite>Marco Polo</cite>, and all will regret that time was not allowed
    to him to complete this labour of love, to see it published. If the duty
    of bringing out the new edition of <cite>Marco Polo</cite> has fallen on one who
    considers himself but an unworthy successor of the first illustrious
    commentator, it is fair to add that the work could not have been entrusted
    to a more respectful disciple. Many of our tastes were similar; we had the
    same desire to seek the truth, the same earnest wish to be exact, perhaps
    the same sense of humour, and, what is necessary when writing on Marco
    Polo, certainly the same love for Venice and its history. Not only am I,
    with the late <span class="smcap">Charles Schefer</span>, the founder and the editor of the <cite lang="fr">Recueil
    de Voyages et de Documents pour servir à l’Histoire de la Géographie depuis
    le XIII<sup>e</sup> jusqu’à la fin du XVI<sup>e</sup> siècle</cite>, but I am also the successor, at
    the École des langues Orientales Vivantes, of G. <span class="smcap">Pauthier</span>, whose book on
    the Venetian Traveller is still valuable, so the mantle of the last two
    editors fell upon my shoulders.</p>

  <p>I therefore, gladly and thankfully, accepted Miss <span class="smcap">Amy Francis Yule’s</span> kind
    proposal to undertake the editorship of the third edition of the <cite>Book of
    Ser Marco Polo</cite>, and I wish to express here my gratitude to her for the
    great honour she has thus done me.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>Unfortunately for his successor, Sir Henry Yule, evidently trusting to his
    own good memory, left but few notes. These are contained in an interleaved
    copy obligingly placed at my disposal by Miss Yule, but I luckily found
    assistance from various other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>quarters. The following works have proved of
    the greatest assistance to me:—The articles of General <span class="smcap">Houtum-Schindler</span> in
    the <cite>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</cite>, and the excellent books of Lord
    <span class="smcap">Curzon</span> and of Major P. <span class="smcap">Molesworth Sykes</span> on Persia, M. <span class="smcap">Grenard’s</span> account of
    <span class="smcap">Dutreuil</span> de <span class="smcap">Rhins’</span> Mission to Central Asia, <span class="smcap">Bretschneider’s</span> and <span class="smcap">Palladius’</span>
    remarkable papers on Mediæval Travellers and Geography, and above all, the
    valuable books of the Hon. W. W. <span class="smcap">Rockhill</span> on Tibet and Rubruck, to which
    the distinguished diplomatist, traveller, and scholar kindly added a list
    of notes of the greatest importance to me, for which I offer him my hearty thanks.</p>

  <p>My thanks are also due to H.H. Prince <span class="smcap">Roland Bonaparte</span>, who kindly gave me
    permission to reproduce some of the plates of his <cite>Recueil de Documents de
    l’Époque Mongole</cite>, to M. <span class="smcap">Léopold Delisle</span>, the learned Principal Librarian
    of the Bibliothèque Nationale, who gave me the opportunity to study the
    inventory made after the death of the Doge Marino Faliero, to the Count
    de <span class="smcap">Semallé</span>, formerly French Chargé d’Affaires at Peking, who gave me for
    reproduction a number of photographs from his valuable personal collection,
    and last, not least, my old friend Comm. <span class="smcap">Nicolò Barozzi</span>, who continued to
    lend me the assistance which he had formerly rendered to Sir Henry Yule at Venice.</p>

  <p>Since the last edition was published, more than twenty-five years ago,
    Persia has been more thoroughly studied; new routes have been explored
    in Central Asia, Karakorum has been fully described, and Western and
    South-Western China have been opened up to our knowledge in many
    directions. The results of these investigations form the main features of
    this new edition of <cite>Marco Polo</cite>. I have suppressed hardly any of Sir <span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>Henry
    Yule’s notes and altered but few, doing so only when the light of recent
    information has proved him to be in error, but I have supplemented them by
    what, I hope, will be found useful, new information.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <p>Before I take leave of the kind reader, I wish to thank sincerely Mr. <span class="smcap">John
    Murray</span> for the courtesy and the care he has displayed while this edition
    was going through the press.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> unexpected amount of favour bestowed on the former edition of this Work
    has been a great encouragement to the Editor in preparing this second one.</p>

  <p>Not a few of the kind friends and correspondents who lent their aid
    before have continued it to the present revision. The contributions of
    Mr. A. <span class="smcap">Wylie</span> of Shang-hai, whether as regards the amount of labour which
    they must have cost him, or the value of the result, demand above all
    others a grateful record here. Nor can I omit to name again with hearty
    acknowledgment Signor Comm. G. <span class="smcap">Berchet</span> of Venice, the Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Caldwell</span>,
    Colonel (now Major-General) R. <span class="smcap">Maclagan</span>, R.E., Mr. D. <span class="smcap">Hanbury</span>, F.R.S., Mr.
    <span class="smcap">Edward Thomas</span>, F.R.S. (Corresponding Member of the Institute), and Mr. R.
    H. <span class="smcap">Major</span>.</p>

  <p>But besides these old names, not a few new ones claim my thanks.</p>

  <p>The Baron F. <span class="smcap">von Richthofen</span>, now President of the Geographical Society of
    Berlin, a traveller who not only has trodden many hundreds of miles in
    the footsteps of our Marco, but has perhaps travelled over more of the
    Interior of China than Marco ever did, and who carried to that survey
    high scientific accomplishments <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>of which the Venetian had not even a
    rudimentary conception, has spontaneously opened his bountiful stores
    of new knowledge in my behalf. Mr. <span class="smcap">Ney Elias</span>, who in 1872 traversed and
    mapped a line of upwards of 2000 miles through the almost unknown tracts of
    Western Mongolia, from the Gate in the Great Wall at Kalghan to the Russian
    frontier in the Altai, has done likewise.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> To the Rev. G. <span class="smcap">Moule</span>, of the
    Church Mission at Hang-chau, I owe a mass of interesting matter regarding
    that once great and splendid city, the <span class="smcap">Kinsay</span> of our Traveller, which has
    enabled me, I trust, to effect great improvement both in the Notes and in
    the Map, which illustrate that subject. And to the Rev. <span class="smcap">Carstairs Douglas</span>,
    LL.D., of the English Presbyterian Mission at Amoy, I am scarcely less
    indebted. The learned Professor <span class="smcap">Bruun</span>, of Odessa, whom I never have seen,
    and have little likelihood of ever seeing in this world, has aided me with
    zeal and cordiality like that of old friendship. To Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur Burnell</span>,
    Ph.D., of the Madras Civil Service, I am grateful for many valuable notes
    bearing on these and other geographical studies, and particularly for his
    generous communication of the drawing and photograph of the ancient Cross
    at St. Thomas’s Mount, long before any publication of that subject was made
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>on his own account. My brother officer, Major <span class="smcap">Oliver St. John</span>, R.E., has
    favoured me with a variety of interesting remarks regarding the Persian
    chapters, and has assisted me with new data, very materially correcting the
    Itinerary Map in Kerman.</p>

  <p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blochmann</span> of the Calcutta Madrasa, Sir <span class="smcap">Douglas Forsyth</span>, C.B., lately
    Envoy to Kashgar, M. de <span class="smcap">Mas Latrie</span>, the Historian of Cyprus, Mr. <span class="smcap">Arthur
    Grote</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Eugene Schuyler</span> of the U.S. Legation at St. Petersburg, Dr.
    <span class="smcap">Bushell</span> and Mr. W. F. <span class="smcap">Mayers</span>, of H.M.’s Legation at Peking, Mr. G. <span class="smcap">Phillips</span>
    of Fuchau, Madame <span class="smcap">Olga Fedtchenko</span>, the widow of a great traveller too early
    lost to the world, Colonel <span class="smcap">Keatinge</span>, V.C., C.S.I., Major-General <span class="smcap">Keyes</span>,
    C.B., Dr. <span class="smcap">George Birdwood</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Burgess</span>, of Bombay, my old and valued friend
    Colonel W. H. <span class="smcap">Greathed</span>, C.B., and the Master of Mediæval Geography, M.
    <span class="smcap">D’Avezac</span> himself, with others besides, have kindly lent assistance of one
    kind or another, several of them spontaneously, and the rest in prompt
    answer to my requests.</p>

  <p>Having always attached much importance to the matter of illustrations,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
    I feel greatly indebted to the liberal action of Mr. Murray in enabling me
    largely to increase their number in this edition. Though many are original,
    we have also borrowed a good many;<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> a proceeding which seems to me
    entirely unobjectionable when the engravings are truly illustrative of the
    text, and not hackneyed.</p>

  <p>I regret the augmented bulk of the volumes. There <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>has been some excision,
    but the additions visibly and palpably preponderate. The truth is that
    since the completion of the first edition, just four years ago, large
    additions have been made to the stock of our knowledge bearing on the
    subjects of this Book; and how these additions have continued to come in
    up to the last moment, may be seen in Appendix L,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> which has had to
    undergo repeated interpolation after being put in type. <span class="smcap">Karakorum</span>, for a
    brief space the seat of the widest empire the world has known, has been
    visited; the ruins of <span class="smcap">Shang-tu</span>, the “Xanadu of Cublay Khan,” have been
    explored; <span class="smcap">Pamir</span> and <span class="smcap">Tangut</span> have been penetrated from side to side; the
    famous mountain Road of <span class="smcap">Shen-si</span> has been traversed and described; the
    mysterious <span class="smcap">Caindu</span> has been unveiled; the publication of my lamented friend
    Lieutenant Garnier’s great work on the French Exploration of Indo-China has
    provided a mass of illustration of that <span class="smcap">Yun-nan</span> for which but the other day
    Marco Polo was well-nigh the most recent authority. Nay, the last two years
    have thrown a promise of light even on what seemed the wildest of Marco’s
    stories, and the bones of a veritable <span class="smcap">Ruc</span> from New Zealand lie on the table
    of Professor Owen’s Cabinet!</p>

  <p>M. <span class="smcap">Vivien</span> de St. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>, during the interval of which we have been
    speaking, has published a History of Geography. In treating of Marco
    Polo, he alludes to the first edition of this work, most evidently with
    no intention of disparagement, but speaks of it as merely a revision
    of Marsden’s Book. The last thing I should allow myself to do would be
    to apply to a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>Geographer, whose works I hold in so much esteem, the
    disrespectful definition which the adage quoted in my former Preface<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
    gives of the <i lang="la">vir qui docet quod non sapit</i>; but I feel bound to say that
    on this occasion M. Vivien de St. Martin has permitted himself to pronounce
    on a matter with which he had not made himself acquainted; for the perusal
    of the very first lines of the Preface (I will say nothing of the Book)
    would have shown him that such a notion was utterly unfounded.</p>

  <p>In concluding these “forewords” I am probably taking leave of Marco
    Polo,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the companion of many pleasant and some laborious hours, whilst I
    have been contemplating with him (“<i lang="it">vôlti a levante</i>”) that Orient in which
    I also had spent years not a few.</p>

  <div class="clear center">
    *<span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span><span class="col2">*</span>
  </div>

  <p>And as the writer lingered over this conclusion, his thoughts wandered back
    in reverie to those many venerable libraries in which he had formerly made
    search for mediæval copies of the Traveller’s story; and it seemed to him
    as if he sate in a recess of one of these with a manuscript before him
    which had never till then been examined with any care, and which he found
    with delight to contain passages that appear in no version of the Book
    hitherto known. It was written in clear Gothic text, and in the Old French
    tongue of the early 14th century. Was it possible that he had lighted on
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>long-lost original of Ramusio’s Version? No; it proved to be different.
    Instead of the tedious story of the northern wars, which occupies much of
    our Fourth Book, there were passages occurring in the later history of
    Ser Marco, some years after his release from the Genoese captivity. They
    appeared to contain strange anachronisms certainly; but we have often had
    occasion to remark on puzzles in the chronology of Marco’s story!<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And in
    some respects they tended to justify our intimated suspicion that he was
    a man of deeper feelings and wider sympathies than the book of Rusticiano
    had allowed to appear.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Perhaps this time the Traveller had found an
    amanuensis whose faculties had not been stiffened by fifteen years of
    Malapaga?<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> One of the most important passages ran thus:—</p>

  <p>A loud <em>Amen</em> seemed to peal from without, and the awakened reader started
    to his feet. And lo! it was the thunder of the winter-storm crashing among
    the many-tinted crags of Monte Pellegrino,—with the wind raging as it knows
    how to rage here in sight of the Isles of Æolus, and the rain dashing on
    the glass as ruthlessly as it well could have done, if, instead of Æolic
    Isles and many-tinted crags, the window had fronted a dearer shore beneath
    a northern sky, and looked across the grey Firth to the rain-blurred
    outline of the Lomond Hills.</p>

  <p>But I end, saying to Messer Marco’s prayer, Amen.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[1]</a> It would be ingratitude if this Preface contained no

      Rawlinson, the latter under that of the Commendatore C. Negri.
      Strongly as I feel the too generous appreciation of these labours
      implied in such awards, I confess to have been yet more deeply
      touched and gratified by practical evidence of the approval of the
      two distinguished Travellers mentioned above; as shown by Baron von
      Richthofen in his spontaneous proposal to publish a German version
      of the book under his own immediate supervision (a project in

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> amount of appropriate material, and of acquaintance with the mediæval
    geography of some parts of Asia, which was acquired during the compilation
    of a work of kindred character for the Hakluyt Society,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> could hardly
    fail to suggest as a fresh labour in the same field the preparation of
    a new English edition of Marco Polo. Indeed one kindly critic (in the
    <cite>Examiner</cite>) laid it upon the writer as a duty to undertake that task.</p>

  <p>Though at least one respectable English edition has appeared since
    Marsden’s,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the latter has continued to be the standard edition, and
    maintains not only its reputation but its market value. It is indeed
    the work of a sagacious, learned, and right-minded man, which can never
    be spoken of otherwise than with respect. But since Marsden published
    his quarto (1818) vast stores of new knowledge have become available in
    elucidation both of the contents of Marco Polo’s book and of its literary
    history. The works of writers such as Klaproth, Abel Rémusat, D’Avezac,
    Reinaud, Quatremère, Julien, I. J. Schmidt, Gildemeister, Ritter,
    Hammer-Purgstall, Erdmann, D’Ohsson, Defrémery, Elliot, Erskine, and many
    more, which throw light directly or incidentally on Marco Polo, have, for
    the most part, appeared since then. Nor, as regards the literary history of
    the book, were any just views possible at a time when what may be called
    the <cite>Fontal</cite> MSS. (in French) were unpublished and unexamined.</p>

  <p>Besides the works which have thus occasionally or incidentally <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>thrown light
    upon the Traveller’s book, various editions of the book itself have since
    Marsden’s time been published in foreign countries, accompanied by comments
    of more or less value. All have contributed something to the illustration
    of the book or its history; the last and most learned of the editors,
    M. Pauthier, has so contributed in large measure. I had occasion some
    years ago<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> to speak freely my opinion of the merits and demerits of M.
    Pauthier’s work; and to the latter at least I have no desire to recur here.</p>

  <p>Another of his critics, a much more accomplished as well as more favourable
    one,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> seems to intimate the opinion that there would scarcely be room in
    future for new commentaries. Something of the kind was said of Marsden’s at
    the time of its publication. I imagine, however, that whilst our libraries
    endure the <cite>Iliad</cite> will continue to find new translators, and Marco
    Polo—though one hopes not so plentifully—new editors.</p>

  <p>The justification of the book’s existence must however be looked for, and
    it is hoped may be found, in the book itself, and not in the Preface. The
    work claims to be judged as a whole, but it may be allowable, in these days
    of scanty leisure, to indicate below a few instances of what is believed
    to be new matter in an edition of Marco Polo; by which however it is by no
    means intended that all such matter is claimed by the editor as his own.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span></p>

  <p>From the commencement of the work it was felt that the task was one which
    no man, though he were far better equipped and much more conveniently
    situated than the present writer, could satisfactorily accomplish from his
    own resources, and help was sought on special points wherever it seemed
    likely to be found. In scarcely any quarter was the application made in
    vain. Some who have aided most materially are indeed very old and valued
    friends; but to many others who have done the same the applicant was
    unknown; and some of these again, with whom the editor began correspondence
    on this subject as a stranger, he is happy to think that he may now call
    friends.</p>

  <p>To none am I more indebted than to the Comm. <span class="smcap">Guglielmo Berchet</span>, of Venice,
    for his ample, accurate, and generous assistance in furnishing me with
    Venetian documents, and in many other ways. Especial thanks are also due to
    Dr. <span class="smcap">William Lockhart</span>, who has supplied the materials for some of the most
    valuable illustrations; to Lieutenant <span class="smcap">Francis Garnier</span>, of the French Navy,
    the gallant and accomplished leader (after the death of Captain Doudart
    de la Grée) of the memorable expedition <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</span>up the Mekong to Yun-nan; to the
    Rev. Dr. <span class="smcap">Caldwell</span>, of the S. P. G. Mission in Tinnevelly, for copious and

    R.E., Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur Phayre</span>, and Colonel <span class="smcap">Henry Man</span>, for very valuable notes
    and other aid; to Professor A. <span class="smcap">Schiefner</span>, of St. Petersburg, for his
    courteous communication of very interesting illustrations not otherwise
    accessible; to Major-General <span class="smcap">Alexander Cunningham</span>, of my own corps, for
    several valuable letters; to my friends Dr. <span class="smcap">Thomas Oldham</span>, Director of the

    Mr. <span class="smcap">James Fergusson</span>, F.R.S., Sir <span class="smcap">Bartle Frere</span>, and Dr. <span class="smcap">Hugh Cleghorn</span>,
    for constant interest in the work and readiness to assist its progress;
    to Mr. A. <span class="smcap">Wylie</span>, the learned Agent of the B. and F. Bible Society at
    Shang-hai, for valuable help; to the Hon. G. P. <span class="smcap">Marsh</span>, U.S. Minister at the
    Court of Italy, for untiring kindness in the communication of his ample
    stores of knowledge, and of books. I have also to express my obligations
    to Comm. <span class="smcap">Nicolò Barozzi</span>, Director of the City Museum at Venice, and to
    Professor A. S. <span class="smcap">Minotto</span>, of the same city; to Professor <span class="smcap">Arminius Vámbéry</span>,
    the eminent traveller; to Professor <span class="smcap">Flückiger</span> of Bern; to the Rev. H.

    Commendatore <span class="smcap">Negri</span> the indefatigable President of the Italian Geographical
    Society; to Dr. <span class="smcap">Zotenberg</span>, of the Great Paris Library, and to M. <span class="smcap">Ch.

    Mr. C. <span class="smcap">Gardner</span>, of the Consular Establishment in China. There are not a few
    others to whom my thanks are equally due; but it is feared that the number
    of names already mentioned may seem ridiculous, compared with the result,
    to those who do not appreciate from how many quarters the facts needful
    for a work which in its course intersects so many fields required to be
    collected, one by one. I must not, however, omit acknowledgments to the
    present Earl of <span class="smcap">Derby</span> for his courteous permission, when at the head of the
    Foreign Office, to inspect Mr. Abbott’s valuable unpublished Report upon
    some of the Interior Provinces of Persia; and to Mr. T. T. <span class="smcap">Cooper</span>, one of
    the most adventurous travellers of modern times, for leave to quote some
    passages from his unpublished diary.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Henry Yule</span> was the youngest son of Major William Yule, by his first wife,
    Elizabeth Paterson, and was born at Inveresk, in Midlothian, on 1st May,
    1820. He was named after an <em>aunt</em> who, like Miss Ferrier’s immortal
    heroine, owned a man’s name.</p>

  <p>On his father’s side he came of a hardy agricultural stock,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> improved
    by a graft from that highly-cultured tree, Rose of Kilravock.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Through
    his mother, a somewhat prosaic person herself, he inherited strains from
    Huguenot and Highland ancestry. There were recognisable traces of all
    these elements <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</span>in Henry Yule, and as was well said by one of his oldest
    friends: “He was one of those curious racial compounds one finds on the
    east side of Scotland, in whom the hard Teutonic grit is sweetened by the
    artistic spirit of the more genial Celt.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> His father, an officer of
    the Bengal army (born 1764, died 1839), was a man of cultivated tastes
    and enlightened mind, a good Persian and Arabic scholar, and possessed
    of much miscellaneous Oriental learning. During the latter years of his
    career in India, he served successively as Assistant Resident at the (then
    independent) courts of Lucknow<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Delhi. In the latter office his chief
    was the noble Ouchterlony. William Yule, together with his younger brother
    Udny,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> returned home in 1806. “A recollection of their voyage was that
    they hailed an outward bound ship, somewhere off the Cape, through the
    trumpet: ‘What news?’ Answer: ‘The King’s mad, and Humfrey’s beat Mendoza’
    (two celebrated prize-fighters and often matched). ‘Nothing more?’ ‘Yes,
    Bonapart<em>y</em>’s made his <em>Mother</em> King of Holland!’</p>

  <p>“Before his retirement, William Yule was offered the Lieut.-Governorship
    of St. Helena. Two of the detailed privileges of the office were residence
    at Longwood (afterwards the house of Napoleon), and the use of a certain
    number of the Company’s slaves. Major Yule, who was a strong supporter of
    the anti-slavery cause till its triumph in 1834, often recalled both of
    these offers with amusement.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxix">xxix</span></p>

  <p>William Yule was a man of generous chivalrous nature, who took large views
    of life, apt to be unfairly stigmatised as Radical in the narrow Tory
    reaction that prevailed in Scotland during the early years of the 19th
    century.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Devoid of literary ambition, he wrote much for his private
    pleasure, and his knowledge and library (rich in Persian and Arabic MSS.)
    were always placed freely at the service of his friends and correspondents,
    some of whom, such as Major C. Stewart and Mr. William Erskine, were more
    given to publication than himself. He never travelled without a little
    8vo MS. of Hafiz, which often lay under his pillow. Major Yule’s only
    printed work was a lithographed edition of the <cite>Apothegms</cite> of ’Ali, the son
    of Abu Talib, in the Arabic, with an old Persian version and an English
    translation interpolated by himself. “This was privately issued in 1832,
    when the Duchesse d’Angoulême was living at Edinburgh, and the little
    work was inscribed to her, with whom an accident of neighbourhood and her
    kindness to the Major’s youngest child had brought him into relations of
    goodwill.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>Henry Yule’s childhood was mainly spent at Inveresk. He used to say that
    his earliest recollection was sitting with the little cousin, who long
    after became his wife, on the doorstep of her father’s house in George
    Street, Edinburgh (now the Northern Club), listening to the performance of
    a passing piper. There was another episode which he recalled with humorous
    satisfaction. Fired by his father’s tales of the jungle, Yule (then about
    six years old) proceeded to improvise an elephant pit in the back garden,
    only too successfully, for soon, with mingled terror and delight, he saw
    his uncle John<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> fall headlong into the snare. He lost his mother before
    he was eight, and almost his only remembrance of her was the circumstance
    of her having given him a little lantern to light him home on winter
    nights from his first school. On Sundays it was the Major’s custom <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxx">xxx</span>to lend
    his children, as a picture-book, a folio Arabic translation of the Four
    Gospels, printed at Rome in 1591, which contained excellent illustrations
    from Italian originals.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Of the pictures in this volume Yule seems never
    to have tired. The last page bore a MS. note in Latin to the effect that
    the volume had been read in the Chaldæan Desert by <cite>Georgius Strachanus</cite>,
    <cite>Milnensis</cite>, <cite>Scotus</cite>, who long remained unidentified, not to say mythical, in
    Yule’s mind. But George Strachan never passed from his memory, and having
    ultimately run him to earth, Yule, sixty years later, published the results
    in an interesting article.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p>Two or three years after his wife’s death, Major Yule removed to Edinburgh,
    and established himself in Regent’s Terrace, on the face of the Calton
    Hill.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This continued to be Yule’s home until his father’s death,
    shortly before he went to India. “Here he learned to love the wide scenes
    of sea and land spread out around that hill—a love he never lost, at home
    or far away. And long years after, with beautiful Sicilian hills before him
    and a lovely sea, he writes words of fond recollection of the bleak Fife
    hills, and the grey Firth of Forth.”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>Yule now followed his elder brother, Robert, to the famous High School, and
    in the summer holidays the two made expeditions <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxi">xxxi</span>to the West Highlands, the
    Lakes of Cumberland, and elsewhere. Major Yule chose his boys to have every
    reasonable indulgence and advantage, and when the British Association, in
    1834, held its first Edinburgh meeting, Henry received a member’s ticket.
    So, too, when the passing of the Reform Bill was celebrated in the same
    year by a great banquet, at which Lord Grey and other prominent politicians
    were present, Henry was sent to the dinner, probably the youngest guest
    there.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

  <p>At this time the intention was that Henry should go to Cambridge (where his
    name was, indeed, entered), and after taking his degree study for the Bar.
    With this view he was, in 1833, sent to Waith, near Ripon, to be coached
    by the Rev. H. P. Hamilton, author of a well-known treatise, <cite>On Conic
    Sections</cite>, and afterwards Dean of Salisbury. At his tutor’s hospitable
    rectory Yule met many notabilities of the day. One of them was Professor
    Sedgwick.</p>

  <p>There was rumoured at this time the discovery of the first known (?) fossil
    monkey, but its tail was missing. “Depend upon it, Daniel O’Conell’s
    got hold of it!” said ‘Adam’ briskly.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Yule was very happy with Mr.
    Hamilton and his kind wife, but on his tutor’s removal to Cambridge other
    arrangements became necessary, and in 1835 he was transferred to the care
    of the Rev. James Challis, rector of Papworth St. Everard, a place which
    “had little to recommend it except a dulness which made reading almost a
    necessity.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Mr. Challis had at this time two other resident pupils,
    who both, in most diverse ways, attained distinction in the Church. These
    were John Mason Neale, the future eminent ecclesiologist and founder of
    the devoted Anglican Sisterhood of St. Margaret, and Harvey Goodwin, long
    afterwards the studious and large-minded Bishop of Carlisle. With the
    latter, Yule remained on terms of cordial friendship to the end of his
    life. Looking back through more than fifty years to these boyish days,
    Bishop Goodwin wrote that Yule then “showed much more liking for Greek
    plays and for German than for mathematics, though he had considerable
    geometrical <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxii">xxxii</span>ingenuity.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> On one occasion, having solved a problem that
    puzzled Goodwin, Yule thus discriminated the attainments of the three
    pupils: “The difference between you and me is this: You like it and can’t
    do it; I don’t like it and can do it. Neale neither likes it nor can do
    it.” Not bad criticism for a boy of fifteen.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

  <p>On Mr. Challis being appointed Plumerian Professor at Cambridge, in the
    spring of 1836, Yule had to leave him, owing to want of room at the
    Observatory, and he became for a time, a most dreary time, he said, a
    student at University College, London.</p>

  <p>By this time Yule had made up his mind that not London and the Law, but
    India and the Army should be his choice, and accordingly in Feb. 1837
    he joined the East India Company’s Military College at Addiscombe. From
    Addiscombe he passed out, in December 1838, at the head of the cadets of
    his term (taking the prize sword<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>), and having been duly appointed to
    the Bengal Engineers, proceeded early in 1839 to the Headquarters of the
    Royal Engineers at Chatham, where, according to custom, he was enrolled as
    a “local and temporary Ensign.” For such was then the invidious designation
    at Chatham of the young Engineer officers of the Indian army, who ranked
    as full lieutenants in their own Service, from the time of leaving
    Addiscombe.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Yule once audaciously tackled the formidable Pasley on
    this very grievance. The venerable Director, after a minute’s pondering,
    replied: “Well, I don’t remember what the reason was, but I have <em>no</em> doubt
    (<i lang="la">staccato</i>) it ... was ... a very ... <em>good</em> reason.”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

  <p>“When Yule appeared among us at Chatham in 1839,” said his friend
    Collinson, “he at once took a prominent place in our little Society by
    his slightly advanced age [he was then 18½], but more by his strong
    character.... His earlier education ... gave him a better classical
    knowledge than most of us possessed; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiii">xxxiii</span>then he had the reserve and
    self-possession characteristic of his race; but though he took small
    part in the games and other recreations of our time, his knowledge,
    his native humour, and his good comradeship, and especially his strong
    sense of right and wrong, made him both admired and respected.... Yule
    was not a scientific engineer, though he had a good general knowledge
    of the different branches of his profession; his natural capacity lay
    rather in varied knowledge, combined with a strong understanding and an
    excellent memory, and also a peculiar power as a draughtsman, which proved
    of great value in after life.... Those were nearly the last days of the
    old <i lang="fr">régime</i>, of the orthodox double sap and cylindrical pontoons, when
    Pasley’s genius had been leading to new ideas, and when Lintorn Simmons’
    power, G. Leach’s energy, W. Jervois’ skill, and R. Tylden’s talent were
    developing under the wise example of Henry Harness.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

  <p>In the Royal Engineer mess of those days (the present anteroom), the
    portrait of Henry Yule now faces that of his first chief, Sir Henry
    Harness. General Collinson said that the pictures appeared to eye each
    other as if the subjects were continuing one of those friendly disputes in
    which they so often engaged.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

  <p>It was in this room that Yule, Becher, Collinson, and other young R.E.’s,
    profiting by the temporary absence of the austere Colonel Pasley, acted
    some plays, including <cite>Pizarro</cite>. Yule bore the humble part of one of the
    Peruvian Mob in this performance, of which he has left a droll account.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

  <p>On the completion of his year at Chatham, Yule prepared to sail for India,
    but first went to take leave of his relative, General White. An accident
    prolonged his stay, and before he left he had proposed to and been refused
    by his cousin Annie. This occurrence, his first check, seems to have cast
    rather a gloom over his start for India. He went by the then newly-opened
    Overland Route, visiting Portugal, stopping at Gibraltar to see <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxiv">xxxiv</span>his cousin,
    Major (afterwards General) Patrick Yule, R.E.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He was under orders “to
    stop at Aden (then recently acquired), to report on the water supply, and
    to deliver a set of meteorological and magnetic instruments for starting
    an observatory there. The overland journey then really meant so; tramping
    across the desert to Suez with camels and Arabs, a proceeding not conducive
    to the preservation of delicate instruments; and on arriving at Aden he
    found that the intended observer was dead, the observatory not commenced,
    and the instruments all broken. There was thus nothing left for him but to
    go on at once” to Calcutta,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> where he arrived at the end of 1840.</p>

  <p>His first service lay in the then wild Khasia Hills, whither he was
    detached for the purpose of devising means for the transport of the local
    coal to the plains. In spite of the depressing character of the climate
    (Cherrapunjee boasts the highest rainfall on record), Yule thoroughly
    enjoyed himself, and always looked back with special pleasure on the
    time he spent here. He was unsuccessful in the object of his mission,
    the obstacles to cheap transport offered by the dense forests and mighty
    precipices proving insurmountable, but he gathered a wealth of interesting
    observations on the country and people, a very primitive Mongolian race,
    which he subsequently embodied in two excellent and most interesting papers
    (the first he ever published).<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

  <p>In the following year, 1842, Yule was transferred to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxv">xxxv</span>irrigation canals
    of the north-west with head-quarters at Kurnaul. Here he had for chief
    Captain (afterwards General Sir William) Baker, who became his dearest
    and most steadfast friend. Early in 1843 Yule had his first experience of
    field service. The death without heir of the Khytul Rajah, followed by the
    refusal of his family to surrender the place to the native troops sent to
    receive it, obliged Government to send a larger force against it, and the
    canal officers were ordered to join this. Yule was detailed to serve under
    Captain Robert Napier (afterwards F.-M. Lord Napier of Magdala). Their
    immediate duty was to mark out the route for a night march of the troops,
    barring access to all side roads, and neither officer having then had any
    experience of war, they performed the duty “with all the elaborate care of
    novices.” Suddenly there was an alarm, a light detected, and a night attack
    awaited, when the danger resolved itself into Clerk Sahib’s <em>khansamah</em>
    with welcome hot coffee!<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Their hopes were disappointed, there was no
    fighting, and the Fort of Khytul was found deserted by the enemy. It “was
    a strange scene of confusion—all the paraphernalia and accumulation of
    odds and ends of a wealthy native family lying about and inviting loot.
    I remember one beautiful crutch-stick of ebony with two rams’ heads in
    jade. I took it and sent it in to the political authority, intending to
    buy it when sold. There was a sale, but my stick never appeared. Somebody
    had a more developed taste in jade.... Amid the general rummage that was
    going on, an officer of British Infantry had been put over a part of the
    palace supposed to contain treasure, and they—officers and all—were helping
    themselves. Henry Lawrence was one of the politicals under George Clerk.
    When the news of this affair came to him I was present. It was in a white
    marble loggia in the palace, where was a white marble chair or throne on a
    basement. Lawrence was sitting on this throne in great excitement. He wore
    an Afghan <em>choga</em>, a sort of dressing-gown garment, and this, and his thin
    locks, and thin beard were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvi">xxxvi</span>streaming in the wind. He always dwells in my
    memory as a sort of pythoness on her tripod under the afflatus.”<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

  <p>During his Indian service, Yule had renewed and continued by letters his
    suit to Miss White, and persistency prevailing at last, he soon after the
    conclusion of the Khytul affair applied for leave to go home to be married.
    He sailed from Bombay in May, 1843, and in September of the same year was
    married, at Bath, to the gifted and large-hearted woman who, to the end,
    remained the strongest and happiest influence in his life.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

  <p>Yule sailed for India with his wife in November 1843. The next two years
    were employed chiefly in irrigation work, and do not call for special note.
    They were very happy years, except in the one circumstance that the climate
    having seriously affected his wife’s health, and she having been brought
    to death’s door, partly by illness, but still more by the drastic medical
    treatment of those days, she was imperatively ordered back to England by
    the doctors, who forbade her return to India.</p>

  <p>Having seen her on board ship, Yule returned to duty on the canals. The
    close of that year, December, 1845, brought some variety to his work, as
    the outbreak of the first Sikh War called nearly all the canal officers
    into the field. “They went up to the front by long marches, passing through
    no stations, and quite unable to obtain any news of what had occurred,
    though on the 21st December the guns of Ferozshah were distinctly heard in
    their camp at Pehoa, at a distance of 115 miles south-east from the field,
    and some days later they came successively on the fields of Moodkee and of
    Ferozshah itself, with all the recent traces of battle. When the party of
    irrigation officers reached head-quarters, the arrangements for attacking
    the Sikh army in its entrenchments at Sobraon were beginning (though
    suspended till weeks later for the arrival of the tardy siege guns), and
    the opposed forces were lying in sight of each other.”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

  <p>Yule’s share in this campaign was limited to the sufficiently arduous
    task of bridging the Sutlej for the advance of the British army. It is
    characteristic of the man that for this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxvii">xxxvii</span>reason he always abstained from
    wearing his medal for the Sutlej campaign.</p>

  <p>His elder brother, Robert Yule, then in the 16th Lancers, took part in that
    magnificent charge of his regiment at the battle of Aliwal (Jan. 28, 1846)
    which the Great Duke is said to have pronounced unsurpassed in history.
    From particulars gleaned from his brother and others present in the action,
    Henry Yule prepared a spirited sketch of the episode, which was afterwards
    published as a coloured lithograph by M‘Lean (Haymarket).</p>

  <p>At the close of the war, Yule succeeded his friend Strachey as Executive
    Engineer of the northern division of the Ganges Canal, with his
    head-quarters at Roorkee, “the division which, being nearest the hills and
    crossed by intermittent torrents of great breadth and great volume when in
    flood, includes the most important and interesting engineering works.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

  <p>At Roorkee were the extensive engineering workshops connected with the
    canal. Yule soon became so accustomed to the din as to be undisturbed by
    the noise, but the unpunctuality and carelessness of the native workmen
    sorely tried his patience, of which Nature had endowed him with but a small
    reserve. Vexed with himself for letting temper so often get the better of
    him, Yule’s conscientious mind devised a characteristic remedy. Each time
    that he lost his temper, he transferred a fine of two rupees (then about
    five shillings) from his right to his left pocket. When about to leave
    Roorkee, he devoted this accumulation of self-imposed fines to the erection
    of a sun-dial, to teach the natives the value of time. The late Sir James
    Caird, who told this legend of Roorkee as he heard it there in 1880, used
    to add, with a humorous twinkle of his kindly eyes, “It was a <em>very</em>
    handsome dial.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

  <p>From September, 1845, to March, 1847, Yule was much occupied
    intermittently, in addition to his professional work, by service on a
    Committee appointed by Government “to investigate the causes of the
    unhealthiness which has existed at Kurnal, and other portions of the
    country along the line of the Delhi Canal,” and further, to report “whether
    an injurious <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxviii">xxxviii</span>effect on the health of the people of the Doab is, or is not,
    likely to be produced by the contemplated Ganges Canal.”</p>

  <p>“A very elaborate investigation was made by the Committee, directed
    principally to ascertaining what relation subsisted between certain
    physical conditions of the different districts, and the liability of their
    inhabitants to miasmatic fevers.” The principal conclusion of the Committee
    was, “that in the extensive epidemic of 1843, when Kurnaul suffered so
    seriously ... the greater part of the evils observed had not been the
    necessary and unavoidable results of canal irrigation, but were due to
    interference with the natural drainage of the country, to the saturation
    of stiff and retentive soils, and to natural disadvantages of site,
    enhanced by excess of moisture. As regarded the Ganges Canal, they were
    of opinion that, with due attention to drainage, improvement rather than
    injury to the general health might be expected to follow the introduction
    of canal irrigation.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In an unpublished note written about 1889, Yule
    records his ultimate opinion as follows: “At this day, and after the
    large experience afforded by the Ganges Canal, I feel sure that a verdict
    so favourable to the sanitary results of canal irrigation would not be
    given.” Still the fact remains that the Ganges Canal has been the source of
    unspeakable blessings to an immense population.</p>

  <p>The Second Sikh War saw Yule again with the army in the field, and on 13th
    Jan. 1849, he was present at the dismal ‘Victory’ of Chillianwallah, of
    which his most vivid recollection seemed to be the sudden apparition of
    Henry Lawrence, fresh from London, but still clad in the legendary Afghan cloak.</p>

  <p>On the conclusion of the Punjab campaign, Yule, whose health had suffered,
    took furlough and went home to his wife. For the next three years they
    resided chiefly in Scotland, though paying occasional visits to the
    Continent, and about 1850 Yule bought a house in Edinburgh. There he
    wrote “The African Squadron vindicated” (a pamphlet which was afterwards
    re-published in French), translated Schiller’s <i lang="de">Kampf mit dem Drachen</i>
    into English verse, delivered Lectures on Fortification at the, now
    long defunct, Scottish Naval and Military Academy, wrote on Tibet for
    his friend Blackwood’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxxix">xxxix</span>Magazine, attended the 1850 Edinburgh Meeting of
    the British Association, wrote his excellent lines, “On the Loss of the
    <cite>Birkenhead</cite>,” and commenced his first serious study of Marco Polo (by
    whose wondrous tale, however, he had already been captivated as a boy
    in his father’s library—in Marsden’s edition probably). But the most
    noteworthy literary result of these happy years was that really fascinating
    volume, entitled <cite>Fortification for Officers of the Army and Students of
    Military History</cite>, a work that has remained unique of its kind. This was
    published by Blackwood in 1851, and seven years later received the honour
    of (unauthorised) translation into French. Yule also occupied himself a
    good deal at this time with the practice of photography, a pursuit to which
    he never after reverted.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1852, Yule made an interesting little semi-professional
    tour in company with a brother officer, his accomplished friend, Major R.
    B. Smith. Beginning with Kelso, “the only one of the Teviotdale Abbeys
    which I had not as yet seen,” they made their way leisurely through the
    north of England, examining with impartial care abbeys and cathedrals,
    factories, brick-yards, foundries, timber-yards, docks, and railway works.
    On this occasion Yule, contrary to his custom, kept a journal, and a few
    excerpts may be given here, as affording some notion of his casual talk to
    those who did not know him.</p>

  <p>At Berwick-on-Tweed he notes the old ramparts of the town: “These, erected
    in Elizabeth’s time, are interesting as being, I believe, the only existing
    sample in England of the bastioned system of the 16th century.... The
    outline of the works seems perfect enough, though both earth and stone
    work are in great disrepair. The bastions are large with obtuse angles,
    square orillons, and double flanks originally casemated, and most of
    them crowned with cavaliers.” On the way to Durham, “much amused by the
    discussions of two passengers, one a smooth-spoken, semi-clerical looking
    person; the other a brusque well-to-do attorney with a Northumbrian
    burr. Subject, among others, Protection. The Attorney all for ‘cheap
    bread’— ‘You wouldn’t rob the poor man of his loaf,’ and so forth. ‘You
    must go with the <em>stgheam</em>, sir, you must go with the stgheam.’ ‘I never
    did, Mr. Thompson, and I never will,’ said the other in an oily manner,
    singularly inconsistent with the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xl">xl</span>sentiment.” At Durham they dined with a
    dignitary of the Church, and Yule was roasted by being placed with his
    back to an enormous fire. “Coals are cheap at Durham,” he notes feelingly,
    adding, “The party we found as heavy as any Edinburgh one. Smith, indeed,
    evidently has had little experience of really stupid Edinburgh parties,
    for he had never met with anything approaching to this before.” (Happy
    Smith!) But thanks to the kindness and hospitality of the astronomer,
    Mr. Chevalier, and his gifted daughter, they had a delightful visit to
    beautiful Durham, and came away full of admiration for the (then newly
    established) University, and its grand <em>locale</em>. They went on to stay
    with an uncle by marriage of Yule’s, in Yorkshire. At dinner he was asked
    by his host to explain Foucault’s pendulum experiment. “I endeavoured to
    explain it somewhat, I hope, to the satisfaction of his doubts, but not at
    all to that of Mr. G. M., who most resolutely declined to take in <em>any</em>
    elucidation, coming at last to the conclusion that he entirely differed
    with me as to what North meant, and that it was useless to argue until we
    could agree about that!” They went next to Leeds, to visit Kirkstall Abbey,
    “a mediæval fossil, curiously embedded among the squalid brickwork and
    chimney stalks of a manufacturing suburb. Having established ourselves at
    the hotel, we went to deliver a letter to Mr. Hope, the official assignee,
    a very handsome, aristocratic-looking gentleman, who seemed as much out
    of place at Leeds as the Abbey.” At Leeds they visited the flax mills of
    Messrs. Marshall, “a firm noted for the conscientious care they take of
    their workpeople.... We mounted on the roof of the building, which is
    covered with grass, and formerly was actually grazed by a few sheep, until
    the repeated inconvenience of their tumbling through the glass domes put a
    stop to this.” They next visited some tile and brickworks on land belonging
    to a friend. “The owner of the tile works, a well-to-do burgher, and the
    apparent model of a West Riding Radical, received us in rather a dubious
    way: ‘There are a many people has come and brought introductions, and
    looked at all my works, and then gone and set up for themselves close by.
    Now des you mean to say that you be really come all the way from Beng<em>u</em>l?’
    ‘Yes, indeed we have, and we are going all the way back again, though we
    didn’t exactly come from there to look at your brickworks.’ ‘Then you’re
    not in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xli">xli</span>the brick-making line, are you?’ ‘Why we’ve had a good deal to do
    with making bricks, and may have again; but we’ll engage that if we set up
    for ourselves, it shall be ten thousand miles from you.’ This seemed in
    some degree to set his mind at rest....”</p>

  <p>“A dismal day, with occasional showers, prevented our seeing Sheffield to
    advantage. On the whole, however, it is more cheerful and has more of a
    country-town look than Leeds—a place utterly without beauty of aspect. At
    Leeds you have vast barrack-like factories, with their usual suburbs of
    squalid rows of brick cottages, and everywhere the tall spiracles of the
    steam, which seems the pervading power of the place. Everything there is
    machinery—the machine is the intelligent agent, it would seem, the man its
    slave, standing by to tend it and pick up a broken thread now and then.
    At Sheffield ... you might go through most of the streets without knowing
    anything of the kind was going on. And steam here, instead of being a
    ruler, is a drudge, turning a grindstone or rolling out a bar of steel, but
    all the accuracy and skill of hand is the Man’s. And consequently there
    was, we thought, a healthier aspect about the men engaged. None of the
    Rodgers remain who founded the firm in my father’s time. I saw some pairs
    of his scissors in the show-room still kept under the name of <em>Persian</em>
    scissors.”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

  <p>From Sheffield Yule and his friend proceeded to Boston, “where there is
    the most exquisite church tower I have ever seen,” and thence to Lincoln,
    Peterborough, and Ely, ending their tour at Cambridge, where Yule spent a
    few delightful days.</p>

  <p>In the autumn the great Duke of Wellington died, and Yule witnessed the
    historic pageant of his funeral. His furlough was now nearly expired, and
    early in December he again embarked for India, leaving his wife and only
    child, of a few <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlii">xlii</span>weeks old, behind him. Some verses dated “Christmas Day
    near the Equator,” show how much he felt the separation.</p>

  <p>Shortly after his return to Bengal, Yule received orders to proceed to
    Aracan, and to examine and report upon the passes between Aracan and Burma,
    as also to improve communications and select suitable sites for fortified
    posts to hold the same. These orders came to Yule quite unexpectedly late
    one Saturday evening, but he completed all preparations and started at
    daybreak on the following Monday, 24th Jan. 1853.</p>

  <p>From Calcutta to Khyook Phyoo, Yule proceeded by steamer, and thence up the
    river in the <cite>Tickler</cite> gunboat to Krenggyuen. “Our course lay through a
    wilderness of wooded islands (50 to 200 feet high) and bays, sailing when
    we could, anchoring when neither wind nor tide served ... slow progress
    up the river. More and more like the creeks and lagoons of the Niger or a
    Guiana river rather than anything I looked for in India. The densest tree
    jungle covers the shore down into the water. For miles no sign of human
    habitation, but now and then at rare intervals one sees a patch of hillside
    rudely cleared, with the bare stems of the burnt trees still standing....
    Sometimes, too, a dark tunnel-like creek runs back beneath the thick vault
    of jungle, and from it silently steals out a slim canoe, manned by two or
    three wild-looking Mugs or Kyens (people of the Hills), driving it rapidly
    along with their short paddles held vertically, exactly like those of the
    Red men on the American rivers.”</p>

  <p>At the military post of Bokhyong, near Krenggyuen, he notes (5th Feb.) that
    “Captain Munro, the adjutant, can scarcely believe that I was present at
    the Duke of Wellington’s funeral, of which he read but a few days ago in
    the newspapers, and here am I, one of the spectators, a guest in this wild
    spot among the mountains—2½ months since I left England.”</p>

  <p>Yule’s journal of his arduous wanderings in these border wilds is full
    of interest, but want of space forbids further quotation. From a note on
    the fly-leaf it appears that from the time of quitting the gun-boat at
    Krenggyuen to his arrival at Toungoop he covered about 240 miles on foot,
    and that under immense difficulties, even as to food. He commemorated his
    tribulations in some cheery humorous verse, but ultimately fell seriously
    ill of the local fever, aided doubtless by previous exposure and privation.
    His servants successively fell ill, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliii">xliii</span>some died and others had to be sent
    back, food supplies failed, and the route through those dense forests was
    uncertain; yet under all difficulties he seems never to have grumbled or
    lost heart. And when things were nearly at the worst, Yule restored the
    spirits of his local escort by improvising a wappenshaw, with a Sheffield
    gardener’s knife, which he happened to have with him, for prize! When at
    last Yule emerged from the wilds and on 25th March marched into Prome,
    he was taken for his own ghost! “Found Fraser (of the Engineers) in a
    rambling phoongyee house, just under the great gilt pagoda. I went up to
    him announcing myself, and his astonishment was so great that he would
    scarcely shake hands!” It was on this occasion at Prome that Yule first met
    his future chief Captain Phayre—“a very young-looking man—very cordial,” a
    description no less applicable to General Sir Arthur Phayre at the age of
    seventy!</p>

  <p>After some further wanderings, Yule embarked at Sandong, and returned by
    water, touching at Kyook Phyoo and Akyab, to Calcutta, which he reached on
    1st May—his birthday.</p>

  <p>The next four months were spent in hard work at Calcutta. In August, Yule
    received orders to proceed to Singapore, and embarked on the 29th. His duty
    was to report on the defences of the Straits Settlements, with a view to
    their improvement. Yule’s recommendations were sanctioned by Government,
    but his journal bears witness to the prevalence then, as since, of the
    penny-wise-pound-foolish system in our administration. On all sides he was
    met by difficulties in obtaining sites for batteries, etc., for which heavy
    compensation was demanded, when by the exercise of reasonable foresight,
    the same might have been secured earlier at a nominal price.</p>

  <p>Yule’s journal contains a very bright and pleasing picture of Singapore,
    where he found that the majority of the European population “were
    evidently, from their tongues, from benorth the Tweed, a circumstance which
    seems to be true of four-fifths of the Singaporeans. Indeed, if I taught
    geography, I should be inclined to class Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, and
    Singapore together as the four chief towns of Scotland.”</p>

  <p>Work on the defences kept Yule in Singapore and its neighbourhood until
    the end of November, when he embarked for Bengal. On his return to
    Calcutta, Yule was appointed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xliv">xliv</span>Deputy Consulting Engineer for Railways at
    Head-quarters. In this post he had for chief his old friend Baker, who had
    in 1851 been appointed by the Governor-General, Lord Dalhousie, Consulting
    Engineer for Railways to Government. The office owed its existence to
    the recently initiated great experiment of railway construction under
    Government guarantee.</p>

  <p>The subject was new to Yule, “and therefore called for hard and anxious
    labour. He, however, turned his strong sense and unbiased view to the
    general question of railway communication in India, with the result that he
    became a vigorous supporter of the idea of narrow gauge and cheap lines in
    the parts of that country outside of the main trunk lines of traffic.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

  <p>The influence of Yule, and that of his intimate friends and ultimate
    successors in office, Colonels R. Strachey and Dickens, led to the adoption
    of the narrow (metre) gauge over a great part of India. Of this matter more
    will be said further on; it is sufficient at this stage to note that it was
    occupying Yule’s thoughts, and that he had already taken up the position
    in this question that he thereafter maintained through life. The office of
    Consulting Engineer to Government for Railways ultimately developed into
    the great Department of Public Works.</p>

  <p>As related by Yule, whilst Baker “held this appointment, Lord Dalhousie
    was in the habit of making use of his advice in a great variety of
    matters connected with Public Works projects and questions, but which
    had nothing to do with guaranteed railways, there being at that time no
    officer attached to the Government of India, whose proper duty it was to
    deal with such questions. In August, 1854, the Government of India sent
    home to the Court of Directors a despatch and a series of minutes by the
    Governor-General and his Council, in which the constitution of the Public
    Works Department as a separate branch of administration, both in the local
    governments and the government of India itself, was urged on a detailed plan.”</p>

  <p>In this communication Lord Dalhousie stated his desire to appoint Major
    Baker to the projected office of Secretary for the Department of Public
    Works. In the spring of 1855 these recommendations were carried out by
    the creation of the Department, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlv">xlv</span>with Baker as Secretary and Yule as Under
    Secretary for Public Works.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Yule’s services were called to a very different field, but
    without his vacating his new appointment, which he was allowed to retain.
    Not long after the conclusion of the second Burmese War, the King of Burma
    sent a friendly mission to the Governor-General, and in 1855 a return
    Embassy was despatched to the Court of Ava, under Colonel Arthur Phayre,
    with Henry Yule as Secretary, an appointment the latter owed as much to
    Lord Dalhousie’s personal wish as to Phayre’s good-will. The result of this
    employment was Yule’s first geographical book, a large volume entitled
    <cite>Mission to the Court of Ava in 1855</cite>, originally printed in India, but
    subsequently re-issued in an embellished form at home (see over leaf).
    To the end of his life, Yule looked back to this “social progress up the
    Irawady, with its many quaint and pleasant memories, as to a bright and
    joyous holiday.”<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It was a delight to him to work under Phayre, whose
    noble and lovable character he had already learned to appreciate two
    years before in Pegu. Then, too, Yule has spoken of the intense relief it
    was to escape from the monotonous scenery and depressing conditions of
    official life in Bengal (Resort to Simla was the exception, not the rule,
    in these days!) to the cheerfulness and unconstraint of Burma, with its
    fine landscapes and merry-hearted population. “It was such a relief to
    find natives who would laugh at a joke,” he once remarked in the writer’s
    presence to the lamented E. C. Baber, who replied that he had experienced
    exactly the same sense of relief in passing from India to China.</p>

  <p>Yule’s work on Burma was largely illustrated by his own sketches. One of
    these represents the King’s reception of the Embassy, and another, the
    King on his throne. The originals were executed by Yule’s ready pencil,
    surreptitiously within his cocked hat, during the audience.</p>

  <p>From the latter sketch Yule had a small oil-painting executed under his
    direction by a German artist, then resident in Calcutta, which he gave to
    Lord Dalhousie.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvi">xlvi</span></p>

  <p>The Government of India marked their approval of the Embassy by an unusual
    concession. Each of the members of the mission received a souvenir of the
    expedition. To Yule was given a very beautiful and elaborately chased small
    bowl, of nearly pure gold, bearing the signs of the Zodiac in relief.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

  <p>On his return to Calcutta, Yule threw himself heart and soul into the
    work of his new appointment in the Public Works Department. The nature of
    his work, the novelty and variety of the projects and problems with which
    this new branch of the service had to deal, brought Yule into constant,
    and eventually very intimate association with Lord Dalhousie, whom he
    accompanied on some of his tours of inspection. The two men thoroughly
    appreciated each other, and, from first to last, Yule experienced the
    greatest kindness from Lord Dalhousie. In this intimacy, no doubt the fact
    of being what French soldiers call <i lang="fr">pays</i> added something to the warmth
    of their mutual regard: their forefathers came from the same <em>airt</em>, and
    neither was unmindful of the circumstance. It is much to be regretted that
    Yule preserved no sketch of Lord Dalhousie, nor written record of his
    intercourse with him, but the following lines show some part of what he thought:</p>

  <p>“At this time [1849] there appears upon the scene that vigorous and
    masterful spirit, whose arrival to take up the government of India had
    been greeted by events so inauspicious. No doubt from the beginning the
    Governor-General was desirous to let it be understood that although new to
    India he was, and meant to be, master; ... Lord Dalhousie was by no means
    averse to frank dissent, provided <em>in the manner</em> it was never forgotten
    that he was Governor-General. Like his great predecessor Lord Wellesley, he
    was jealous of all familiarity and resented it.... The general sentiment
    of those who worked under that <span lang="el">ἄναξ ανδρῶν</span> was one of strong and
    admiring affection ... and we doubt if a Governor-General ever embarked on
    the Hoogly amid deeper feeling than attended him who, shattered by sorrow
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlvii">xlvii</span>physical suffering, but erect and undaunted, quitted Calcutta on the
    6th March 1856.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

  <p>His successor was Lord Canning, whose confidence in Yule and personal
    regard for him became as marked as his predecessor’s.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1856, Yule took leave and came home. Much of his time
    while in England was occupied with making arrangements for the production
    of an improved edition of his book on Burma, which so far had been a mere
    government report. These were completed to his satisfaction, and on the eve
    of returning to India, he wrote to his publishers<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> that the correction
    of the proof sheets and general supervision of the publication had been
    undertaken by his friend the Rev. W. D. Maclagan, formerly an officer of
    the Madras army (and now Archbishop of York).</p>

  <p>Whilst in England, Yule had renewed his intimacy with his old friend
    Colonel Robert Napier, then also on furlough, a visitor whose kindly
    sympathetic presence always brought special pleasure also to Yule’s wife
    and child. One result of this intercourse was that the friends decided to
    return together to India. Accordingly they sailed from Marseilles towards
    the end of April, and at Aden were met by the astounding news of the
    outbreak of the Mutiny.</p>

  <p>On his arrival in Calcutta Yule, who retained his appointment of Under
    Secretary to Government, found his work indefinitely increased. Every
    available officer was called into the field, and Yule’s principal centre
    of activity was shifted to the great fortress of Allahabad, forming
    the principal base of operations against the rebels. Not only had he
    to strengthen or create defences at Allahabad and elsewhere, but on
    Yule devolved the principal burden of improvising accommodation for the
    European troops then pouring into India, which ultimately meant providing
    for an army of 100,000 men. His task was made the more difficult by the
    long-standing chronic friction, then and long after, existing between the
    officers of the Queen’s and the Company’s services. But in a far more
    important matter he was always fortunate. As he subsequently recorded
    in a Note for Government: “Through all consciousness of mistakes and
    shortcomings, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlviii">xlviii</span>I have felt that I had the confidence of those whom I served,
    a feeling which has lightened many a weight.”</p>

  <p>It was at Allahabad that Yule, in the intervals of more serious work, put
    the last touches to his Burma book. The preface of the English edition
    is dated, “Fortress of Allahabad, Oct. 3, 1857,” and contains a passage
    instinct with the emotions of the time. After recalling the “joyous
    holiday” on the Irawady, he goes on: “But for ourselves, standing here on
    the margin of these rivers, which a few weeks ago were red with the blood
    of our murdered brothers and sisters, and straining the ear to catch the
    echo of our avenging artillery, it is difficult to turn the mind to what
    seem dreams of past days of peace and security; and memory itself grows dim
    in the attempt to repass the gulf which the last few months has interposed
    between the present and the time to which this narrative refers.”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

  <p>When he wrote these lines, the first relief had just taken place, and the
    second defence of Lucknow was beginning. The end of the month saw Sir
    Colin Campbell’s advance to the second—the real—relief of Lucknow. Of Sir
    Colin, Yule wrote and spoke with warm regard: “Sir Colin was delightful,
    and when in a good humour and at his best, always reminded me very much,
    both in manner and talk, of the General (<i>i.e.</i> General White, his wife’s
    father). The voice was just the same and the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xlix">xlix</span>quiet gentle manner, with its
    underlying keen dry humour. But then if you did happen to offend Sir Colin,
    it was like treading on crackers, which was not our General’s way.”</p>

  <p>When Lucknow had been relieved, besieged, reduced, and finally remodelled
    by the grand Roads and Demolitions Scheme of his friend Napier, the latter
    came down to Allahabad, and he and Yule sought diversion in playing quoits
    and skittles, the only occasion on which either of them is known to have
    evinced any liking for games.</p>

  <p>Before this time Yule had succeeded his friend Baker as <i lang="la">de facto</i>
    Secretary to Government for Public Works, and on Baker’s retirement in
    1858, Yule was formally appointed his successor.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Baker and Yule had,
    throughout their association, worked in perfect unison, and the very
    differences in their characters enhanced the value of their co-operation;
    the special qualities of each friend mutually strengthened and completed
    each other. Yule’s was by far the more original and creative mind,
    Baker’s the more precise and, at least in a professional sense, the more
    highly-trained organ. In chivalrous sense of honour, devotion to duty,
    and natural generosity, the men stood equal; but while Yule was by nature
    impatient and irritable, and liable, until long past middle age, to
    occasional sudden bursts of uncontrollable anger, generally followed by
    periods of black depression and almost absolute silence,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Baker was
    the very reverse. Partly by natural temperament, but also certainly by
    severe self-discipline, his manner was invincibly placid and his temper
    imperturbable.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Yet none was more tenacious in maintaining whatever he
    judged right.</p>

  <p>Baker, whilst large-minded in great matters, was extremely conventional
    in small ones, and Yule must sometimes have tried his feelings in this
    respect. The particulars of one such tragic occurrence have survived.
    Yule, who was colour-blind,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_l">l</span>early life whimsically obstinate in
    maintaining his own view of colours, had selected some cloth for trousers
    undeterred by his tailor’s timid remonstrance of “Not <em>quite</em> your usual
    taste, sir.” The result was that the Under-Secretary to Government startled
    official Calcutta by appearing in brilliant claret-coloured raiment. Baker
    remonstrated: “Claret-colour! Nonsense, my trousers are silver grey,” said
    Yule, and entirely declined to be convinced. “I think I <em>did</em> convince him
    at last,” said Baker with some pride, when long after telling the story
    to the present writer. “And <em>then</em> he gave them up?” “Oh, no,” said Sir
    William ruefully, “he wore those claret-coloured trousers to the very end.”
    That episode probably belonged to the Dalhousie period.</p>

  <p>When Yule resumed work in the Secretariat at Calcutta at the close of the
    Mutiny, the inevitable arrears of work were enormous. This may be the
    proper place to notice more fully his action with respect to the choice of
    gauge for Indian railways already adverted to in brief. As we have seen,
    his own convictions led to the adoption of the metre gauge over a great
    part of India. This policy had great disadvantages not at first foreseen,
    and has since been greatly modified. In justice to Yule, however, it should
    be remembered that the conditions and requirements of India have largely
    altered, alike through the extraordinary growth of the Indian export,
    especially the grain, trade, and the development of new necessities for
    Imperial defence. These new features, however, did but accentuate defects
    inherent in the system, but which only prolonged practical experience made
    fully apparent.</p>

  <p>At the outset the supporters of the narrow gauge seemed to have the
    stronger position, as they were able to show that the cost was much less,
    the rails employed being only about ⅔rds the weight of those required by
    the broad gauge, and many other subsidiary expenses also proportionally
    less. On the other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_li">li</span>hand, as time passed and practical experience was
    gained, its opponents were able to make an even stronger case against
    the narrow gauge. The initial expenses were undoubtedly less, but the
    durability was also less. Thus much of the original saving was lost in
    the greater cost of maintenance, whilst the small carrying capacity of
    the rolling stock and loss of time and labour in shifting goods at every
    break of gauge, were further serious causes of waste, which the internal
    commercial development of India daily made more apparent. Strategic
    needs also were clamant against the dangers of the narrow gauge in any
    general scheme of Indian defence. Yule’s connection with the Public Works
    Department had long ceased ere the question of the gauges reached its most
    acute stage, but his interest and indirect participation in the conflict
    survived. In this matter a certain parental tenderness for a scheme which
    he had helped to originate, combined with his warm friendship for some of
    the principal supporters of the narrow gauge, seem to have influenced his
    views more than he himself was aware. Certainly his judgment in this matter
    was not impartial, although, as always in his case, it was absolutely
    sincere and not consciously biased.</p>

  <p>In reference to Yule’s services in the period following the Mutiny, Lord
    Canning’s subsequent Minute of 1862 may here be fitly quoted. In this
    the Governor-General writes: “I have long ago recorded my opinion of the
    value of his services in 1858 and 1859, when with a crippled and overtaxed
    staff of Engineer officers, many of them young and inexperienced, the
    G.-G. had to provide rapidly for the accommodation of a vast English army,
    often in districts hitherto little known, and in which the authority of
    the Government was barely established, and always under circumstances of
    difficulty and urgency. I desire to repeat that the Queen’s army in India
    was then greatly indebted to Lieut.-Colonel Yule’s judgment, earnestness,
    and ability; and this to an extent very imperfectly understood by many of
    the officers who held commands in that army.</p>

  <p>“Of the manner in which the more usual duties of his office have been
    discharged it is unnecessary for me to speak. It is, I believe, known and
    appreciated as well by the Home Government as by the Governor-General in
    Council.”</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1859 Yule felt the urgent need of a rest, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lii">lii</span>took the, at
    that time, most unusual step of coming home on three months’ leave, which
    as the voyage then occupied a month each way, left him only one month at
    home. He was accompanied by his elder brother George, who had not been out
    of India for thirty years. The visit home of the two brothers was as bright
    and pleasant as it was brief, but does not call for further notice.</p>

  <p>In 1860, Yule’s health having again suffered, he took short leave to Java.
    His journal of this tour is very interesting, but space does not admit of
    quotation here. He embodied some of the results of his observations in a
    lecture he delivered on his return to Calcutta.</p>

  <p>During these latter years of his service in India, Yule owed much happiness
    to the appreciative friendship of Lord Canning and the ready sympathy
    of Lady Canning. If he shared their tours in an official capacity, the
    intercourse was much more than official. The noble character of Lady
    Canning won from Yule such wholehearted chivalrous devotion as, probably,
    he felt for no other friend save, perhaps in after days, Sir Bartle Frere.
    And when her health failed, it was to Yule’s special care that Lord Canning
    entrusted his wife during a tour in the Hills. Lady Canning was known to
    be very homesick, and one day as the party came in sight of some ilexes
    (the evergreen oak), Yule sought to cheer her by calling out pleasantly:
    “Look, Lady Canning! There are <em>oaks</em>!” “No, no, Yule, <em>not</em> oaks,” cried
    Sir C. B. “They are (solemnly) <span class="smcap">Ibexes</span>.” “No, <em>not</em> Ibexes, Sir C., you
    mean <span class="smcap">Silexes</span>,” cried Capt. ——, the A.D.C.; Lady Canning and Yule the while
    almost choking with laughter.</p>

  <p>On another and later occasion, when the Governor-General’s camp was
    peculiarly dull and stagnant, every one yawning and grumbling, Yule
    effected a temporary diversion by pretending to tap the telegraph wires,
    and circulating through camp, what purported to be, the usual telegraphic
    abstract of news brought to Bombay by the latest English mail. The news
    was of the most astounding character, with just enough air of probability,
    in minor details, to pass muster with a dull reader. The effect was all he
    could wish—or rather more—and there was a general flutter in the camp. Of
    course the Governor-General and one or two others were in the secret, and
    mightily relished the diversion. But this pleasant and cheering intercourse
    was drawing to its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_liii">liii</span>mournful close. On her way back from Darjeeling, in
    November, 1861, Lady Canning (not then in Yule’s care) was unavoidably
    exposed to the malaria of a specially unhealthy season. A few days’ illness
    followed, and on 18th November, 1861, she passed calmly to</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“That remaining rest where night and tears are o’er.”<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It was to Yule that Lord Canning turned in the first anguish of his loss,
    and on this faithful friend devolved the sad privilege of preparing
    her last resting-place. This may be told in the touching words of Lord
    Canning’s letter to his only sister, written on the day of Lady Canning’s
    burial, in the private garden at Barrackpoor<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>:—</p>

  <p>“The funeral is over, and my own darling lies buried in a spot which I am
    sure she would have chosen of all others.... From the grave can be seen
    the embanked walk leading from the house to the river’s edge, which she
    made as a landing-place three years ago, and from within 3 or 4 paces of
    the grave there is a glimpse of the terrace-garden and its balustrades,
    which she made near the house, and of the part of the grounds with which
    she most occupied herself.... I left Calcutta yesterday ... and on arriving
    here, went to look at the precise spot chosen for the grave. I could see
    by the clear full moon ... that it was exactly right. Yule was there
    superintending the workmen, and before daylight this morning a solid
    masonry vault had been completely finished.</p>

  <p>“Bowie [Military Secretary] and Yule have done all this for me. It has
    all been settled since my poor darling died. She liked Yule. They used to
    discuss together her projects of improvement for this place, architecture,
    gardening, the Cawnpore monument, etc., and they generally agreed. He knew
    her tastes well....”</p>

  <p>The coffin, brought on a gun-carriage from Calcutta, “was carried by twelve
    soldiers of the 6th Regiment (Queen’s), the A.D.C.’s bearing the pall.
    There were no hired men or ordinary funeral attendants of any kind at any
    part of the ceremony, and no lookers-on.... Yule was the only person not of
    the household <span class="pagenum" id="Page_liv">liv</span>staff. Had others who had asked” to attend “been allowed to
    do so, the numbers would have been far too large.</p>

  <p>“On coming near the end of the terrace walk I saw that the turf between the
    walk and the grave, and for several yards all round the grave, was strewed
    thick with palm branches and bright fresh-gathered flowers—quite a thick
    carpet. It was a little matter, but so exactly what she would have thought
    of.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

  <p>And, therefore, Yule thought of this for her! He also recorded the scene
    two days later in some graceful and touching lines, privately printed, from
    which the following may be quoted:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“When night lowered black, and the circling shroud</div>
        <div class="i1">Of storm rolled near, and stout hearts learned dismay;</div>
        <div class="i1">Not Hers! To her tried Lord a Light and Stay</div>
        <div class="i1">Even in the Earthquake and the palpable cloud</div>
        <div class="i1">Of those dark months; and when a fickle crowd</div>
        <div class="i1">Panted for blood and pelted wrath and scorn</div>
        <div class="i1">On him she loved, her courage never stooped:</div>
        <div class="i1">But when the clouds were driven, and the day</div>
        <div class="i1">Poured Hope and glorious Sunshine, she who had borne,</div>
        <div class="i1">The night with such strong Heart, withered and drooped,</div>
        <div class="i1">Our queenly lily, and smiling passed away.</div>
        <div class="i1">Now! let no fouling touch profane her clay,</div>
        <div class="i1">Nor odious pomps and funeral tinsels mar</div>
        <div class="i1">Our grief. But from our England’s cannon car</div>
        <div class="i1">Let England’s soldiers bear her to the tomb</div>
        <div class="i1">Prepared by loving hands. Before her bier</div>
        <div class="i1">Scatter victorious palms; let Rose’s bloom</div>
        <div class="i1">Carpet its passage....”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Yule’s deep sympathy in this time of sorrow strengthened the friendship
    Lord Canning had long felt for him, and when the time approached for the
    Governor-General to vacate his high office, he invited Yule, who was very
    weary of India, to accompany him home, where his influence would secure
    Yule congenial employment. Yule’s weariness of India at this time was
    extreme. Moreover, after serving under such leaders as Lord Dalhousie
    and Lord Canning, and winning their full confidence and friendship, it
    was almost repugnant to him to begin afresh with new men and probably
    new measures, with which he might <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lv">lv</span>not be in accord. Indeed, some little
    clouds were already visible on the horizon. In these circumstances, it is
    not surprising that Yule, under an impulse of lassitude and impatience,
    when accepting Lord Canning’s offer, also ‘burnt his boats’ by sending
    in his resignation of the service. This decision Yule took against the
    earnest advice of his anxious and devoted wife, and for a time the results
    justified all her misgivings. She knew well, from past experience, how
    soon Yule wearied in the absence of compulsory employment. And in the
    event of the life in England not suiting him, for even Lord Canning’s
    good-will might not secure perfectly congenial employment for his talents,
    she knew well that his health and spirits would be seriously affected.
    She, therefore, with affectionate solicitude, urged that he should adopt
    the course previously followed by his friend Baker, that is, come home on
    furlough, and only send in his resignation after he saw clearly what his
    prospects of home employment were, and what he himself wished in the matter.</p>

  <p>Lord Canning and Yule left Calcutta late in March, 1862; at Malta they
    parted never to meet again in this world. Lord Canning proceeded to
    England, and Yule joined his wife and child in Rome. Only a few weeks
    later, at Florence, came as a thunderclap the announcement of Lord
    Canning’s unexpected death in London, on 17th June. Well does the present
    writer remember the day that fatal news came, and Yule’s deep anguish,
    not assuredly for the loss of his prospects, but for the loss of a most
    noble and magnanimous friend, a statesman whose true greatness was, both
    then and since, most imperfectly realised by the country for which he had
    worn himself out.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Shortly after Yule went
    to England,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> where he
    was cordially received by Lord Canning’s representatives, who gave him
    a touching remembrance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvi">lvi</span>of his lost friend, in the shape of the silver
    travelling candlesticks, which had habitually stood on Lord Canning’s
    writing-table.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But his offer to write Lord Canning’s <cite>Life</cite> had no
    result, as the relatives, following the then recent example of the Hastings
    family, in the case of another great Governor-General, refused to revive
    discussion by the publication of any Memoir.</p>

  <p>Nor did Yule find any suitable opening for employment in England, so after
    two or three months spent in visiting old friends, he rejoined his family
    in the Black Forest, where he sought occupation in renewing his knowledge
    of German. But it must be confessed that his mood both then and for long
    after was neither happy nor wholesome. The winter of 1862 was spent
    somewhat listlessly, partly in Germany and partly at the Hôtel des Bergues,
    Geneva, where his old acquaintance Colonel Tronchin was hospitably ready to
    open all doors. The picturesque figure of John Ruskin also flits across the
    scene at this time. But Yule was unoccupied and restless, and could neither
    enjoy Mr. Ruskin’s criticism of his sketches nor the kindly hospitality
    of his Genevan hosts. Early in 1863 he made another fruitless visit to
    London, where he remained four or five months, but found no opening. Though
    unproductive of work, this year brought Yule official recognition of his
    services in the shape of the C.B., for which Lord Canning had long before
    recommended him.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

  <p>On rejoining his wife and child at Mornex in Savoy, Yule found the health
    of the former seriously impaired. During his absence, the kind and able
    English Doctor at Geneva had felt obliged to inform Mrs. Yule that she was
    suffering from disease of the heart, and that her life might end suddenly
    at any moment. Unwilling to add to Yule’s anxieties, she made all necessary
    arrangements, but did not communicate this intelligence until he had done
    all he wished and returned, when she broke it to him very gently. Up to
    this year Mrs. Yule, though not strong and often ailing, had not allowed
    herself to be considered <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lvii">lvii</span>an invalid, but from this date doctor’s orders
    left her no choice in the matter.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

  <p>About this time, Yule took in hand the first of his studies of mediæval
    travellers. His translation of the <cite>Travels of Friar Jordanus</cite> was
    probably commenced earlier; it was completed during the leisurely journey
    by carriage between Chambéry and Turin, and the Dedication to Sir Bartle
    Frere written during a brief halt at Genoa, from which place it is dated.
    Travelling slowly and pleasantly by <i lang="it">vetturino</i> along the Riviera di
    Levante, the family came to Spezzia, then little more than a quiet village.
    A chance encounter with agreeable residents disposed Yule favourably
    towards the place, and a few days later he opened negotiations for land
    to build a house! Most fortunately for himself and all concerned these
    fell through, and the family continued their journey to Tuscany, and
    settled for the winter in a long rambling house, with pleasant garden, at
    Pisa, where Yule was able to continue with advantage his researches into
    mediæval travel in the East. He paid frequent visits to Florence, where
    he had many pleasant acquaintances, not least among them Charles Lever
    (“Harry Lorrequer”), with whom acquaintance ripened into warm and enduring
    friendship. At Florence he also made the acquaintance of the celebrated
    Marchese Gino Capponi, and of many other Italian men of letters. To this
    winter of 1863–64 belongs also the commencement of a lasting friendship
    with the illustrious Italian historian, Villari, at that time holding an
    appointment at Pisa. Another agreeable acquaintance, though less intimate,
    was formed with John Ball, the well-known President of the Alpine Club,
    then resident at Pisa, and with many others, among whom the name of a very
    cultivated German scholar, H. Meyer, specially recurs to memory.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lviii">lviii</span></p>

  <p>In the spring of 1864, Yule took a spacious and delightful old villa,
    situated in the highest part of the Bagni di Lucca,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and commanding
    lovely views over the surrounding chestnut-clad hills and winding river.</p>

  <p>Here he wrote much of what ultimately took form in <cite>Cathay and the Way
    Thither</cite>. It was this summer, too, that Yule commenced his investigations
    among the Venetian archives, and also visited the province of Friuli
    in pursuit of materials for the history of one of his old travellers,
    the <cite>Beato Odorico</cite>. At Verona—then still Austrian—he had the amusing
    experience of being arrested for sketching too near the fortifications.
    However, his captors had all the usual Austrian <i lang="fr">bonhomie</i> and courtesy,
    and Yule experienced no real inconvenience. He was much more disturbed
    when, a day or two later, the old mother of one of his Venetian
    acquaintances insisted on embracing him on account of his supposed likeness
    to Garibaldi!</p>

  <p>As winter approached, a warmer climate became necessary for Mrs. Yule, and
    the family proceeded to Sicily, landing at Messina in October, 1864. From
    this point, Yule made a very interesting excursion to the then little known
    group of the Lipari Islands, in the company of that eminent geologist, the
    late Robert Mallet, F.R.S., a most agreeable companion.</p>

  <p>On Martinmas Day, the Yules reached the beautiful capital of Sicily,
    Palermo, which, though they knew it not, was to be their home—a very happy
    one—for nearly eleven years.</p>

  <p>During the ensuing winter and spring, Yule continued the preparation of
    <cite>Cathay</cite>, but his appetite for work not being satisfied by this, he, when
    in London in 1865, volunteered to make an Index to the third decade of
    the <cite>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</cite>, in exchange for a set of
    such volumes as he did not possess. That was long before any Index Society
    existed; but Yule had special and very strong views of his own as to what
    an Index should be, and he spared no labour to realise his ideal.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> This
    proved a heavier task than he had anticipated, and he got very weary before
    the Index was completed.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lix">lix</span></p>

  <p>In the spring of 1866, <cite>Cathay and the Way Thither</cite> appeared, and at once
    took the high place which it has ever since retained. In the autumn of
    the same year Yule’s attention was momentarily turned in a very different
    direction by a local insurrection, followed by severe reprisals, and
    the bombardment of Palermo by the Italian Fleet. His sick wife was for
    some time under rifle as well as shell fire; but cheerfully remarking
    that “every bullet has its billet,” she remained perfectly serene and
    undisturbed. It was the year of the last war with Austria, and also of the
    suppression of the Monastic Orders in Sicily; two events which probably
    helped to produce the outbreak, of which Yule contributed an account
    to <cite>The Times</cite>, and subsequently a more detailed one to the <cite>Quarterly
    Review</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

  <p>Yule had no more predilection for the Monastic Orders than most of his
    countrymen, but his sense of justice was shocked by the cruel incidence of
    the measure in many cases, and also by the harshness with which both it
    and the punishment of suspected insurgents was carried out. Cholera was
    prevalent in Italy that year, but Sicily, which had maintained stringent
    quarantine, entirely escaped until large bodies of troops were landed to
    quell the insurrection, when a devastating epidemic immediately ensued,
    and re-appeared in 1867. In after years, when serving on the Army Sanitary
    Committee at the India Office, Yule more than once quoted this experience
    as indicating that quarantine restrictions may, in some cases, have more
    value than British medical authority is usually willing to admit.</p>

  <p>In 1867, on his return from London, Yule commenced systematic work on
    his long projected new edition of the <cite>Travels of Marco Polo</cite>. It was
    apparently in this year that the scheme first took definite form, but
    it had long been latent in his mind. The Public Libraries of Palermo
    afforded him much good material, whilst occasional visits to the Libraries
    of Venice, Florence, Paris, and London, opened other sources. But his
    most important channel of supply came from his very extensive private
    correspondence, extending to nearly all parts of Europe and many centres
    in Asia. His work brought him many new and valued friends, indeed too many
    to mention, but amongst whom, as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lx">lx</span>belonging specially to this period, three
    honoured names must be recalled here: Commendatore (afterwards Baron)
    <span class="smcap">Cristoforo Negri</span>, the large-hearted Founder and First President of the
    Geographical Society of Italy, from whom Yule received his first public
    recognition as a geographer, Commendatore <span class="smcap">Guglielmo Berchet</span> (affectionately
    nicknamed <cite>il Bello e Buono</cite>), ever generous in learned help, who became a
    most dear and honoured friend, and the Hon. <span class="smcap">George P. Marsh</span>, U.S. Envoy to
    the Court of Italy, a man, both as scholar and friend, unequalled in his
    nation, perhaps almost unique anywhere.</p>

  <p>Those who only knew Yule in later years, may like some account of his daily
    life at this time. It was his custom to rise fairly early; in summer he
    sometimes went to bathe in the sea,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> or for a walk before breakfast;
    more usually he would write until breakfast, which he preferred to have
    alone. After breakfast he looked through his notebooks, and before ten
    o’clock was usually walking rapidly to the library where his work lay. He
    would work there until two or three o’clock, when he returned home, read
    the <cite>Times</cite>, answered letters, received or paid visits, and then resumed
    work on his book, which he often continued long after the rest of the
    household were sleeping. Of course his family saw but little of him under
    these circumstances, but when he had got a chapter of <cite>Marco</cite> into shape,
    or struck out some new discovery of interest, he would carry it to his wife
    to read. She always took great interest in his work, and he had great faith
    in her literary instinct as a sound as well as sympathetic critic.</p>

  <p>The first fruits of Yule’s Polo studies took the form of a review of
    Pauthier’s edition of <cite>Marco Polo</cite>, contributed to the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite>
    in 1868.</p>

  <p>In 1870 the great work itself appeared, and received prompt generous
    recognition by the grant of the very beautiful gold medal of the
    Geographical Society of Italy,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> followed in 1872 by the award of the
    Founder’s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, while the Geographical
    and Asiatic Societies of Paris, the Geographical Societies of Italy and
    Berlin, the Academy of Bologna, and other learned bodies, enrolled him as
    an Honorary Member.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxi">lxi</span></p>

  <p>Reverting to 1869, we may note that Yule, when passing through Paris early
    in the spring, became acquainted, through his friend M. Charles Maunoir,
    with the admirable work of exploration lately performed by Lieut. Francis
    Garnier of the French Navy. It was a time of much political excitement in
    France, the eve of the famous <i lang="fr">Plébiscite</i>, and the importance of Garnier’s
    work was not then recognised by his countrymen. Yule saw its value, and
    on arrival in London went straight to Sir Roderick Murchison, laid the
    facts before him, and suggested that no other traveller of the year had so
    good a claim to one of the two gold medals of the R.G.S. as this French
    naval Lieutenant. Sir Roderick was propitious, and accordingly in May
    the Patron’s medal was assigned to Garnier, who was touchingly grateful
    to Yule; whilst the French Minister of Marine marked his appreciation
    of Yule’s good offices by presenting him with the magnificent volumes
    commemorating the expedition.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

  <p>Yule was in Paris in 1871, immediately after the suppression of the
    Commune, and his letters gave interesting accounts of the extraordinary
    state of affairs then prevailing. In August, he served as President of the
    Geographical Section of the British Association at its Edinburgh meeting.</p>

  <p>On his return to Palermo, he devoted himself specially to the geography
    of the Oxus region, and the result appeared next year in his introduction
    and notes to Wood’s <cite>Journey</cite>. Soon after his return to Palermo, he
    became greatly interested in the plans, about which he was consulted,
    of an English church, the gift to the English community of two of its
    oldest members, Messrs Ingham and Whitaker. Yule’s share in the enterprise
    gradually expanded, until he became a sort of volunteer clerk of the
    works, to the great benefit of his health, as this occupation during the
    next three years, whilst adding to his interests, also kept him longer
    in the open air than would otherwise have been the case. It was a real
    misfortune to Yule (and one of which he was himself at times conscious)
    that he had no taste for any out-of-door pursuits, neither for any form of
    natural science, nor for gardening, nor for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxii">lxii</span>any kind of sport nor games.
    Nor did he willingly ride.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
    He was always restless away from his books.
    There can be no doubt that want of sufficient air and exercise, reacting
    on an impaired liver, had much to do with Yule’s unsatisfactory state of
    health and frequent extreme depression. There was no lack of agreeable and
    intelligent society at Palermo (society that the present writer recalls
    with cordial regard), to which every winter brought pleasant temporary
    additions, both English and foreign, the best of whom generally sought
    Yule’s acquaintance. Old friends too were not wanting; many found their way
    to Palermo, and when such came, he was willing to show them hospitality and
    to take them excursions, and occasionally enjoyed these. But though the
    beautiful city and surrounding country were full of charm and interest,
    Yule was too much pre-occupied by his own special engrossing pursuits ever
    really to get the good of his surroundings, of which indeed he often seemed
    only half conscious.</p>

  <p>By this time Yule had obtained, without ever having sought it, a distinct
    and, in some respects, quite unique position in geographical science.
    Although his <cite>Essay on the Geography of the Oxus Region</cite> (1872) received
    comparatively little public attention at home, it had yet made its mark
    once for all,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and from this time, if not earlier, Yule’s high authority
    in all questions of Central Asian geography was generally recognised. He
    had long ere this, almost unconsciously, laid the broad foundations of that
    “Yule method,” of which Baron von Richthofen has written so eloquently,
    declaring that not only in his own land, “but also in the literatures of
    France, Italy, Germany, and other countries, the powerful stimulating
    influence of the Yule method is visible.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> More than one writer has
    indeed boldly compared <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxiii">lxiii</span>Central Asia before Yule to Central Africa before
    Livingstone!</p>

  <p>Yule had wrought from sheer love of the work and without expectation of
    public recognition, and it was therefore a great surprise as well as
    gratification to him, to find that the demand for his <cite>Marco Polo</cite> was
    such as to justify the appearance of a second edition only a few years
    after the first. The preparation of this enlarged edition, with much other
    miscellaneous work (see subjoined bibliography), and the superintendence of
    the building of the church already named, kept him fully occupied for the
    next three years.</p>

  <p>Amongst the parerga and miscellaneous occupations of Yule’s leisure hours
    in the period 1869–74, may be mentioned an interesting correspondence
    with Professor W. W. Skeat on the subject of <cite>William of Palerne</cite> and
    Sicilian examples of the Werwolf; the skilful analysis and exposure of
    Klaproth’s false geography;<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> the purchase and despatch of Sicilian
    seeds and young trees for use in the Punjab, at the request of the Indian
    Forestry Department; translations (prepared for friends) of tracts on the
    cultivation of Sumach and the collection of Manna as practised in Sicily;
    also a number of small services rendered to the South Kensington Museum,
    at the request of the late Sir Henry Cole. These latter included obtaining
    Italian and Sicilian bibliographic contributions to the Science and Art
    Department’s <cite>Catalogue of Books on Art</cite>, selecting architectural subjects
    to be photographed;<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> negotiating the purchase of the original drawings
    illustrative of Padre B. Gravina’s great work on the Cathedral of Monreale;
    and superintending the execution of a copy in mosaic of the large mosaic
    picture (in the Norman Palatine Chapel, Palermo,) of the Entry of our Lord
    into Jerusalem.</p>

  <p>In the spring of 1875, just after the publication of the second <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxiv">lxiv</span>edition of
    <cite>Marco Polo</cite>, Yule had to mourn the loss of his noble wife. He was absent
    from Sicily at the time, but returned a few hours after her death on 30th
    April. She had suffered for many years from a severe form of heart disease,
    but her end was perfect peace. She was laid to rest, amid touching tokens
    of both public and private sympathy, in the beautiful camposanto on Monte
    Pellegrino. What her loss was to Yule only his oldest and closest friends
    were in a position to realise. Long years of suffering had impaired neither
    the soundness of her judgment nor the sweetness, and even gaiety, of her
    happy, unselfish disposition. And in spirit, as even in appearance, she
    retained to the very last much of the radiance of her youth. Nor were her
    intellectual gifts less remarkable. Few who had once conversed with her
    ever forgot her, and certainly no one who had once known her intimately
    ever ceased to love her.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

  <p>Shortly after this calamity, Yule removed to London, and on the retirement
    of his old friend, Sir William Baker, from the India Council early that
    autumn, Lord Salisbury at once selected him for the vacant seat. Nothing
    would ever have made him a party-man, but he always followed Lord Salisbury
    with conviction, and worked under him with steady confidence.</p>

  <p>In 1877 Yule married, as his second wife, the daughter of an old
    friend,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> a very amiable woman twenty years his junior, who made him
    very happy until her untimely death in 1881. From the time of his joining
    the India Council, his duties at the India Office of course occupied a
    great part of his time, but he also continued to do an immense amount of
    miscellaneous literary work, as may be seen by reference to the subjoined
    bibliography, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxv">lxv</span>(itself probably incomplete). In Council he invariably
    “showed his strong determination to endeavour to deal with questions
    on their own merits and not only by custom and precedent.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Amongst
    subjects in which he took a strong line of his own in the discussions of
    the Council, may be specially instanced his action in the matter of the
    cotton duties (in which he defended native Indian manufactures as against
    hostile Manchester interests); the Vernacular Press Act, the necessity
    for which he fully recognised; and the retention of Kandahar, for which
    he recorded his vote in a strong minute. In all these three cases, which
    are typical of many others, his opinion was overruled, but having been
    carefully and deliberately formed, it remained unaffected by defeat.</p>

  <p>In all matters connected with Central Asian affairs, Yule’s opinion
    always carried great weight; some of his most competent colleagues
    indeed preferred his authority in this field to that of even Sir Henry
    Rawlinson, possibly for the reason given by Sir M. Grant Duff, who has
    epigrammatically described the latter as good in Council but dangerous in
    counsel.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

  <p>Yule’s courageous independence and habit of looking at all public questions
    by the simple light of what appeared to him right, yet without fads or
    doctrinairism, earned for him the respect of the successive Secretaries of
    State under whom he served, and the warm regard and confidence of his other
    colleagues. The value attached to his services in Council was sufficiently
    shown by the fact that when the period of ten years (for which members
    are usually appointed), was about to expire, Lord Hartington (now Duke of
    Devonshire), caused Yule’s appointment to be renewed for life, under a
    special Act of Parliament passed for this purpose in 1885.</p>

  <p>His work as a member of the Army Sanitary Committee, brought him into
    communication with Miss Florence Nightingale, a privilege which he greatly
    valued and enjoyed, though he used to say: “She is worse than a Royal
    Commission to answer, and, in the most gracious charming manner possible,
    immediately finds out all I don’t know!” Indeed his devotion to the
    “Lady-in-Chief” was scarcely less complete than Kinglake’s.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxvi">lxvi</span></p>

  <p>In 1880, Yule was appointed to the Board of Visitors of the Government
    Indian Engineering College at Cooper’s Hill, a post which added to his
    sphere of interests without materially increasing his work. In 1882, he
    was much gratified by being named an Honorary Fellow of the Society of
    Antiquaries of Scotland, more especially as it was to fill one of the two
    vacancies created by the deaths of Thomas Carlyle and Dean Stanley.</p>

  <p>Yule had been President of the Hakluyt Society from 1877, and in 1885 was
    elected President also of the Royal Asiatic Society. He would probably also
    have been President of the Royal Geographical Society, but for an untoward
    incident. Mention has already been made of his constant determination
    to judge all questions by the simple touchstone of what he believed to
    be right, irrespective of personal considerations. It was in pursuance
    of these principles that, at the cost of great pain to himself and some
    misrepresentation, he in 1878 sundered his long connection with the Royal
    Geographical Society, by resigning his seat on their Council, solely in
    consequence of their adoption of what he considered a wrong policy. This
    severance occurred just when it was intended to propose him as President.
    Some years later, at the personal request of the late Lord Aberdare, a
    President in all respects worthy of the best traditions of that great
    Society, Yule consented to rejoin the Council, which he re-entered as a
    Vice-President.</p>

  <p>In 1883, the University of Edinburgh celebrated its Tercentenary, when Yule
    was selected as one of the recipients of the honorary degree of LL.D. His
    letters from Edinburgh, on this occasion, give a very pleasant and amusing
    account of the festivity and of the celebrities he met. Nor did he omit to
    chronicle the envious glances cast, as he alleged, by some British men of
    science on the splendours of foreign Academic attire, on the yellow robes
    of the Sorbonne, and the Palms of the Institute of France! Pasteur was, he
    wrote, the one most enthusiastically acclaimed of all who received degrees.</p>

  <p>I think it was about the same time that M. Renan was in England, and called
    upon Sir Henry Maine, Yule, and others at the India Office. On meeting
    just after, the colleagues compared notes as to their distinguished but
    unwieldy visitor. “It seems that <i lang="fr">le style n’est pas l’homme même</i> in
    <em>this</em> instance,” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxvii">lxvii</span>quoth “Ancient Law” to “Marco Polo.” And here it may be
    remarked that Yule so completely identified himself with his favourite
    traveller that he frequently signed contributions to the public press as
    <span class="smcap">Marcus Paulus Venetus</span> or M.P.V. His more intimate friends also gave him the
    same <i lang="fr">sobriquet</i>, and once, when calling on his old friend, Dr. John Brown
    (the beloved chronicler of <cite>Rab and his Friends</cite>), he was introduced by
    Dr. John to some lion-hunting American visitors as “our Marco Polo.” The
    visitors evidently took the statement in a literal sense, and scrutinised
    Yule closely.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

  <p>In 1886 Yule published his delightful <cite>Anglo-Indian Glossary</cite>, with the
    whimsical but felicitous sub-title of <cite>Hobson-Jobson</cite> (the name given by
    the rank and file of the British Army in India to the religious festival in
    celebration of Hassan and Husaïn).</p>

  <p>This <cite>Glossary</cite> was an abiding interest to both Yule and the present
    writer. Contributions of illustrative quotations came from most diverse and
    unexpected sources, and the arrival of each new word or happy quotation was
    quite an event, and gave such pleasure to the recipients as can only be
    fully understood by those who have shared in such pursuits. The volume was
    dedicated in affecting terms to his elder brother, Sir George Yule, who,
    unhappily, did not survive to see it completed.</p>

  <p>In July 1885, the two brothers had taken the last of many happy journeys
    together, proceeding to Cornwall and the Scilly Isles. A few months later,
    on 13th January 1886, the end came suddenly to the elder, from the effects
    of an accident at his own door.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

  <p>It may be doubted if Yule ever really got over the shock of this loss,
    though he went on with his work as usual, and served that year as a Royal
    Commissioner on the occasion of the Indian and Colonial Exhibition of 1886.</p>

  <p>From 1878, when an accidental chill laid the foundations of an exhausting,
    though happily quite painless, malady, Yule’s strength had gradually
    failed, although for several years longer his general health and energies
    still appeared unimpaired to a casual observer. The condition of public
    affairs also, in some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxviii">lxviii</span>degree, affected his health injuriously. The general
    trend of political events from 1880 to 1886 caused him deep anxiety and
    distress, and his righteous wrath at what he considered the betrayal of his
    country’s honour in the cases of Frere, of Gordon, and of Ireland, found
    strong, and, in a noble sense, passionate expression in both prose and
    verse. He was never in any sense a party man, but he often called himself
    “one of Mr. Gladstone’s converts,” <i>i.e.</i> one whom Gladstonian methods had
    compelled to break with liberal tradition and prepossessions.</p>

  <p>Nothing better expresses Yule’s feeling in the period referred to than the
    following letter, written in reference to the R. E. Gordon Memorial,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
    but of much wider application: “Will you allow me an inch or two of space
    to say to my brother officers, ‘Have nothing to do with the proposed Gordon
    Memorial.’</p>

  <p>“That glorious memory is in no danger of perishing and needs no memorial.
    Sackcloth and silence are what it suggests to those who have guided the
    action of England; and Englishmen must bear the responsibility for that
    action and share its shame. It is too early for atoning memorials; nor is
    it possible for those who take part in them to dissociate themselves from a
    repulsive hypocrisy.</p>

  <p>“Let every one who would fain bestow something in honour of the great
    victim, do, in silence, some act of help to our soldiers or their families,
    or to others who are poor and suffering.</p>

  <p>“In later days our survivors or successors may look back with softened
    sorrow and pride to the part which men of our corps have played in these
    passing events, and Charles Gordon far in the front of all; and then they
    may set up our little tablets, or what not—not to preserve the memory
    of our heroes, but to maintain the integrity of our own record of the
    illustrious dead.”</p>

  <p>Happily Yule lived to see the beginning of better times for his country.
    One of the first indications of that national awakening was the right
    spirit in which the public, for the most part, received Lord Wolseley’s
    stirring appeal at the close of 1888, and Yule was so much struck by the
    parallelism between Lord Wolseley’s warning and some words of his own
    contained <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxix">lxix</span>in the pseudo-Polo fragment (see above, end of Preface), that he
    sent Lord Wolseley the very last copy of the 1875 edition of <cite>Marco Polo</cite>,
    with a vigorous expression of his sentiments.</p>

  <p>That was probably Yule’s last utterance on a public question. The sands
    of life were now running low, and in the spring of 1889, he felt it right
    to resign his seat on the India Council, to which he had been appointed
    for life. On this occasion Lord Cross, then Secretary of State for India,
    successfully urged his acceptance of the K.C.S.I., which Yule had refused
    several years before.</p>

  <p>In the House of Lords, Viscount Cross subsequently referred to his
    resignation in the following terms. He said: “A vacancy on the Council
    had unfortunately occurred through the resignation from ill-health of Sir
    Henry Yule, whose presence on the Council had been of enormous advantage
    to the natives of the country. A man of more kindly disposition, thorough
    intelligence, high-minded, upright, honourable character, he believed did
    not exist; and he would like to bear testimony to the estimation in which
    he was held, and to the services which he had rendered in the office he had
    so long filled.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

  <p>This year the Hakluyt Society published the concluding volume of Yule’s
    last work of importance, the <cite>Diary of Sir William Hedges</cite>. He had for
    several years been collecting materials for a full memoir of his great
    predecessor in the domain of historical geography, the illustrious
    Rennell.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> This work was well advanced as to preliminaries, but was
    not sufficiently developed for early publication at the time of Yule’s
    death, and ere it could be completed its place had been taken by a later
    enterprise.</p>

  <p>During the summer of 1889, Yule occupied much of his leisure by collecting
    and revising for re-issue many of his miscellaneous writings. Although
    not able to do much at a time, this desultory work kept him occupied
    and interested, and gave him much pleasure during many months. It was,
    however, never completed. Yule went to the seaside for a few weeks <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxx">lxx</span>in
    the early summer, and subsequently many pleasant days were spent by him
    among the Surrey hills, as the guest of his old friends Sir Joseph and
    Lady Hooker. Of their constant and unwearied kindness, he always spoke
    with most affectionate gratitude. That autumn he took a great dislike to
    the English climate; he hankered after sunshine, and formed many plans,
    eager though indefinite, for wintering at Cintra, a place whose perfect
    beauty had fascinated him in early youth. But increasing weakness made
    a journey to Portugal, or even the South of France, an alternative of
    which he also spoke, very inexpedient, if not absolutely impracticable.
    Moreover, he would certainly have missed abroad the many friends and
    multifarious interests which still surrounded him at home. He continued
    to take drives, and occasionally called on friends, up to the end of
    November, and it was not until the middle of December that increasing
    weakness obliged him to take to his bed. He was still, however, able to
    enjoy seeing his friends—some to the very end, and he had a constant stream
    of visitors, mostly old friends, but also a few newer ones, who were
    scarcely less welcome. He also kept up his correspondence to the last,
    three attached brother R.E.’s, General Collinson, General Maclagan, and
    Major W. Broadfoot, taking it in turn with the present writer to act as his
    amanuensis.</p>

  <p>On Friday, 27th December, Yule received a telegram from Paris, announcing
    his nomination that day as Corresponding Member of the Institute of France
    (Académie des Inscriptions), one of the few distinctions of any kind of
    which it can still be said that it has at no time lost any of its exalted dignity.</p>

  <p>An honour of a different kind that came about the same time, and was
    scarcely less prized by him, was a very beautiful letter of farewell and
    benediction from Miss Florence Nightingale,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> which he kept under his
    pillow and read many times. On the 28th, he dictated to the present writer
    his acknowledgment, also by telegraph, of the great honour done him by
    the Institute. The message was in the following words: “Reddo gratias,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxi">lxxi</span>Illustrissimi Domini, ob honores tanto nimios quanto immeritos! Mihi robora
    deficiunt, vita collabitur, accipiatis voluntatem pro facto. Cum corde
    pleno et gratissimo moriturus vos, Illustrissimi Domini, saluto. <span class="fright mr5"><span class="smcap">Yule</span>.”</span></p>

  <p>Sunday, 29th December, was a day of the most dense black fog, and he felt
    its oppression, but was much cheered by a visit from his ever faithful
    friend, Collinson, who, with his usual unselfishness, came to him that day
    at very great personal inconvenience.</p>

  <p>On Monday, 30th December, the day was clearer, and Henry Yule awoke much
    refreshed, and in a peculiarly happy and even cheerful frame of mind. He
    said he felt so comfortable. He spoke of his intended book, and bade his
    daughter write about the inevitable delay to his publisher: “Go and write
    to John Murray,” were indeed his last words to her. During the morning
    he saw some friends and relations, but as noon approached his strength
    flagged, and after a period of unconsciousness, he passed peacefully away
    in the presence of his daughter and of an old friend, who had come from
    Edinburgh to see him, but arrived too late for recognition. Almost at the
    same time that Yule fell asleep, his “stately message,”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> was being read
    under the great Dome in Paris. Some two hours after Yule had passed away,
    F.-M. Lord Napier of Magdala, called on an errand of friendship, and at his
    desire was admitted to see the last of his early friend. When Lord Napier
    came out, he said to the present writer, in his own reflective way: “He
    looks as if he had just settled to some great work.” With these suggestive
    words of the great soldier, who was so soon, alas, to follow his old friend
    to the work of another world, this sketch may fitly close.</p>

  <p>The same idea had been previously embodied, in very felicitous language, by
    the late General Sir William Lockhart, in a letter which that noble soldier
    addressed to the present writer a few days after Yule’s death. And Yule
    himself would have taken pleasure in the idea of those meetings with his
    old travellers, which seemed so certain to his surviving friends.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

  <p>He rests in the old cemetery at Tunbridge Wells, with his second wife, as
    he had directed. A great gathering of friends attended the first part of
    the burial service which was held in London on 3rd January, 1890. Amongst
    those present were witnesses of every stage of his career, from his boyish
    days at the High School of Edinburgh downwards. His daughter, of course,
    was there, led by the faithful, peerless friend who was so soon to follow
    him into the Undiscovered Country.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> She and his youngest nephew, with
    two cousins and a few old friends, followed his remains over the snow to
    the graveside. The epitaph subsequently inscribed on the tomb was penned by
    Yule himself, but is by no means representative of his powers in a kind of
    composition in which he had so often excelled in the service of others. As
    a composer of epitaphs and other monumental inscriptions few of our time
    have surpassed, if any have equalled him, in his best efforts.</p>

  <h4><span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxiii">lxxiii</span>
    SIR GEORGE UDNY YULE, C.B., K.C.S.I.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></h4>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">George Udny Yule</span>, born at Inveresk in 1813, passed through Haileybury into
      the Bengal Civil Service, which he entered at the age of 18 years. For
      twenty-five years his work lay in Eastern Bengal. He gradually became known
      to the Government for his activity and good sense, but won a far wider
      reputation as a mighty hunter, alike with hog-spear and double barrel. By
      1856 the roll of his slain tigers exceeded four hundred, some of them of
      special fame; after that he continued slaying his tigers, but ceased to
      count them. For some years he and a few friends used annually to visit
      the plains of the Brahmaputra, near the Garrow Hills—an entirely virgin
      country then, and swarming with large game. Yule used to describe his once
      seeing seven rhinoceroses at once on the great plain, besides herds of wild
      buffalo and deer of several kinds. One of the party started the theory that
      Noah’s Ark had been shipwrecked there! In those days George Yule was the
      only man to whom the Maharajah of Nepaul, Sir Jung Bahadur, conceded leave
      to shoot within his frontier.</p>

    <p>Yule was first called from his useful obscurity in 1856. The year before,
      the Sonthals in insurrection disturbed the long unbroken peace of the
      Delta. These were a numerous non-Aryan, uncivilised, but industrious
      race, driven wild by local mismanagement, and the oppressions of Hindoo
      usurers acting through the regulation courts. After the suppression of
      their rising, Yule was selected by Sir F. Halliday, who knew his man, to
      be Commissioner of the Bhagulpoor Division, containing some six million
      souls, and embracing the hill country of the Sonthals. He obtained sanction
      to a code for the latter, which removed these people entirely from the
      Court system, and its tribe of leeches, and abolished all intermediaries
      between the Sahib and the Sonthal peasant. Through these measures, and his
      personal influence, aided by picked assistants, he was able to effect, with
      extraordinary rapidity, not only their entire pacification, but such a
      beneficial change in their material condition, that they have risen from a
      state of barbarous penury to comparative prosperity and comfort.</p>

    <p>George Yule was thus engaged when the Mutiny broke out, and it soon made
      itself felt in the districts under him. To its suppression within his
      limits, he addressed himself with characteristic vigour. Thoroughly trusted
      by every class—by his Government, by those under him, by planters and by
      Zemindars—he organised a little force, comprising a small detachment of
      the 5th Regiment, a party of British sailors, mounted volunteers from the
      districts, etc., and of this he became practically the captain. Elephants
      were collected from all quarters to spare the legs of his infantry
      and sailors; while dog-carts were turned into limbers for the small
      three-pounders of the seamen. And with this little army George Yule scoured
      the Trans-Gangetic districts, leading it against bodies of the Mutineers,
      routing them upon more than one occasion, and out-manœuvring them by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_lxxiv">lxxiv</span>his
      astonishing marches, till he succeeded in driving them across the Nepaul
      frontier. No part of Bengal was at any time in such danger, and nowhere was
      the danger more speedily and completely averted.</p>

    <p>After this Yule served for two or three years as Chief Commissioner of
      Oudh, where in 1862 he married Miss Pemberton, the daughter of a very
      able father, and the niece of Sir Donald MacLeod, of honoured and beloved
      memory. Then for four or five years he was Resident at Hyderabad, where he
      won the enduring friendship of Sir Salar Jung. “Everywhere he showed the
      same characteristic firm but benignant justice. Everywhere he gained the
      lasting attachment of all with whom he had intimate dealings—except tigers
      and scoundrels.”</p>

    <p>Many years later, indignant at the then apparently supine attitude of
      the British Government in the matter of the Abyssinian captives, George
      Yule wrote a letter (necessarily published without his name, as he was
      then on the Governor-General’s Council), to the editor of an influential
      Indian paper, proposing a private expedition should be organised for their
      delivery from King Theodore, and inviting the editor (Dr. George Smith) to
      open a list of subscriptions in his paper for this purpose, to which Yule
      offered to contribute £2000 by way of beginning. Although impracticable
      in itself, it is probable that, as in other cases, the existence of
      such a project may have helped to force the Government into action. The
      particulars of the above incident were printed by Dr. Smith in his <cite>Memoir
      of the Rev. John Wilson</cite>, but are given here from memory.</p>

    <p>From Hyderabad he was promoted in 1867 to the Governor-General’s Council,
      but his health broke down under the sedentary life, and he retired and came
      home in 1869.</p>

    <p>After some years of country life in Scotland, where he bought a small
      property, he settled near his brother in London, where he was a principal
      instrument in enabling Sir George Birdwood to establish the celebration
      of Primrose Day (for he also was “one of Mr. Gladstone’s converts”). Sir
      George Yule never sought ‘London Society’ or public employment, but in 1877
      he was offered and refused the post of Financial Adviser to the Khedive
      under the Dual control. When his feelings were stirred he made useful
      contributions to the public press, which, after his escape from official
      trammels, were always signed. The very last of these (<cite>St. James Gazette</cite>,
      24th February 1885) was a spirited protest against the snub administered
      by the late Lord Derby, as Secretary of State, to the Colonies, when they
      had generously offered assistance in the Soudan campaign. He lived a quiet,
      happy, and useful life in London, where he was the friend and unwearied
      helper of all who needed help. He found his chief interests in books and
      flowers, and in giving others pleasure. Of rare unselfishness and sweet
      nature, single in mind and motive, fearing God and knowing no other fear,
      he was regarded by a large number of people with admiring affection. He met
      his death by a fall on the frosty pavement at his door, in the very act of
      doing a kindness. An interesting sketch of Sir George Yule’s Indian career,
      by one who knew him thoroughly, is to be found in Sir Edward Braddon’s
      <cite>Thirty Years of Shikar</cite>. An account of his share in the origin of Primrose
      Day appeared in the <cite>St. James’ Gazette</cite> during 1891.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[1]</a> There is a vague tradition that these Yules descend from the
      same stock as the Scandinavian family of the same name, which gave
      Denmark several men of note, including the great naval hero Niels
      Juel. The portraits of these old Danes offer a certain resemblance
      of type to those of their Scots namesakes, and Henry Yule liked
      to play with the idea, much in the same way that he took humorous
      pleasure in his reputed descent from Michael Scott, the Wizard!
      (This tradition was more historical, however, and stood thus:
      Yule’s great grandmother was a Scott of Ancrum, and the Scotts of
      Ancrum had established their descent from Sir Michael Scott of
      Balwearie, reputed to be the Wizard.) Be their origin what it may,
      Yule’s forefathers had been already settled on the Border hills
      for many generations, when in the time of James VI. they migrated
      to the lower lands of East Lothian, where in the following reign
      they held the old fortalice of Fentoun Tower of Nisbet of Dirleton.
      When Charles II. empowered his Lord Lyon to issue certificates of
      arms (in place of the Lyon records removed and lost at sea by the
      Cromwellian Government), these Yules were among those who took out
      confirmation of arms, and the original document is still in the
      possession of the head of the family.

      <p>Though Yules of sorts are still to be found in Scotland, the present
        writer is the only member of the Fentoun Tower family now left in
        the country, and of the few remaining out of it most are to be found
        in the Army List.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[2]</a> The literary taste which marked William Yule probably came
      to him from his grandfather, the Rev. James Rose, Episcopal Minister
      of Udny, in Aberdeenshire. James Rose, a non-jurant (<i>i.e.</i> one who
      refused to acknowledge allegiance to the Hanoverian King), was a
      man of devout, large, and tolerant mind, as shown by writings still
      extant. His father, John Rose, was the younger son of the 14th Hugh
      of Kilravock. He married Margaret Udny of Udny, and was induced by
      her to sell his pleasant Ross-shire property and invest the proceeds
      in her own bleak Buchan. When George Yule (about 1759) brought
      home Elizabeth Rose as his wife, the popular feeling against the
      Episcopal Church was so strong and bitter in Lothian, that all the
      men of the family—themselves Presbyterians—accompanied Mrs. Yule as
      a bodyguard on the occasion of her first attendance at the Episcopal
      place of worship. Years after, when dissensions had arisen in the
      Church of Scotland, Elizabeth Yule succoured and protected some of
      the dissident Presbyterian ministers from their persecutors.</div>

      ship which took Udny Yule to India was burnt at sea. After keeping
      himself afloat for several hours in the water, he was rescued by a
      passing ship and taken back to the Mauritius, whence, having lost
      everything but his cadetship, he made a fresh start for India, where
      he and William for many years had a common purse. Colonel Udny Yule
      commanded a brigade at the Siege of Cornelis (1811), which gave us
      Java, and afterwards acted as Resident under Sir Stamford Raffles.
      Forty-five years after the retrocession of Java, Henry Yule found
      the memory of his uncle still cherished there.</div>

      <a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[12]</a> William Yule died in 1839, and rests with his parents,
      brothers, and many others of his kindred, in the ruined chancel
      of the ancient Norman Church of St. Andrew, at Gulane, which had
      been granted to the Yule family as a place of burial by the Nisbets
      of Dirleton, in remembrance of the old kindly feeling subsisting
      for generations between them and their tacksmen in Fentoun Tower.
      Though few know its history, a fragrant memorial of this wise and
      kindly scholar is still conspicuous in Edinburgh. The magnificent
      wall-flower that has, for seventy summers, been a glory of the
      Castle rock, was originally all sown by the patient hand of Major
      Yule, the self-sowing of each subsequent year, of course, increasing
      the extent of bloom. Lest the extraordinarily severe spring of
      1895 should have killed off much of the old stock, another (but
      much more limited) sowing on the northern face of the rock was in
      that year made by his grand-daughter, the present writer, with the
      sanction and active personal help of the lamented General (then
      Colonel) Andrew Wauchope of Niddrie Marischal. In Scotland, where
      the memory of this noble soldier is so greatly revered, some may
      like to know this little fact. May the wall-flower of the Castle
      rock long flourish a fragrant memorial of two faithful soldiers and
      true-hearted Scots.</div>

      Scotland. He was Engineer to Sir C. Fellows’ Expedition, which
      gave the nation the Lycian Marbles, and while Commanding R.E. in
      Edinburgh, was largely instrumental in rescuing St. Margaret’s
      Chapel in the Castle from desecration and oblivion. He was a
      thorough Scot, and never willingly tolerated the designation N.B.
      on even a letter. He had cultivated tastes, and under a somewhat
      austere exterior he had a most tender heart. When already past
      sixty, he made a singularly happy marriage to a truly good woman,
      who thoroughly appreciated him. He was the author of several Memoirs

      Before these words were written, Yule had had the sorrow of
      losing his elder brother Robert, who had fallen in action before
      Delhi (19th June, 1857), whilst in command of his regiment, the
      9th Lancers. Robert Abercromby Yule (born 1817) was a very noble
      character and a fine soldier. He had served with distinction in the
      campaigns in Afghanistan and the Sikh Wars, and was the author of an
      excellent brief treatise on Cavalry Tactics. He had a ready pencil
      and a happy turn for graceful verse. In prose his charming little
      allegorical tale for children, entitled <cite>The White Rhododendron</cite>,
      is as pure and graceful as the flower whose name it bears. Like
      both his brothers, he was at once chivalrous and devout, modest,
      impulsive, and impetuous. No officer was more beloved by his men
      than Robert Yule, and when some one met them carrying back his
      covered body from the field and enquired of the sergeant: “Who
      have you got there?” the reply was: “Colonel Yule, and better have
      lost half the regiment, sir.” It was in the chivalrous effort to
      extricate some exposed guns that he fell. Some one told afterwards
      that when asked to go to the rescue, he turned in the saddle,
      looked back wistfully on his regiment, well knowing the cost of
      such an enterprise, then gave the order to advance and charge. “No
      stone marks the spot where Yule went down, but no stone is needed
      to commemorate his valour” (Archibald Forbes, in <cite>Daily News</cite>,
      8th Feb. 1876). At the time of his death Colonel R. A. Yule had
      been recommended for the C.B. His eldest son, Colonel J. H. Yule,
      C.B., distinguished himself in several recent campaigns (on the
      Burma-Chinese frontier, in Tirah, and South Africa).</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[43]</a> Baker went home in November, 1857, but did not retire until
      the following year.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[44]</a> Nothing was more worthy of respect in Yule’s fine character
      than the energy and success with which he mastered his natural
      temperament in the last ten years of his life, when few would have
      guessed his original fiery disposition.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="label">[45]</a> Not without cause did Sir J. P. Grant officially record
      that “to his imperturbable temper the Government of India owed much.”</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="label">[46]</a> Yule’s colour-blindness was one of the cases in which
      Dalton, the original investigator of this optical defect, took
      special interest. At a later date (1859) he sent Yule, through
      Professor Wilson, skeins of coloured silks to name. Yule’s elder
      brother Robert had the same peculiarity of sight, and it was also
      present in two earlier and two later generations of their mother’s
      family—making five generations in all. But in no case did it pass
      from parent to child, always passing in these examples, by a sort
      of Knight’s move, from uncle to nephew. Another peculiarity of
      Yule’s more difficult to describe was the instinctive association
      of certain architectural forms or images with the days of the week.
      He once, and once only (in 1843), met another person, a lady who
      was a perfect stranger, with the same peculiarity. About 1878–79
      he contributed some notes on this obscure subject to one of the
      newspapers, in connection with the researches of Mr. Francis Galton,
      on Visualisation, but the particulars are not now accessible.</div>

      relics, by the present writer.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[50]</a> Many years later Yule wrote of Lord Canning as follows: “He
      had his defects, no doubt. He had not at first that entire grasp of
      the situation that was wanted at such a time of crisis. But there
      is a virtue which in these days seems unknown to Parliamentary
      statesmen in England—Magnanimity. Lord Canning was an English
      statesman, and he was surpassingly magnanimous. There is another
      virtue which in Holy Writ is taken as the type and sum of all
      righteousness—Justice—and he was eminently just. The misuse of
      special powers granted early in the Mutiny called for Lord Canning’s
      interference, and the consequence was a flood of savage abuse;
      the violence and bitterness of which it is now hard to realise.”
      (<cite>Quarterly Review</cite>, April, 1883, p. 306.)</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="label">[51]</a> During the next ten years Yule continued to visit London

      Sir Roderick Murchison.</div>

      and trial pass without recording here my deep gratitude to our dear
      and honoured friend, John Ruskin. As my dear mother stood on the
      threshold between life and death at Mornex that sad spring, he was
      untiring in all kindly offices of friendship. It was her old friend,
      Principal A. J. Scott (then eminent, now forgotten), who sent him
      to call. He came to see us daily when possible, sometimes bringing
      MSS. of Rossetti and others to read aloud (and who could equal his
      reading?), and when she was too ill for this, or himself absent, he
      would send not only books and flowers to brighten the bare rooms of
      the hillside inn (then very primitive), but his own best treasures
      of Turner and W. Hunt, drawings and illuminated missals. It was an
      anxious solace; and though most gratefully enjoyed, these treasures
      were never long retained.</div>

      permanent good was effected. And it was just the same afterwards in
      Scotland, where an old Highland gillie, describing his experience
      of the Yule brothers, said: “I was liking to take out Sir George,
      for <em>he</em> takes the time to enjoy the hills, but (plaintively), the
      Kornel is no good, for he’s just as restless as a water-wagtail!” If
      there be any <i lang="fr">mal de l’écritoire</i> corresponding to <i lang="fr">mal du pays</i>,
      Yule certainly had it.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[62]</a> The Russian Government in 1873 paid the same work the
      very practical compliment of circulating it largely amongst their
      officers in Central Asia.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[64]</a> This subject is too lengthy for more than cursory allusion
      here, but the patient analytic skill and keen venatic instinct with
      which Yule not only proved the forgery of the alleged <cite>Travels of
      Georg Ludwig von ——</cite> (that had been already established by Lord
      Strangford, whose last effort it was, and Sir Henry Rawlinson),
      but step by step traced it home to the arch-culprit Klaproth, was
      nothing less than masterly.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">[65]</a> This is probably the origin of the odd misstatement as to
      Yule occupying himself at Palermo with photography, made in the
      delightful <cite>Reminiscences</cite> of the late Colonel Balcarres Ramsay.
      Yule never attempted photography after 1852.</div>

      <a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[66]</a> She was a woman of fine intellect and wide reading; a
      skilful musician, who also sang well, and a good amateur artist in
      the style of Aug. Delacroix (of whom she was a favourite pupil).
      Of French and Italian she had a thorough and literary mastery, and
      how well she knew her own language is shown by the sound and pure
      English of a story she published in early life, under the pseudonym
      of Max Lyle (<cite>Fair Oaks, or The Experiences of Arnold Osborne,
      M.D.</cite>, 2 vols., 1856). My mother was partly of Highland descent on
      both sides, and many of her fine qualities were very characteristic
      of that race. Before her marriage she took an active part in many
      good works, and herself originated the useful School for the Blind
      at Bath, in a room which she hired with her pocket-money, where she
      and her friend Miss Elwin taught such of the blind poor as they
      could gather together.

      <p>In the tablet which he erected to her memory in the family
        burial-place of St. Andrew’s, Gulane, her husband described her
        thus:—“A woman singular in endowments, in suffering, and in faith;
        to whom to live was Christ, to die was gain.”</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98" class="label">[74]</a> Yule had published a brief but very interesting Memoir
      of Major Rennell in the <cite>R. E. Journal</cite> in 1881. He was extremely
      proud of the circumstance that Rennell’s surviving grand-daughter
      presented to him a beautiful wax medallion portrait of the great
      geographer. This wonderfully life-like presentment was bequeathed by
      Yule to his friend Sir Joseph Hooker, who presented it to the Royal
      Society.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99" class="label">[75]</a> Knowing his veneration for that noble lady, I had written
      to tell her of his condition, and to ask her to give him this last
      pleasure of a few words. The response was such as few but herself
      could write. This letter was not to be found after my father’s
      death, and I can only conjecture that it must either have been given
      away by himself (which is most improbable), or was appropriated by
      some unauthorised outsider.</div>

    <h4 id="CHAPTER_Ii">I. <span class="smcap">Obscurities in the History of his Life
      and Book. Ramusio’s Statements.</span></h4>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">1. <span class="smcap">With</span> all the intrinsic interest of Marco Polo’s Book it may perhaps be
    doubted if it would have continued to exercise such <span class="sidenote">Obscurities of Polo’s Book, and personal History.</span>fascination on many
    minds through successive generations were it not for the difficult questions
    which it suggests. It is a great book of puzzles, whilst our confidence in
    the man’s veracity is such that we feel certain every puzzle has a solution.</p>

  <p>And such difficulties have not attached merely to the identification of
    places, the interpretation of outlandish terms, or the illustration of
    obscure customs; for strange entanglements have perplexed also the chief
    circumstances of the Traveller’s life and authorship. The time of the
    dictation of his Book and of the execution of his Last Will have been
    almost the only undisputed epochs in his biography. The year of his birth
    has been contested, and the date of his death has not been recorded; the
    critical occasion of his capture by the Genoese, to which we seem to owe
    the happy fact that he did not go down mute to the tomb of his fathers,
    has been made the subject of chronological difficulties; there are in the
    various texts of his story variations hard to account for; the very tongue
    in which it was written down has furnished a question, solved only in our
    own age, and in a most unexpected manner.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i2"><i>2</i></span></p>

  <p>2. The first person who attempted to gather and string the <span class="sidenote">Ramusio, his earliest biographer. His account of Polo.</span>facts of Marco
    Polo’s personal history was his countryman, the celebrated John Baptist
    Ramusio. His essay abounds in what we now know to be errors of detail, but,
    prepared as it was when traditions of the Traveller were still rife in
    Venice, a genuine thread runs through it which could never have been spun
    in later days, and its presentation seems to me an essential element in any
    full discourse upon the subject.</p>

  <p>Ramusio’s preface to the Book of Marco Polo, which opens the second volume
    of his famous Collection of Voyages and Travels, and is addressed to his
    learned friend Jerome Fracastoro, after referring to some of the most noted
    geographers of antiquity, proceeds:<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Of all that I have named, Ptolemy, as the latest, possessed the
      greatest extent of knowledge. Thus, towards the North, his knowledge
      carries him beyond the Caspian, and he is aware of its being shut in
      all round like a lake,—a fact which was unknown in the days of Strabo
      and Pliny, though the Romans were already lords of the world. But
      though his knowledge extends so far, a tract of 15 degrees beyond that
      sea he can describe only as Terra Incognita; and towards the South
      he is fain to apply the same character to all beyond the Equinoxial.
      In these unknown regions, as regards the South, the first to make
      discoveries have been the Portuguese captains of our own age; but as
      regards the North and North-East the discoverer was the Magnifico
      Messer Marco Polo, an honoured nobleman of Venice, nearly 300 years
      since, as may be read more fully in his own Book. And in truth it makes
      one marvel to consider the immense extent of the journeys made, first
      by the Father and Uncle of the said Messer Marco, when they proceeded
      continually towards the East-North-East, all the way to the Court of
      the Great Can and the Emperor of the Tartars; and afterwards again by
      the three of them when, on their return homeward, they traversed the
      Eastern and Indian Seas. Nor is that all, for one marvels also how the
      aforesaid gentleman was able to give such an orderly description of
      all that he had seen; seeing that such an accomplishment was possessed
      by very few in his day, and he had had a large part of his nurture
      among those uncultivated Tartars, without any regular training in
      the art of composition. His Book indeed, owing to the endless errors
      and inaccuracies that had crept into it, had come for many years to
      be regarded as fabulous; and the opinion prevailed that the names
      of cities and provinces contained therein were all fictitious and
      imaginary, without any ground in fact, or were (I might rather say)
      mere dreams.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i3"><i>3</i></span></p>

    <p>3. “Howbeit, during the last hundred years, persons acquainted with
      Persia have begun to recognise the existence of Cathay. <span class="sidenote">Ramusio vindicates Polo’s Geography.</span>The voyages of
      the Portuguese also towards the North-East, beyond the Golden Chersonese,
      have brought to knowledge many cities and provinces of India, and many
      islands likewise, with those very names which our Author applies to them;
      and again, on reaching the Land of China, they have ascertained from the
      people of that region (as we are told by Sign. John de Barros, a Portuguese
      gentleman, in his Geography) that Canton, one of the chief cities of that
      kingdom, is in 30⅔° of latitude, with the coast running N.E. and S.W.; that
      after a distance of 275 leagues the said coast turns towards the N.W.; and
      that there are three provinces along the sea-board, Mangi, Zanton, and
      Quinzai, the last of which is the principal city and the King’s Residence,
      standing in 46° of latitude. And proceeding yet further the coast attains
      to 50°.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Seeing then how many particulars are in our day becoming known
      of that part of the world concerning which Messer Marco has written, I have
      deemed it reasonable to publish his book, with the aid of several copies
      written (as I judge) more than 200 years ago, in a perfectly accurate form,
      and one vastly more faithful than that in which it has been heretofore
      read. And thus the world shall not lose the fruit that may be gathered from
      so much diligence and industry expended upon so honourable a branch of
      knowledge.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>4. Ramusio, then, after a brief apologetic parallel of the marvels related
    by Polo with those related by the Ancients and by the modern discoverers in
    the West, such as Columbus and Cortes, proceeds:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“And often in my own mind, comparing the land explorations of these our
      Venetian gentlemen with the sea explorations of the aforesaid Signor
      Don Christopher, I have asked myself which of the two were really the
      more marvellous. <span class="sidenote">Ramusio compares Polo with Columbus.</span>And if patriotic prejudice delude me not, methinks
      good reason might be adduced for setting the land journey above the sea
      voyage. Consider only what a height of courage was needed to undertake and
      carry through so difficult an enterprise, over a route of such desperate
      length and hardship, whereon it was sometimes necessary to carry food for
      the supply of man and beast, not for days only but for months together.
      Columbus, on the other hand, going by sea, readily carried with him all
      necessary provision; and after a voyage of some 30 or 40 days was conveyed
      by the wind whither he desired to go, whilst the Venetians again took a
      whole year’s time to pass all those great deserts and mighty rivers. Indeed
      that the difficulty of travelling to Cathay was so much greater than that
      of reaching the New World, and the route so much longer and more perilous,
      may be gathered from the fact that, since those gentlemen twice made this
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i4"><i>4</i></span>journey, no one from Europe has dared to repeat it,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> whereas in the very
      year following the discovery of the Western Indies many ships immediately
      retraced the voyage thither, and up to the present day continue to do so,
      habitually and in countless numbers. Indeed those regions are now so well
      known, and so thronged by commerce, that the traffic between Italy, Spain,
      and England is not greater.”</p>
    </blockquote>

  <p>5. Ramusio goes on to explain the light regarding the first part or
    prologue of Marco Polo’s book that he had derived <span class="sidenote">Recounts a tradition of the travellers’ return to Venice.</span>from a recent piece
    of luck which had made him partially acquainted with the geography of
    Abulfeda, and to make a running commentary on the whole of the preliminary
    narrative until the final return of the travellers to Venice:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“And when they got thither the same fate befel them as befel Ulysses,
      who, when he returned, after his twenty years’ wanderings, to his
      native Ithaca, was recognized by nobody. Thus also those three
      gentlemen who had been so many years absent from their native city
      were recognized by none of their kinsfolk, who were under the firm
      belief that they had all been dead for many a year past, as indeed had
      been reported. Through the long duration and the hardships of their
      journeys, and through the many worries and anxieties that they had
      undergone, they were quite changed in aspect, and had got a certain
      indescribable smack of the Tartar both in air and accent, having indeed
      all but forgotten their Venetian tongue. Their clothes too were coarse
      and shabby, and of a Tartar cut. They proceeded on their arrival to
      their house in this city in the confine of St. John Chrysostom, where
      you may see it to this day. The house, which was in those days a very
      lofty and handsome palazzo, is now known by the name of the <em>Corte
      del Millioni</em> for a reason that I will tell you presently. Going
      thither they found it occupied by some of their relatives, and they
      had the greatest difficulty in making the latter understand who they
      should be. For these good people, seeing them to be in countenance so
      unlike what they used to be, and in dress so shabby, flatly refused to
      believe that they were those very gentlemen of the Ca’ Polo whom they
      had been looking upon for ever so many years as among the dead.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> So
      these three gentlemen,—this is a story I have often heard when I was a
      youngster from the illustrious Messer <span class="smcap">Gasparo Malpiero</span>, a gentleman of
      very great age, and a Senator of eminent virtue and integrity, whose
      house was on the Canal of Santa Marina, exactly at the corner over the
      mouth of the Rio di S. Giovanni Chrisostomo, and just midway among the
      buildings of the aforesaid Corte del Millioni, and he said he had heard
      the story from his own father and grandfather, and from other old men
      among the neighbours,—the three gentlemen, I say, devised a scheme
      by which they should at once bring about their recognition <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i5"><i>5</i></span>by their
      relatives, and secure the honourable notice of the whole city; and this
      was it:—</p>

    <p>“They invited a number of their kindred to an entertainment, which
      they took care to have prepared with great state and splendour in that
      house of theirs; and when the hour arrived for sitting down to table
      they came forth of their chamber all three clothed in crimson satin,
      fashioned in long robes reaching to the ground such as people in those
      days wore within doors. And when water for the hands had been served,
      and the guests were set, they took off those robes and put on others of
      crimson damask, whilst the first suits were by their orders cut up and
      divided among the servants. Then after partaking of some of the dishes
      they went out again and came back in robes of crimson velvet, and
      when they had again taken their seats, the second suits were divided
      as before. When dinner was over they did the like with the robes of
      velvet, after they had put on dresses of the ordinary fashion worn by
      the rest of the company.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> These proceedings caused much wonder and
      amazement among the guests. But when the cloth had been drawn, and all
      the servants had been ordered to retire from the dining hall, Messer
      Marco, as the youngest of the three, rose from table, and, going into
      another chamber, brought forth the three shabby dresses of coarse stuff
      which they had worn when they first arrived. Straightway they took
      sharp knives and began to rip up some of the seams and welts, and to
      take out of them jewels of the greatest value in vast quantities, such
      as rubies, sapphires, carbuncles, diamonds and emeralds, which had all
      been stitched up in those dresses in so artful a fashion that nobody
      could have suspected the fact. For when they took leave of the Great
      Can they had changed all the wealth that he had bestowed upon them into
      this mass of rubies, emeralds, and other jewels, being well aware of
      the impossibility of carrying with them so great an amount in gold over
      a journey of such extreme length and difficulty. Now this exhibition
      of such a huge treasure of jewels and precious stones, all tumbled out
      upon the table, threw the guests into fresh amazement, insomuch that
      they seemed quite bewildered and dumbfounded. And now they recognized
      that in spite of all former doubts these were in truth those honoured
      and worthy gentlemen of the Ca’ Polo that they claimed to be; and so
      all paid them the greatest honour and reverence. And when the story
      got wind in Venice, straightway the whole city, gentle and simple,
      flocked to the house to embrace them, and to make much of them, with
      every conceivable demonstration of affection and respect. On Messer
      Maffio, who was the eldest, they conferred the honours of an office
      that was of great dignity in those days; whilst the young men came
      daily to visit and converse with the ever polite and gracious Messer
      Marco, and to ask him questions about Cathay and the Great Can, all
      which he answered with such kindly courtesy that every man felt himself
      in a manner his debtor. And as it happened that in the story, which he
      was constantly called on to repeat, of the magnificence of the Great
      Can, he would speak of his revenues as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i6"><i>6</i></span>amounting to ten or fifteen
      <em>millions</em> of gold; and in like manner, when recounting other instances
      of great wealth in those parts, would always make use of the term
      <em>millions</em>, so they gave him the nickname of <span class="smcap">Messer Marco Millioni</span>:
      a thing which I have noted also in the Public Books of this Republic
      where mention is made of him.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The Court of his House, too, at S.
      Giovanni Chrisostomo, has always from that time been popularly known as
      the Court of the Millioni.</p>


    <p>6. “Not many months after the arrival of the travellers at Venice, news
      came that <span class="smcap">Lampa Doria</span>, Captain of the Genoese Fleet, had advanced with 70
      galleys to the Island of Curzola, upon which orders were issued by the
      Prince of the Most Illustrious Signory for the arming of 90 galleys with
      all the expedition possible, <span class="sidenote">Recounts Marco’s capture by the Genoese.</span>
      and Messer Marco Polo for his valour was
      put in charge of one of these. So he with the others, under the command
      of the Most Illustrious <span class="smcap">Messer Andrea Dandolo</span>, Procurator of St. Mark’s,
      as Captain General, a very brave and worthy gentleman, set out in search
      of the Genoese Fleet. They fought on the September feast of Our Lady,
      and, as is the common hazard of war, our fleet was beaten, and Polo was
      made prisoner. For, having pressed on in the vanguard of the attack, and
      fighting with high and worthy courage in defence of his country and his
      kindred, he did not receive due support, and being wounded, he was taken,
      along with Dandolo, and immediately put in irons and sent to Genoa.</p>

    <p>“When his rare qualities and marvellous travels became known there, the
      whole city gathered to see him and to speak with him, and he was no longer
      entreated as a prisoner but as a dear friend and honoured gentleman. Indeed
      they showed him such honour and affection that at all hours of the day
      he was visited by the noblest gentlemen of the city, and was continually
      receiving presents of every useful kind. Messer Marco finding himself in
      this position, and witnessing the general eagerness to hear all about
      Cathay and the Great Can, which indeed compelled him daily to repeat his
      story till he was weary, was advised to put the matter in writing. So
      having found means to get a letter written to his father here at Venice,
      in which he desired the latter to send the notes and memoranda which he
      had brought home with him, after the receipt of these, and assisted by
      a Genoese gentleman, who was a great friend of his, and who took great
      delight in learning about the various regions of the world, and used on
      that account to spend many hours daily in the prison with him, he wrote
      this present book (to please him) in the Latin tongue.</p>

    <p>“To this day the Genoese for the most part write what they have to write
      in that language, for there is no possibility of expressing their natural
      dialect with the pen.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Thus then it came to pass that the Book was put
      forth at first by Messer Marco in Latin; but as many copies were taken, and
      as it was rendered into our vulgar tongue, all Italy became filled with it,
      so much was this story desired and run after.</p>


    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i7"><i>7</i></span></p>

    <p>7. “The captivity of Messer Marco greatly disturbed the minds of Messer
      Maffio and his father Messer Nicolo. They had decided, whilst still on
      their travels, <span class="sidenote">Ramusio’s account of Marco’s liberation and marriage.</span>
      that Marco should marry as soon as they should get to
      Venice; but now they found themselves in this unlucky pass, with so much
      wealth and nobody to inherit it. Fearing that Marco’s imprisonment might
      endure for many years, or, worse still, that he might not live to quit it
      (for many assured them that numbers of Venetian prisoners had been kept in
      Genoa a score of years before obtaining liberty); seeing too no prospect
      of being able to ransom him,—a thing which they had attempted often and by
      various channels,—they took counsel together, and came to the conclusion
      that Messer Nicolo, who, old as he was, was still hale and vigorous, should
      take to himself a new wife. This he did; and at the end of four years he
      found himself the father of three sons, Stefano, Maffio, and Giovanni. Not
      many years after, Messer Marco aforesaid, through the great favour that he
      had acquired in the eyes of the first gentlemen of Genoa, and indeed of
      the whole city, was discharged from prison and set free. Returning home
      he found that his father had in the meantime had those three other sons.
      Instead of taking this amiss, wise and discreet man that he was, he agreed
      also to take a wife of his own. He did so accordingly, but he never had any
      son, only two girls, one called Moreta and the other Fantina.</p>

    <p>“When at a later date his father died, like a good and dutiful son he
      caused to be erected for him a tomb of very honourable kind for those days,
      being a great sarcophagus cut from the solid stone, which to this day may
      be seen under the portico before the Church of S. Lorenzo in this city, on
      the right hand as you enter, with an inscription denoting it to be the tomb
      of Messer Nicolo Polo of the contrada of S. Gio. Chrisostomo. The arms of
      his family consist of a <em>Bend</em> with three birds on it, and the colours,
      according to certain books of old histories in which you see all the coats
      of the gentlemen of this city emblazoned, are the field <em>azure</em>, the bend
      <em>argent</em>, and the three birds <em>sable</em>. These last are birds of that kind
      vulgarly termed <em>Pole</em>,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or, as the Latins call them, <em>Gracculi</em>.</p>

    <p>8. “As regards the after duration of this noble and worthy family, I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i8"><i>8</i></span>find
      that Messer Andrea Polo of San Felice had three sons, the first of whom
      was Messer Marco, the second Maffio, the third Nicolo. <span class="sidenote">Ramusio’s account
      of the Family Polo and its termination.</span> The two last were
      those who went to Constantinople first, and afterwards to Cathay, as has
      been seen. Messer Marco the elder being dead, the wife of Messer Nicolo who
      had been left at home with child, gave birth to a son, to whom she gave
      the name of Marco in memory of the deceased, and this is the Author of our
      Book. Of the brothers who were born from his father’s second marriage, viz.
      Stephen, John, and Matthew, I do not find that any of them had children,
      except Matthew. He had five sons and one daughter called Maria; and she,
      after the death of her brothers without offspring, inherited in 1417 all
      the property of her father and her brothers. She was honourably married
      to Messer <span class="smcap">Azzo Trevisano</span> of the parish of Santo Stazio in this city, and
      from her sprung the fortunate and honoured stock of the Illustrious Messer
      <span class="smcap">Domenico Trevisano</span>, Procurator of St. Mark’s, and valorous Captain General
      of the Sea Forces of the Republic, whose virtue and singular good qualities
      are represented with augmentation in the person of the Most Illustrious
      Prince Ser <span class="smcap">Marc’Antonio Trevisano</span>, his son.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

    <p>“Such has been the history of this noble family of the Ca’ Polo, which
      lasted as we see till the year of our Redemption 1417, in which year died
      childless Marco Polo, the last of the five sons of Maffeo, and so it came
      to an end. Such be the chances and changes of human affairs!”</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_IIi">II. <span class="smcap">Sketch of the State of the East at the time of the Journeys of the Polo
    Family.</span></h4>

  <p>9. The story of the travels of the Polo family opens in 1260.</p>

  <p>Christendom had recovered from the alarm into which it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i9"><i>9</i></span>had been thrown some
    18 years before when the Tartar cataclysm had threatened to engulph it.<span class="sidenote">State of the Levant.</span>
    The Tartars themselves were already becoming an object of curiosity rather
    than of fear, and soon became an object of hope, as a possible help against
    the old Mahomedan foe. The frail Latin throne in Constantinople was still
    standing, but tottering to its fall. The successors of the Crusaders still
    held the Coast of Syria from Antioch to Jaffa, though a deadlier brood of
    enemies than they had yet encountered was now coming to maturity in the
    Dynasty of the Mamelukes, which had one foot firmly planted in Cairo, the
    other in Damascus. The jealousies of the commercial republics of Italy
    were daily waxing greater. The position of Genoese trade on the coasts of
    the Aegean was greatly depressed, through the predominance which Venice
    had acquired there by her part in the expulsion of the Greek Emperors, and
    which won for the Doge the lofty style of Lord of Three-Eighths of the
    Empire of Romania. But Genoa was biding her time for an early revenge,
    and year by year her naval strength and skill were increasing. Both these
    republics held possessions and establishments in the ports of Syria, which
    were often the scene of sanguinary conflicts between their citizens.
    Alexandria was still largely frequented in the intervals of war as the
    great emporium of Indian wares, but the facilities afforded by the Mongol
    conquerors who now held the whole tract from the Persian Gulf to the shores
    of the Caspian and of the Black Sea, or nearly so, were beginning to give
    a great advantage to the caravan routes which debouched at the ports of
    Cilician Armenia in the Mediterranean and at Trebizond on the Euxine.
    Tana (or Azov) had not as yet become the outlet of a similar traffic; the
    Venetians had apparently frequented to some extent the coast of the Crimea
    for local trade, but their rivals appear to have been in great measure
    excluded from this commerce, and the Genoese establishments which so long
    flourished on that coast, are first heard of some years after a Greek
    dynasty was again in possession of Constantinople.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>10. In Asia and Eastern Europe scarcely a dog might bark without Mongol
    leave, from the borders of Poland and the Gulf <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i10"><i>10</i></span>of Scanderoon to the Amur
    and the Yellow Sea. <span class="sidenote">The various Mongol Sovereignties in Asia and Eastern Europe.</span>The vast empire which Chinghiz had conquered still
    owned a nominally supreme head in the Great Kaan,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but practically it was
    splitting up into several great monarchies under the descendants of the
    four sons of Chinghiz, Juji, Chaghatai, Okkodai, and Tuli; and wars on a
    vast scale were already brewing between them. Hulaku, third son of Tuli,
    and brother of two Great Kaans, Mangku and Kúblái, had become practically
    independent as ruler of Persia, Babylonia, Mesopotamia, and Armenia, though
    he and his sons, and his sons’ sons, continued to stamp the name of the
    Great Kaan upon their coins, and to use the Chinese seals of state which he
    bestowed upon them. The Seljukian Sultans of Iconium, whose dominion bore
    the proud title of Rúm (Rome), were now but the struggling bondsmen of the
    Ilkhans. The Armenian <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i11"><i>11</i></span>Hayton in his Cilician Kingdom had pledged a more
    frank allegiance to the Tartar, the enemy of his Moslem enemies.</p>

  <p>Barka, son of Juji, the first ruling prince of the House of Chinghiz to
    turn Mahomedan, reigned on the steppes of the Volga, where a standing camp,
    which eventually became a great city under the name of Sarai, had been
    established by his brother and predecessor Batu.</p>

  <p>The House of Chaghatai had settled upon the pastures of the Ili and the
    valley of the Jaxartes, and ruled the wealthy cities of Sogdiana.</p>

  <p>Kaidu, the grandson of Okkodai who had been the successor of Chinghiz in
    the Kaanship, refused to acknowledge the transfer of the supreme authority
    to the House of Tuli, and was through the long life of Kúblái a thorn in
    his side, perpetually keeping his north-western frontier in alarm. His
    immediate authority was exercised over some part of what we should now
    call Eastern Turkestan and Southern Central Siberia; whilst his hordes of
    horsemen, force of character, and close neighbourhood brought the Khans of
    Chaghatai under his influence, and they generally acted in concert with him.</p>

  <p>The chief throne of the Mongol Empire had just been ascended by Kúblái,
    the most able of its occupants after the Founder. Before the death of his
    brother and predecessor Mangku, who died in 1259 before an obscure fortress
    of Western China, it had been intended to remove the seat of government
    from Kara Korum on the northern verge of the Mongolian Desert to the more
    populous regions that had been conquered in the further East, and this
    step, which in the end converted the Mongol Kaan into a Chinese Emperor,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
    was carried out by Kúblái.</p>

  <p>11. For about three centuries the Northern provinces of China had been
    detached from native rule, and subject to foreign dynasties; first to the
    <em>Khitan</em>, <span class="sidenote">China.</span>a people from the basin of the Sungari River, and supposed (but
    doubtfully) to have been akin to the Tunguses, whose rule subsisted for 200
    years, and originated the name of <span class="smcap">Khitai</span>, Khata, or <span class="smcap">Cathay</span>, by which for
    nearly 1000 years China has been known to the nations of Inner Asia, and to
    those <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i12"><i>12</i></span>whose acquaintance with it was got by that channel.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The Khitan,
    whose dynasty is known in Chinese history as the <em>Liao</em> or “Iron,” had been
    displaced in 1123 by the Chúrchés or Niu-chen, another race of Eastern
    Tartary, of the same blood as the modern Manchus, whose Emperors in their
    brief period of prosperity were known by the Chinese name of Tai-<em>Kin</em>, by
    the Mongol name of the <em>Altun</em> Kaans, both signifying “Golden.” Already in
    the lifetime of Chinghiz himself the northern Provinces of China Proper,
    including their capital, known as Chung-tu or Yen-King, now Peking, had
    been wrenched from them, and the conquest of the dynasty was completed by
    Chinghiz’s successor Okkodai in 1234.</p>

  <p>Southern China still remained in the hands of the native dynasty of the
    Sung, who had their capital at the great city now well known as Hang-chau
    fu. Their dominion was still substantially untouched, but its subjugation
    was a task to which Kúblái before many years turned his attention, and
    which became the most prominent event of his reign.</p>

  <p>12. In India the most powerful sovereign was the Sultan of Delhi,
    Nassir-uddin Mahmud of the Turki House of Iltitmish;<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
    but, <span class="sidenote">India, and Indo-China.</span>though both
    Sind and Bengal acknowledged his supremacy, no part of Peninsular India
    had yet been invaded, and throughout the long period of our Traveller’s
    residence in the East the Kings of Delhi had their hands too full, owing
    to the incessant incursions of the Mongols across the Indus, to venture
    on extensive campaigning in the south. Hence the Dravidian Kingdoms
    of Southern India were as yet untouched by foreign conquest, and the
    accumulated gold of ages lay in their temples and treasuries, an easy prey
    for the coming invader.</p>

  <p>In the Indo-Chinese Peninsula and the Eastern Islands a variety of kingdoms
    and dynasties were expanding and contracting, of which we have at best but
    dim and shifting glimpses. That they were advanced in wealth and art, far
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i13"><i>13</i></span>beyond what the present state of those regions would suggest, is attested
    by vast and magnificent remains of Architecture, nearly all dating, so far
    as dates can be ascertained, from the 12th to the 14th centuries (that

    continent and the Islands, as at Pagán in Burma, at Ayuthia in Siam, at
    Angkor in Kamboja, at Borobodor and Brambánan in Java. All these remains
    are deeply marked by Hindu influence, and, at the same time, by strong
    peculiarities, both generic and individual.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_116" href="#FNanchor_116" class="label">[2]</a> We endeavour to preserve throughout the book the distinction
      that was made in the age of the Mongol Empire between <em>Khán</em> and
      <em>Ḳaán</em> (<span lang="ar">خان</span> and <span lang="ar">قآان</span>, as written by Arabic and Persian
      authors). The former may be rendered <em>Lord</em>, and was applied
      generally to Tartar chiefs whether sovereign or not; it has since
      become in Persia, and especially in Afghanistan, a sort of “Esq.,”
      and in India is now a common affix in the names of (Musulman)
      Hindustanis of all classes; in Turkey alone it has been reserved for
      the Sultan. <em>Ḳaán</em>, again, appears to be a form of <em>Kháḳán</em>, the
      <span lang="el">Χαγάνος</span> of the Byzantine historians, and was the peculiar
      title of the supreme sovereign of the Mongols; the Mongol princes
      of Persia, Chaghatai, etc., were entitled only to the former affix
      (Khán), though <em>Ḳaán</em> and <em>Ḳhaḳán</em> are sometimes applied to them
      in adulation. Polo always writes <em>Kaan</em> as applied to the Great
      Khan, and does not, I think, use <em>Khan</em> in any form, styling the
      subordinate princes by their name only, as <em>Argon</em>, <em>Alau</em>, etc.
      <em>Ilkhan</em> was a special title assumed by Huláku and his successors
      in Persia; it is said to be compounded from a word <em>Il</em>, signifying
      tribe or nation. The relation between <em>Khán</em> and <em>Khaḳán</em> seems to
      be probably that the latter signifies “<em>Khán of Kháns</em>,” Lord of
      Lords. Chinghiz, it is said, did not take the higher title; it was
      first assumed by his son Okkodai. But there are doubts about this.
      (See <cite>Quatremère’s Rashid</cite>, pp. 10 <i>seqq.</i> and <cite>Pavet de Courteille,
      Dict. Turk-Oriental.</cite>) The tendency of swelling titles is always
      to degenerate, and when the value of Khan had sunk, a new form,
      <em>Khán-khánán</em>, was devised at the Court of Delhi, and applied to one
      of the high officers of state.

      <p>[Mr. Rockhill writes (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 108, note): “The title <em>Khan</em>,
        though of very great antiquity, was only used by the Turks after
        <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 560, at which time the use of the word <em>Khatun</em> came in use
        for the wives of the Khan, who himself was termed <em>Ilkhan</em>. The
        older title of <em>Shan-yü</em> did not, however, completely disappear
        among them, for Albiruni says that in his time the chief of the Ghuz
        Turks, or Turkomans, still bore the title of <em>Jenuyeh</em>, which Sir
        Henry Rawlinson (<cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite>, v. 15) takes to be the same word
        as that transcribed <em>Shan-yü</em> by the Chinese (see <cite>Ch’ien Han shu</cite>,
        Bk. 94, and <cite>Chou shu</cite>, Bk. 50, 2). Although the word <em>Khakhan</em>
        occurs in Menander’s account of the embassy of Zemarchus, the
        earliest mention I have found of it in a Western writer is in the
        <cite>Chronicon</cite> of Albericus Trium Fontium, where (571), under the year
        1239, he uses it in the form <em>Cacanus</em>”—Cf. <cite>Terrien de Lacouperie,

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_IIIi">III. <span class="smcap">The Polo Family. Personal History of the Travellers down to their
    final Return from the East.</span></h4>

  <p>13. In days when History and Genealogy were allowed to draw largely on the
    imagination for the <i lang="fr">origines</i> of states and families, <span class="sidenote">Alleged origin of the Polos.</span>it was set down
    by one Venetian Antiquary that among the companions of King Venetus, or
    of Prince Antenor of Troy, when they settled on the northern shores of
    the Adriatic, there was one <span class="smcap">Lucius Polus</span>, who became the progenitor of
    our Traveller’s Family;<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> whilst another deduces it from <span class="smcap">Paolo</span> the first
    Doge<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (Paulus Lucas Anafestus of Heraclea, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 696).</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i14"><i>14</i></span></p>

  <p>More trustworthy traditions, recorded among the Family Histories of Venice,
    but still no more it is believed than traditions, represent the Family of
    Polo as having come from Sebenico in Dalmatia, in the 11th century.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
    Before the end of the century they had taken seats in the Great Council
    of the Republic; for the name of Domenico Polo is said to be subscribed
    to a grant of 1094, that of Pietro Polo to an act of the time of the Doge
    Domenico Michiele in 1122, and that of a Domenico Polo to an acquittance
    granted by the Doge Domenico Morosini and his Council in 1153.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p>The ascertained genealogy of the Traveller, however, begins only with his
    grandfather, who lived in the early part of the 13th century.</p>

  <p>Two branches of the Polo Family were then recognized, distinguished by the
    <i lang="it">confini</i> or Parishes in which they lived, as Polo of S. Geremia, and Polo
    of S. Felice. <span class="smcap">Andrea Polo</span> of S. Felice was the father of three sons, <span class="smcap">Marco</span>,
    <span class="smcap">Nicolo</span>, and <span class="smcap">Maffeo</span>. And Nicolo was the Father of our Marco.</p>

  <p>14. Till quite recently it had never been precisely ascertained whether
    the immediate family of our Traveller belonged to the <em>Nobles</em> of Venice
    properly so called, <span class="sidenote">Claims to be styled noble.</span>who had seats in the Great Council and were enrolled in
    the Libro d’Oro. Ramusio indeed styles our Marco <i lang="it">Nobile</i> and <i lang="it">Magnifico</i>,
    and Rusticiano, the actual scribe of the Traveller’s recollections, calls
    him “<i lang="it">sajes et noble citaiens de Venece</i>,” but Ramusio’s accuracy and
    Rusticiano’s precision were scarcely to be depended on. Very recently,
    however, since the subject has been discussed with accomplished students of
    the Venice Archives, proofs have been found establishing Marco’s personal
    claim to nobility, inasmuch as both in judicial decisions and in official
    resolutions of the Great Council, he is designated <i lang="it">Nobilis Vir</i>, a formula
    which would never have been used in such documents (I am assured) had he
    not been technically noble.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i15"><i>15</i></span></p>

  <p>15. Of the three sons of Andrea Polo of S. Felice, Marco seems to have been
    the eldest, and Maffeo the youngest.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
    <span class="sidenote">Marco the Elder.</span>They were all engaged in commerce,
    and apparently in a partnership, which to some extent held good even when
    the two younger had been many years absent in the Far East.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Marco seems
    to have been established for a time at Constantinople,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and also to have
    had a house (no doubt of business) at Soldaia, in the Crimea, where his son
    and daughter, Nicolo and Maroca by name, were living in 1280. This year is
    the date of the Elder Marco’s Will, executed at Venice, and when he was
    “weighed down by bodily ailment.” Whether he survived for any length of
    time we do not know.</p>

  <p>16. Nicolo Polo, the second of the Brothers, had two legitimate sons,
    <span class="smcap">Marco</span>, the Author of our Book, born in 1254,<a id="FNanchor_128"
    href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and <span class="smcap">Maffeo</span>, <span class="sidenote">Nicolo and Maffeo commence their travels.</span>of whose place
    in the family we shall have a few words to say presently. The story opens,
    as we have said, in 1260, when we find the two brothers, Nicolo and Maffeo
    the Elder, at Constantinople. How long they had been absent from Venice
    we are not distinctly told. Nicolo had left his wife there behind him;
    Maffeo apparently was a bachelor. In the year named they started on a
    trading venture to the Crimea, whence a succession of openings and chances,
    recounted in the Introductory chapters of Marco’s work, carried them
    far north along the Volga, and thence first to Bokhara, and then to the
    Court of the Great Kaan Kúblái in the Far East, on or within the borders
    of <span class="smcap">Cathay</span>. That a great and civilized country so called existed in the
    extremity of Asia had already been reported in Europe by the Friars Plano
    Carpini (1246) and William Rubruquis (1253), who had not indeed reached its
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i16"><i>16</i></span>frontiers, but had met with its people at the Court of the Great Kaan in
    Mongolia; whilst the latter of the two with characteristic acumen had seen
    that they were identical with the Seres of classic fame.</p>

  <p>17. Kúblái had never before fallen in with European gentlemen. He was
    delighted with these Venetians, <span class="sidenote">Their intercourse with Kúblái Kaan.</span>listened with strong interest to all that
    they had to tell him of the Latin world, and determined to send them back
    as his ambassadors to the Pope, accompanied by an officer of his own Court.
    His letters to the Pope, as the Polos represent them, were mainly to desire
    the despatch of a large body of educated missionaries to convert his
    people to Christianity. It is not likely that religious motives influenced
    Kúblái in this, but he probably desired religious aid in softening and
    civilizing his rude kinsmen of the Steppes, and judged, from what he saw
    in the Venetians and heard from them, that Europe could afford such aid of
    a higher quality than the degenerate Oriental Christians with whom he was
    familiar, or the Tibetan Lamas on whom his patronage eventually devolved
    when Rome so deplorably failed to meet his advances.</p>

  <p>18. The Brothers arrived at Acre in April,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> 1269, and found that no Pope
    existed, for Clement IV. was dead the year before, <span class="sidenote">Their return home, and Marco’s appearance on the scene.</span>and no new election had
    taken place. So they went home to Venice to see how things stood there
    after their absence of so many years.</p>

  <p>The wife of Nicolo was no longer among the living, but he found his son
    Marco a fine lad of fifteen.</p>

  <p>The best and most authentic MSS. tell us no more than this. But one
    class of copies, consisting of the Latin version made by our Traveller’s
    contemporary, Francesco Pipino, and of the numerous editions based
    indirectly upon it, represents that Nicolo had left Venice when Marco was
    as yet unborn, and consequently had never seen him till his return from the
    East in 1269.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i17"><i>17</i></span></p>

  <p>We have mentioned that Nicolo Polo had another legitimate son, by name
    Maffeo, and him we infer to have been younger than Marco, because he is
    named last (<i lang="it">Marcus et Matheus</i>) in the Testament of their uncle Marco the
    Elder. We do not know if they were by the same mother. They could not have
    been so if we are right in supposing Maffeo to have been the younger, and
    if Pipino’s version of the history be genuine. If however we reject the
    latter, as I incline to do, no ground remains for supposing that Nicolo
    went to the East much before we find him there viz., in 1260, and Maffeo
    may have been born of the same mother during the interval between 1254 and
    1260. If on the other hand Pipino’s version be held to, we must suppose
    that Maffeo (who is named by his uncle in 1280, during his father’s second
    absence in the East) was born of a marriage contracted during Nicolo’s
    residence at home after his first journey, a residence which lasted from
    1269 to 1271.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>19. The Papal interregnum was the longest known, at least since the dark
    ages. Those two years passed, and yet the Cardinals at Viterbo had come
    to no agreement. <span class="sidenote">Second Journey of the Polo Brothers, accompanied by Marco.</span>The brothers were unwilling to let the Great Kaan think
    them faithless, and perhaps they hankered after the virgin field of
    speculation that they had discovered; so they started again for the East,
    taking young Mark with them. At Acre they took counsel with an eminent
    churchman, <span class="smcap">Tedaldo</span> (or Tebaldo) <span class="smcap">Visconti</span>, Archdeacon <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i19"><i>19</i></span>of Liège, whom the
    Book represents to have been Legate in Syria, and who in any case was a
    personage of much gravity and influence. From him they got letters to
    authenticate the causes of the miscarriage of their mission, and started
    for the further East. But they were still at the port of Ayas on the Gulf
    of Scanderoon, which was then becoming one of the chief points of arrival
    and departure for the inland trade of Asia, when they were overtaken by the
    news that a Pope was at last elected, and that the choice had fallen upon
    their friend Archdeacon Tedaldo. They immediately returned to Acre, and at
    last were able to execute the Kaan’s commission, and to obtain a reply. But
    instead of the hundred able teachers of science and religion whom Kúblái
    is said to have asked for, the new Pope, Gregory X., could supply but two
    Dominicans; and these lost heart and drew back when they had barely taken
    the first step of the journey.</p>

  <p>Judging from certain indications we conceive it probable that the three
    Venetians, whose second start from Acre took place about November 1271,
    proceeded by Ayas and Sivas, and then by Mardin, Mosul, and Baghdad, to
    Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, with the view of going on by sea,
    but that some obstacle arose which compelled them to abandon this project
    and turn north again from Hormuz.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i20"><i>20</i></span>traversed successively
    Kerman and Khorasan, Balkh and Badakhshan, whence they ascended the Panja
    or upper Oxus to the Plateau of Pamir, a route not known to have been
    since followed by any European traveller except Benedict Goës, till the
    spirited expedition of Lieutenant John Wood of the Indian Navy in 1838.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
    Crossing the Pamir highlands the travellers descended upon Kashgar, whence
    they proceeded by Yarkand and Khotan, and the vicinity of Lake Lob, and
    eventually across the Great Gobi Desert to Tangut, the name then applied
    by Mongols and Persians to territory at the extreme North-west of China,
    both within and without the Wall. Skirting the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i21"><i>21</i></span>northern frontier of China
    they at last reached the presence of the Kaan, who was at his usual summer
    retreat at Kai-ping fu, near the base of the Khingan Mountains, and nearly
    100 miles north of the Great Wall at Kalgan. If there be no mistake in the
    time (three years and a half) ascribed to this journey in all the existing
    texts, the travellers did not reach the Court till about May of 1275.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

  <p>20. Kúblái received the Venetians with great cordiality, and took kindly
    to young Mark, who must have been by this time one-and-twenty. <span class="sidenote">Marco’s employment by Kúblái Kaan; and his journeys.</span>The <em>Joenne
    Bacheler</em>, as the story calls him, applied himself to the acquisition of
    the languages and written characters in chief use among the multifarious
    nationalities included in the Kaan’s Court and administration; and Kúblái
    after a time, seeing his discretion and ability, began to employ him in
    the public service. M. Pauthier has found a record in the Chinese Annals
    of the Mongol Dynasty, which states that in the year 1277, a certain <span class="smcap">Polo</span>
    was nominated a second-class commissioner or agent attached to the Privy
    Council, a passage which we are happy to believe to refer to our young
    traveller.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

  <p>His first mission apparently was that which carried him through the
    provinces of Shan-si, Shen-si, and Sze-ch’wan, and the wild country on
    the East of Tibet, to the remote province of Yun-nan, called by the
    Mongols Karájàng, and which had been partially conquered by an army under
    Kúblái himself in 1253, before his accession to the throne.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Mark,
    during his stay at court, had observed the Kaan’s delight in hearing of
    strange countries, their marvels, manners, and oddities, and had heard
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i22"><i>22</i></span>his Majesty’s frank expressions of disgust at the stupidity of his
    commissioners when they could speak of nothing but the official business on
    which they had been sent. Profiting by these observations, he took care to
    store his memory or his note-books with all curious facts that were likely
    to interest Kúblái, and related them with vivacity on his return to Court.
    This first journey, which led him through a region which is still very
    nearly a <i lang="la">terra incognita</i>, and in which there existed and still exists,
    among the deep valleys of the Great Rivers flowing down from Eastern Tibet,
    and in the rugged mountain ranges bordering Yun-nan and Kwei-chau, a vast
    Ethnological Garden, as it were, of tribes of various race and in every
    stage of uncivilisation, afforded him an acquaintance with many strange
    products and eccentric traits of manners, wherewith to delight the Emperor.</p>

  <p>Mark rose rapidly in favour, and often served Kúblái again on distant
    missions, as well as in domestic administration, but we gather few details
    as to his employments. At one time we know that he held for three years
    the government of the great city of Yang-chau, though we need not try to
    magnify this office, as some commentators have done, into the viceroyalty
    of one of the great provinces of the Empire; on another occasion we find
    him with his uncle Maffeo, passing a year at Kan-chau in Tangut; again,
    it would appear, visiting Kara Korum, the old capital of the Kaans in
    Mongolia; on another occasion in Champa or Southern Cochin China; and
    again, or perhaps as a part of the last expedition, on a mission to the
    Indian Seas, when he appears to have visited several of the southern states
    of India. We are not informed whether his father and uncle shared in such
    employments;<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and the story of their services rendered to the Kaan
    in promoting the capture of the city of Siang-yang, by the construction
    of powerful engines of attack, is too much perplexed by difficulties of
    chronology to be cited with confidence. Anyhow they were gathering wealth,
    and after years of exile they began to dread what might follow old Kúblái’s
    death, and longed to carry their gear and their own grey heads safe home to
    the Lagoons. The aged Emperor <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i23"><i>23</i></span>growled refusal to all their hints, and but
    for a happy chance we should have lost our mediæval Herodotus.</p>

  <p>21. Arghún Khan of Persia, Kúblái’s great-nephew, had in 1286 lost his
    favourite wife the Khatun Bulughán; and, mourning her sorely, <span class="sidenote">Circumstances
    of the Departure of the Polos from the Kaan’s Court.</span>took steps to
    fulfil her dying injunction that her place should be filled only by a lady
    of her own kin, the Mongol Tribe of Bayaut. Ambassadors were despatched to
    the Court of Kaan-baligh to seek such a bride. The message was courteously
    received, and the choice fell on the lady Kokáchin, a maiden of 17, “<i lang="fr">moult
    bele dame et avenant</i>.” The overland road from Peking to Tabriz was not
    only of portentous length for such a tender charge, but was imperilled
    by war, so the envoys desired to return by sea. Tartars in general were
    strangers to all navigation; and the envoys, much taken with the Venetians,
    and eager to profit by their experience, especially as Marco had just then
    returned from his Indian mission, begged the Kaan as a favour to send the
    three <em>Firinghis</em> in their company. He consented with reluctance, but,
    having done so, fitted the party out nobly for the voyage, charging the
    Polos with friendly messages for the potentates of Europe, including the
    King of England. They appear to have sailed from the port of Zayton (as the
    Westerns called T’swan-chau or Chin-cheu in Fo-kien) in the beginning of
    1292. It was an ill-starred voyage, involving long detentions on the coast
    of Sumatra, and in the South of India, to which, however, we are indebted
    for some of the best chapters in the book; and two years or upwards passed
    before they arrived at their destination in Persia.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The three hardy
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i24"><i>24</i></span>Venetians survived all perils, and so did the lady, who had come to look on
    them with filial regard; but two of the three envoys, and a vast proportion
    of the suite, had perished by the way.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Arghún Khan too had been dead
    even before they quitted China;<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> his brother Kaikhátú reigned in his
    stead; and his son Gházán succeeded to the lady’s hand. We are told by
    one who knew both the princes well that Arghún was one of the handsomest
    men of his time, whilst Gházán was, among all his host, one of the most
    insignificant in appearance. But in other respects the lady’s change was
    for the better. Gházán had some of the highest qualities of a soldier, a
    legislator and a king, adorned by many and varied accomplishments; though

  <p>22. The princess, whose enjoyment of her royalty was brief, wept as she
    took leave of the kindly and noble Venetians. <span class="sidenote">They pass by Persia to Venice. Their relations there.</span>They went on to Tabriz, and

  <p>We have related Ramusio’s interesting tradition, like a bit out of the
    Arabian Nights, of the reception that the Travellers met with from their
    relations, and of the means that they took to establish their position with
    those relations, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i25"><i>25</i></span>with Venetian society.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Of the relations, Marco the
    Elder had probably been long dead;<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Maffeo the brother of our Marco was
    alive, and we hear also of a cousin (<i lang="la">consanguineus</i>) Felice Polo, and his
    wife Fiordelisa, without being able to fix their precise position in the
    family. We know also that Nicolo, who died before the end of the century,
    left behind him two illegitimate sons, Stefano and Zannino. It is not
    unlikely that these were born from some connection entered into during the
    long <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i26"><i>26</i></span>residence of the Polos in Cathay, though naturally their presence in
    the travelling company is not commemorated in Marco’s Prologue.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

      Polo of Rialto. Contemporary with these is a family of Polos (1139,
      1183, 1193, 1201) at Chioggia (<cite>Documents and Lists of Documents

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124" class="label">[5]</a> See Appendix C, Nos. 4, 5, and 16. It was supposed that
      an autograph of Marco as member of the Great Council had been
      discovered, but this proves to be a mistake, as will be explained
      further on (see <a href="#Footnote_254">p. <i>74</i></a>, note). In those days the demarcation between
      Patrician and non-Patrician at Venice, where all classes shared in
      commerce, all were (generally speaking) of one race, and where there
      were neither castles, domains, nor trains of horsemen, formed no
      wide gulf. Still it is interesting to establish the verity of the
      old tradition of Marco’s technical nobility.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="label">[6]</a> Marco’s seniority rests only on the assertion of Ramusio,
      who also calls Maffeo older than Nicolo. But in Marco the Elder’s
      Will these two are always (3 times) specified as “<i lang="it">Nicolaus et Matheus</i>.”</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126" class="label">[7]</a> This seems implied in the Elder Marco’s Will (1280): “<i lang="it">Item

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_127" href="#FNanchor_127" class="label">[8]</a> In his Will he terms himself “Ego Marcus Polo quondam de

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_128" href="#FNanchor_128" class="label">[9]</a> There is no real ground for doubt as to this. All the
      extant MSS. agree in making Marco fifteen years old when his father
      returned to Venice in 1269.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="label">[10]</a> Baldelli and Lazari say that the Bern MS. specifies 30th

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="label">[11]</a> Pipino’s version runs: “Invenit Dominus Nicolaus Paulus
      uxorem suam esse defunctam, quae in recessu suo fuit praegnans.
      Invenitque filium, Marcum nomine, qui jam annos xv. habebat aetatis,
      qui post discessum ipsius de Venetiis natus fuerat de uxore sua
      praefatâ.” To this Ramusio adds the further particular that the
      mother died in giving birth to Mark.

      <p>The interpolation is older even than Pipino’s version, for we find
        in the rude Latin published by the Société de Géographie “quam cum
        Venetiis primo recessit praegnantem dimiserat.” But the statement is
        certainly an <em>interpolation</em>, for it does not exist in any of the
        older texts; nor have we any good reason for believing that it was
        an <em>authorised</em> interpolation. I suspect it to have been introduced
        to harmonise with an erroneous date for the commencement of the
        travels of the two brothers.</p>

      <p>Lazari prints: <span lang="it">“Messer Nicolò trovò che la sua donna era morta, e
        n’era rimasto un fanciullo di <em>dodici</em> anni per nome Marco, <em>che il
        padre non avea veduto mai, perchè non era ancor nato quando egli
        partì</em>.”</span> These words have no equivalent in the French Texts, but are
        taken from one of the Italian MSS. in the Magliabecchian Library,
        and are I suspect also interpolated. The <em>dodici</em> is pure error (see
        <a href="#Page_21">p. 21</a> <i>infra</i>).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="label">[12]</a> The last view is in substance, I find, suggested by Cicogna
      (ii. 389).

      <p>The matter is of some interest, because in the Will of the
        younger Maffeo, which is extant, he makes a bequest to his uncle
        (<em>Avunculus</em>) Jordan Trevisan. This seems an indication that his
        mother’s name may have been Trevisan. The same Maffeo had a daughter
        <em>Fiordelisa</em>. And Marco the Elder, in his Will (1280), appoints
        as his executors, during the absence of his brothers, the same
        Jordan Trevisan and his own sister-in-law <em>Fiordelisa</em> (“Jordanum
        Trivisanum de confinio S. Antonini: et Flordelisam cognatam meam”).
        Hence I conjecture that this <i lang="la">cognata Fiordelisa</i> (Trevisan?) was
        the wife of the absent Nicolo, and the mother of Maffeo. In that
        case of course Maffeo and Marco were the sons of different mothers.
        With reference to the above suggestion of Nicolo’s second marriage
        in 1269 there is a curious variation in a fragmentary Venetian
        Polo in the Barberini Library at Rome. It runs, in the passage
        corresponding to the latter part of ch. ix. of Prologue: <span lang="it">“i qual
        do fratelli steteno do anni in Veniezia aspettando la elletion de
        nuovo Papa, <em>nel qual tempo Mess. Nicolo si tolse moier et si la
        lasò graveda.</em>”</span> I believe, however, that it is only a careless
        misrendering of Pipino’s statement about Marco’s birth.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="label">[13]</a> [Major Sykes, in his remarkable book on <cite>Persia</cite>, ch.
      xxiii. pp. 262–263, does not share Sir Henry Yule’s opinion
      regarding this itinerary, and he writes:

      <p>“To return to our travellers, who started on their second great
        journey in 1271, Sir Henry Yule, in his introduction,<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> makes them
        travel <i>viâ</i> Sivas to Mosul and Baghdád, and thence by sea to Hormuz,
        and this is the itinerary shown on his sketch map. This view I am
        unwilling to accept for more than one reason. In the first place,
        if, with Colonel Yule, we suppose that Ser Marco visited Baghdád, is
        it not unlikely that he should term the River Volga the Tigris,<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
        and yet leave the river of Baghdád nameless? It may be urged that
        Marco believed the legend of the reappearance of the Volga in
        Kurdistán, but yet, if the text be read with care and the character
        of the traveller be taken into account, this error is scarcely
        explicable in any other way, than that he was never there.</p>

      <p>“Again, he gives no description of the striking buildings of
        Baudas, as he terms it, but this is nothing to the inaccuracy of
        his supposed onward journey. To quote the text, ‘A very great river
        flows through the city, ... and merchants descend some eighteen days
        from Baudas, and then come to a certain city called Kisi,<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> where
        they enter the Sea of India.’ Surely Marco, had he travelled down
        the Persian Gulf, would never have given this description of the
        route, which is so untrue as to point to the conclusion that it was
        vague information given by some merchant whom he met in the course
        of his wanderings.</p>

      <p>“Finally, apart from the fact that Baghdád, since its fall, was
        rather off the main caravan route, Marco so evidently travels east
        from Yezd and thence south to Hormuz, that unless his journey be
        described backwards, which is highly improbable, it is only possible
        to arrive at one conclusion, namely, that the Venetians entered
        Persia near Tabriz, and travelled to Sultania, Kashán, and Yezd.
        Thence they proceeded to Kermán and Hormuz, where, probably fearing
        the sea voyage, owing to the manifest unseaworthiness of the ships,
        which he describes as ‘wretched affairs,’ the Khorasán route was
        finally adopted. Hormuz, in this case, was not visited again until
        the return from China, when it seems probable that the same route
        was retraced to Tabriz, where their charge, the Lady Kokachin,
        ‘moult bele dame et avenant,’ was married to Gházan Khán, the son
        of her fiancé Arghun. It remains to add that Sir Henry Yule may
        have finally accepted this view in part, as in the plate showing
        <cite>Probable View of Marco Polo’s own Geography</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> the itinerary is
        not shown as running to Baghdád.”</p>

      <p>I may be allowed to answer that when Marco Polo <em>started</em> for the
        East, Baghdád was not rather off the main caravan route. The fall
        of Baghdád was not immediately followed by its decay, and we have
        proof of its prosperity at the beginning of the 14th century. Tauris
        had not yet the importance it had reached when the Polos visited it
        on their <em>return</em> journey. We have the will of the Venetian Pietro
        Viglioni, dated from Tauris, 10th December, 1264 (<cite>Archiv. Veneto</cite>,
        xxvi. 161–165), which shows that he was but a pioneer. It was only
        under Arghún Khan (1284–1291) that Tauris became the great market
        for foreign, especially Genoese, merchants, as Marco Polo remarks
        on his return journey; with Gházán and the new city built by that
        prince, Tauris reached a very high degree of prosperity, and was
        then really the chief emporium on the route from Europe to Persia
        and the far East. Sir Henry Yule had not changed his views, and if
        in the plate showing <cite>Probable View of Marco Polo’s own Geography</cite>,
        the itinerary is not shown as running to Baghdád, it is mere neglect
        on the part of the draughtsman.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="label">[14]</a> It is stated by Neumann that this most estimable traveller
      once intended to have devoted a special work to the elucidation
      of Marco’s chapters on the Oxus Provinces, and it is much to be
      regretted that this intention was never fulfilled. Pamir has been
      explored more extensively and deliberately, whilst this book was
      going through the press, by Colonel Gordon, and other officers,
      detached from Sir Douglas Forsyth’s Mission. [We have made use
      of the information given by these officers and by more recent
      travellers.—H.&nbsp;C.]</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="label">[15]</a> Half a year earlier, if we suppose the three years and
      a half to count from Venice rather than Acre. But at that season
      (November) Kúblái would not have been at Kai-ping fu (otherwise Shang-tu).</div>

      <a id="Footnote_135" href="#FNanchor_135" class="label">[16]</a> <cite>Pauthier</cite>, p. ix., and p. 361.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_136" href="#FNanchor_136" class="label">[17]</a> That this was Marco’s first mission is positively stated
      in the Ramusian edition; and though this may be only an editor’s
      gloss it seems well-founded. The French texts say only that the
      Great Kaan, “l’envoia en un message en une terre ou bien avoit vj.
      mois de chemin.” The traveller’s actual Itinerary affords to Vochan
      (Yung-ch’ang), on the frontier of Burma, 147 days’ journey, which
      with halts might well be reckoned six months in round estimate.
      And we are enabled by various circumstances to fix the date of
      the Yun-nan journey between 1277 and 1280. The former limit is
      determined by Polo’s account of the battle with the Burmese, near
      Vochan, which took place according to the Chinese Annals in 1277.
      The latter is fixed by his mention of Kúblái’s son, Mangalai, as
      governing at Kenjanfu (Si-ngan fu), a prince who died in 1280. (See
      vol. ii. pp. 24, 31, also 64, 80.)</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137" class="label">[18]</a> Excepting in the doubtful case of Kan-chau, where one
      reading says that the three Polos were there on business of their
      own not necessary to mention, and another, that only Maffeo and
      Marco were there, “<i lang="fr">en légation</i>.”</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_138" href="#FNanchor_138" class="label">[19]</a> Persian history seems to fix the arrival of the lady
      Kokáchin in the North of Persia to the winter of 1293–1294. The
      voyage to Sumatra occupied three months (vol. i. <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>); they were
      five months detained there (ii. 292); and the remainder of the
      voyage extended to eighteen more (<a href="#Page_35">i. 35</a>),—twenty-six months in all.

      <p>The data are too slight for unexceptional precision, but the
        following adjustment will fairly meet the facts. Say that they
        sailed from Fo-kien in January 1292. In April they would be in
        Sumatra, and find the S.W. Monsoon too near to admit of their
        crossing the Bay of Bengal. They remain in port till September (five
        months), and then proceed, touching (perhaps) at Ceylon, at Kayal,
        and at several ports of Western India. In one of these, <i>e.g.</i> Kayal
        or Tana, they pass the S.W. Monsoon of 1293, and then proceed to the
        Gulf. They reach Hormuz in the winter, and the camp of the Persian
        Prince Gházán, the son of Arghún, in March, twenty-six months from
        their departure.</p>

      <p>I have been unable to trace Hammer’s authority (not Wassáf I find),
        which perhaps gives the precise date of the Lady’s arrival in
        Persia (see <i>infra</i>, <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>). From his narrative, however (<cite>Gesch.
        der Ilchane</cite>, ii. 20), March 1294 is perhaps too late a date. But
        the five months’ stoppage in Sumatra <em>must</em> have been in the S.W.
        Monsoon; and if the arrival in Persia is put earlier, Polo’s numbers
        can scarcely be held to. Or, the eighteen months mentioned at vol.
        i. <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>, must <em>include</em> the five months’ stoppage. We may then
        suppose that they reached Hormuz about November 1293, and Gházán’s
        camp a month or two later.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_139" href="#FNanchor_139" class="label">[20]</a> The French text which forms the <em>basis</em> of my translation
        says that, excluding mariners, there were 600 souls, out of whom
        only 8 survived. The older MS. which I quote as G.&nbsp;T., makes the
        number 18, a fact that I had overlooked till the sheets were printed off.</div>

      <a id="Footnote_141" href="#FNanchor_141" class="label">[22]</a> All dates are found so corrupt that even in this one I do
      not feel absolute confidence. Marco in dictating the book is aware
      that Gházán had attained the throne of Persia (see vol. i. <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a>,
      and ii. pp. 50 and 477), an event which did not occur till October,
      1295. The date assigned to it, however, by Marco (ii. 477) is 1294,
      or the year <em>before</em> that assigned to the return home.

      <p>The travellers may have stopped some time at Constantinople on their
        way, or even may have visited the northern shores of the Black Sea;
        otherwise, indeed, how did Marco acquire his knowledge of that Sea
        (ii. 486–488) and of events in Kipchak (ii. 496 <i>seqq.</i>)? If 1296 was
        the date of return, moreover, the six-and-twenty years assigned in
        the preamble as the period of Marco’s absence (<a href="#Page_2">p. 2</a>) would be nearer
        accuracy. For he left Venice in the spring or summer of 1271.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_142" href="#FNanchor_142" class="label">[23]</a> Marco Barbaro, in his account of the Polo family, tells
      what seems to be the same tradition in a different and more mythical version:—

      <p>“From ear to ear the story has past till it reached mine, that when
        the three Kinsmen arrived at their home they were dressed in the
        most shabby and sordid manner, insomuch that the wife of one of them
        gave away to a beggar that came to the door one of those garments of
        his, all torn, patched, and dirty as it was. The next day he asked
        his wife for that mantle of his, in order to put away the jewels
        that were sewn up in it; but she told him she had given it away to
        a poor man, whom she did not know. Now, the stratagem he employed
        to recover it was this. He went to the Bridge of Rialto, and stood
        there turning a wheel, to no apparent purpose, but as if he were a
        madman, and to all those who crowded round to see what prank was
        this, and asked him why he did it, he answered: ‘He’ll come if God
        pleases.’ So after two or three days he recognised his old coat on
        the back of one of those who came to stare at his mad proceedings,
        and got it back again. Then, indeed, he was judged to be quite the
        reverse of a madman! And from those jewels he built in the contrada
        of S. Giovanni Grisostomo a very fine palace for those days; and the
        family got among the vulgar the name of the <em>Ca’ Million</em>, because
        the report was that they had jewels to the value of a million of
        ducats; and the palace has kept that name to the present day—<i>viz.</i>,
        1566.” (<cite>Genealogies</cite>, MS. copy in <cite>Museo Civico</cite>; quoted also by

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_IVi">IV. <span class="smcap">Digression concerning the Mansion of the Polo Family at Venice.</span></h4>

  <p>23. We have seen that Ramusio places the scene of the story recently
    alluded to at the mansion in the parish of S. Giovanni Grisostomo, the
    court of which was known in his time as the Corte del Millioni; and indeed
    he speaks of <span class="sidenote">Probable period of their establishment at S. Giovanni
    Grisostomo.</span>the Travellers as at once on their arrival resorting to that
    mansion as their family residence. Ramusio’s details have so often proved
    erroneous that I should not be surprised if this also should be a mistake.
    At least we find (so far as I can learn) no previous intimation that the
    family were connected with that locality. The grandfather Andrea is styled
    of <em>San Felice</em>. The will of Maffeo Polo the younger, made in 1300, which
    we shall give hereafter in abstract, appears to be the first document
    that connects the family with S. Giovanni Grisostomo. It indeed styles
    the testator’s father “the late Nicolo Paulo of the confine of St. John
    Chrysostom,” but that only shows what is not disputed, that the Travellers
    after their return from the East settled in this locality. And the same
    will appears to indicate a surviving connexion with S. Felice, for the
    priests and clerks who drew it up and witness it are all of the church of
    S. Felice, and it is to the parson of S. Felice and his successor that
    Maffeo bequeaths an annuity to procure their prayers for the souls of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i27"><i>27</i></span>his
    father, his mother, and himself, though after the successor the annuity
    is to pass on the same condition to the senior priest of S. Giovanni
    Grisostomo. Marco Polo the Elder is in his will described as of <em>S.
    Severo</em>, as is also his sister-in-law Fiordelisa, and the document contains
    no reference to S. Giovanni. On the whole therefore it seems probable that
    the Palazzo in the latter parish was purchased by the Travellers after
    their return from the East.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <div class="caption">Corte del Milione, Venice.</div>
  </div>

  <p>24. The Court which was known in the 16th century as the Corte del Millioni
    has been generally understood to be that now known as the Corte Sabbionera,<span class="sidenote">Relic of the Casa Polo in the Corte Sabbionera.</span>
    and here is still pointed out a relic of Marco Polo’s mansion. [Indeed it
    is called now (1899) <cite>Corte del Milione</cite>; see <a href="#Page_i30">p. <i>30</i></a>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <p>M. Pauthier’s edition is embellished with a good engraving which purports
    to represent the House of Marco Polo. But he has been misled. His engraving
    in fact exhibits, at least as the prominent feature, an embellished
    representation of a small house which exists on the <em>west side</em> of the
    Sabbionera, and which had at one time perhaps that pointed style of
    architecture which his engraving shows, though its present decoration is
    paltry and unreal. But it is on the <em>north side</em> of the Court, and on the
    foundations now occupied by the Malibran theatre, that Venetian tradition
    and the investigations of Venetian antiquaries concur in indicating
    the site of the Casa Polo. At the end of the 16th century a great fire
    destroyed the Palazzo,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and under the description of “an old <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i28"><i>28</i></span>mansion
    ruined from the foundation” it passed into the hands of one Stefano
    Vecchia, who sold it in 1678 to Giovanni Carlo Grimani. He built on the
    site of the ruins a theatre which was in its day one of the largest in
    Italy, and was called the Theatre of S. Giovanni Grisostomo; afterwards the
    <cite>Teatro Emeronitio</cite>. When modernized in our own day the proprietors gave it
    the name of Malibran, in honour of that famous singer, and this it still
    bears.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>[In 1881, the year of the Venice International Geographical Congress, a
    Tablet was put up on the Theatre with the following inscription:—</p>

  <div class="center lh1" lang="it">
    QVI FURONO LE CASE<br />

  </div>

  <p>There is still to be seen on the north side of the Court an arched doorway
    in Italo-Byzantine style, richly sculptured with scrolls, disks, and
    symbolical animals, and on the wall above the doorway is a cross similarly
    ornamented.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The style and the decorations are those which were usual
    in Venice in the 13th century. The arch opens into a passage from which a
    similar doorway at the other end, also retaining some scantier relics of
    decoration, leads to the entrance of the Malibran Theatre. Over the archway
    in the Corte Sabbionera the building rises into a kind of tower. This, as
    well as the sculptured arches and cross, Signor Casoni, who gave a good
    deal of consideration to the subject, believed to be a relic of the old
    Polo House. But the tower (which Pauthier’s view does show) is now entirely
    modernized.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

    attributed erroneously to Albert Dürer. The state of the buildings in the

    corroboration as to the traditional site of the Casa Polo.</span>though I am not
    aware of the grounds of such doubts. But a document recently discovered
    at Venice by Comm. Barozzi, one of a series relating to the testamentary
    estate of Marco Polo, goes far to confirm the tradition. This is the copy
    of a technical definition of two pieces of house property adjoining the
    property of Marco Polo and his brother Stephen, which were sold to Marco
    Polo by his wife Donata<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in June 1321. Though the definition is not
    decisive, from the rarity of topographical references and absence of points
    of the compass, the description <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i31"><i>31</i></span>of Donata’s tenements as standing on the
    Rio (presumably that of S. Giovanni Grisostomo) on one side, opening by
    certain porticoes and stairs on the other to the Court and common alley
    leading to the Church of S. Giovanni Grisostomo, and abutting in two places
    on the <span class="smcap">Ca’ Polo</span>, the property of her husband and Stefano, will apply
    perfectly to a building occupying the western portion of the area on which
    now stands the Theatre, and perhaps forming the western side of a Court of
    which Casa Polo formed the other three sides.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_Vi">V. <span class="smcap">Digression concerning the War-Galleys of the Mediterranean States in the
    Middle Ages.</span></h4>

  <p>25. And before entering on this new phase of the Traveller’s biography it
    may not be <span class="sidenote">Arrangement of the Rowers in Mediæval Galleys: a separate oar
    to every man.</span>without interest that we say something regarding the equipment
    of those galleys which are so prominent in the mediæval history of the
    Mediterranean.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>Eschewing that “Serbonian Bog, where armies whole have sunk” of Books
    and Commentators, the theory of the classification of the Biremes and
    Triremes of the Ancients, we can at least assert on secure grounds that in
    <em>mediæval</em> armament, up to the middle of the 16th century or thereabouts,
    the characteristic distinction of galleys of different calibres, so far
    as such differences existed, was based <em>on the number of rowers that sat
    on one bench pulling each his separate oar, but through one</em> portella
    <em>or rowlock-port</em>.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And to the classes <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i32"><i>32</i></span>of galleys so distinguished the
    Italians, of the later Middle Age at least, did certainly apply, rightly or
    wrongly, the classical terms of <em>Bireme</em>, <em>Trireme</em>, and <em>Quinquereme</em>, in
    the sense of galleys having two men and two oars to a bench, three men and
    three oars to a bench, and five men and five oars to a bench.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>That this was the mediæval arrangement is very certain from the details
    afforded by Marino Sanudo the Elder, confirmed by later writers and by
    works of art. Previous to 1290, Sanudo tells us, almost all the galleys
    that went to the Levant had but two oars and men to a bench; but as it had
    been found that three oars and men to a bench could be employed with great
    advantage, after that date nearly all galleys adopted this arrangement,
    which was called <em>ai Terzaruoli</em>.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p>Moreover experiments made by the Venetians in 1316 had shown that four
    rowers to a bench could be employed still more advantageously. And where
    the galleys could be used on inland waters, and could be made more bulky,
    Sanudo would even recommend five to a bench, or have gangs of rowers on two
    decks with either three or four men to the bench on each deck.</p>

  <p>26. This system of grouping the oars, and putting only one man to an oar,
    continued down to the 16th century, during the <span class="sidenote">Change of System in the 16th century.</span>first half of which came in
    the more modern system of using great oars, equally spaced, and requiring
    from four to seven men each to ply them, in the manner which endured till
    late in the last century, when galleys became altogether obsolete. Captain
    Pantero Pantera, the author of a work on Naval Tactics (1616), says he had
    heard, from veterans <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i33"><i>33</i></span>who had commanded galleys equipped in the antiquated
    fashion, that <em>three</em> men to a bench, with separate oars, answered better
    than three men to one great oar, but four men to one great oar (he says)
    were certainly more efficient than four men with separate oars. The
    new-fashioned great oars, he tells us, were styled <em>Remi di Scaloccio</em>, the
    old grouped oars <em>Remi a Zenzile</em>,—terms the etymology of which I cannot
    explain.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>It may be doubted whether the four-banked and five-banked galleys, of
    which Marino Sanudo speaks, really then came into practical use. A great
    five-banked galley on this system, built in 1529 in the Venice Arsenal by
    Vettor Fausto, was the subject of so much talk and excitement, that it must
    evidently have been something quite new and unheard of.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> So late as 1567
    indeed the King of Spain built at Barcelona a galley of thirty-six benches
    to the side, and seven men to the bench, with a separate oar to each in the
    old fashion. But it proved a failure.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

  <p>Down to the introduction of the great oars the usual system appears to have
    been three oars to a bench for the larger galleys, and two oars for lighter
    ones. The <em>fuste</em> or lighter galleys of the Venetians, even to about the
    middle of the 16th century, had their oars in pairs from the stern to the
    mast, and single oars only from the mast forward.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>27. Returning then to the three-banked and two-banked galleys of the latter
    part of the 13th century, the number of benches on<span class="sidenote">Some details of the 13th century Galleys.</span> each side seems to have
    run from twenty-five to twenty-eight, at least as I interpret Sanudo’s
    calculations. The 100-oared vessels often mentioned (<i>e.g.</i> by <cite>Muntaner</cite>, p.
    419) were probably two-banked vessels with twenty-five benches to a side.</p>

  <div class="figleft illowp25" id="f034">
    <img class="w100" src="images/f034.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>The galleys were very narrow, only 15½ feet in beam.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i34"><i>34</i></span>But to give
    room for the play of the oars and the passage of the fighting-men, &amp;c.,
    this width was largely augmented by an <em>opera-morta</em>, or outrigger
    deck, projecting much beyond the ship’s sides and supported by timber
    brackets.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I do not find it stated how great this projection was in
    the mediæval galleys, but in those of the 17th century it was <em>on each
    side</em> as much as ²⁄₉ths of the true beam. And if it was as great in the
    13th-century galleys the total width between the false gunnels would be
    about 22¼ feet.</p>

  <p>In the centre line of the deck ran, the whole length of the vessel, a
    raised gangway called the <em>corsia</em>, for passage clear of the oars.</p>

  <p>The benches were arranged as in this diagram. The part of the bench next
    the gunnel was at right angles to it, but the other two-thirds of the bench
    were thrown forward obliquely. <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, indicate the position of the
    three rowers. The shortest oar <i>a</i> was called <em>Terlicchio</em>, the middle one
    <i>b Posticcio</i>, the long oar <i>c Piamero</i>.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p>I do not find any information as to how the oars worked on the gunnels.
    The Siena fresco (see <a href="#Page_i35">p. <i>35</i></a>) appears to show them attached by loops and
    pins, which is the usual practice in boats of the Mediterranean now. In
    the cut from D. Tintoretto (<a href="#Page_i37">p. <i>37</i></a>) the groups of oars protrude through
    regular ports in the bulwarks, but this probably represents the use of a
    later day. In any case the oars of each bench must have worked in very
    close proximity. Sanudo states the length of the galleys of his time
    (1300–1320) as 117 feet. This was doubtless length of <em>keel</em>, for that is
    specified (“<i lang="it">da ruoda a ruoda</i>”) in other Venetian measurements, but the
    whole oar space could scarcely have been so much, and with twenty-eight
    benches to a side there could not have been more than 4 feet gunnel-space
    to each bench. And as one of the objects of the grouping of the oars was to
    allow room between the benches for the action of cross-bowmen, &amp;c., it is
    plain that the rowlock space for the three oars must have been very much
    compressed.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i36"><i>36</i></span></p>

  <p>The rowers were divided into three classes, with graduated pay. The highest
    class, who pulled the poop or stroke oars, were called <i lang="it">Portolati</i>; those
    at the bow, called <i lang="it">Prodieri</i>, formed the second class.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>Some elucidation of the arrangements that we have tried to describe will
    be found in our cuts. That at <a href="#f035">p. <i>35</i></a> is from a drawing, by the aid of a
    very imperfect photograph, of part of one of the frescoes of Spinello
    Aretini in the Municipal Palace at Siena, representing a victory of the
    Venetians over the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa’s fleet, commanded by his
    son Otho, in 1176; but no doubt the galleys, &amp;c., are of the artist’s
    own age, the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i37"><i>37</i></span>middle of the 14th century.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In this we see plainly the
    projecting <em>opera-morta</em>, and the rowers sitting two to a bench, each with
    his oar, for these are two-banked. We can also discern the Latin rudder
    on the quarter. (See this volume, <a href="#i118">p. 118</a>.) In a picture in the Uffizj, at
    Florence, of about the same date, by Pietro Laurato (it is in the corridor
    near the entrance), may be seen a small figure of a galley with the oars
    also very distinctly coupled.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Casoni has engraved, after Cristoforo
    Canale, a pictorial plan of a Venetian trireme of the 16th century, which
    shows the arrangement of the oars in <em>triplets</em> very plainly.</p>

  <p>The following cut has been sketched from an engraving of a picture by
    Domenico Tintoretto in the Doge’s palace, representing, I believe, the
    same action (real or imaginary) as Spinello’s fresco, but with the costume
    and construction of a later date. It shows, however, very plainly, the
    projecting <em>opera-morta</em> and the arrangement of the oars in fours, issuing
    through row-ports in high bulwarks.</p>

  <p>28. Midships in the mediæval galley a castle was erected, of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i38"><i>38</i></span>the width
    of the ship, and some 20 feet in length; <span class="sidenote">Fighting Arrangements.</span>its platform being elevated
    sufficiently to allow of free passage under it and over the benches. At
    the bow was the battery, consisting of mangonels (see vol. ii. p. 161
    <i>seqq.</i>) and great cross-bows with winding gear,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> whilst there were
    shot-ports<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> for smaller cross-bows along the gunnels in the intervals
    between the benches. Some of the larger galleys had openings to admit
    horses at the stern, which were closed and caulked for the voyage, being
    under water when the vessel was at sea.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

  <p>It seems to have been a very usual piece of tactics, in attacking as well
    as in awaiting attack, to connect a large number of galleys by hawsers, and
    sometimes also to link the oars together, so as to render it difficult for
    the enemy to break the line or run aboard. We find this practised by the
    Genoese on the defensive at the battle of Ayas (<i>infra</i>, <a href="#Page_i43">p. <i>43</i></a>), and it is
    constantly resorted to by the Catalans in the battles described by Ramon de
    Muntaner.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <p>Sanudo says the toil of rowing in the galleys was excessive, almost
    unendurable. Yet it seems to have been performed by freely-enlisted men,
    and therefore it was probably less severe than that of the great-oared
    galleys of more recent times, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i39"><i>39</i></span>which it was found impracticable to work
    by free enlistment, or otherwise than by slaves under the most cruel
    driving.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> I am not well enough read to say that war-galleys were never
    rowed by slaves in the Middle Ages, but the only doubtful allusion to such
    a class that I have met with is in one passage of Muntaner, where he says,
    describing the Neapolitan and Catalan fleets drawing together for action,
    that the gangs of the galleys had to toil <em>like</em> “forçats” (p. 313).
    Indeed, as regards Venice at least, convict rowers are stated to have been
    first introduced in 1549, previous to which the gangs were of <i lang="it">galeotti
    assoldati</i>.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

  <p>29. We have already mentioned that <span class="sidenote">Crew of a Galley and Staff of a Fleet.</span>Sanudo requires for his three-banked

    was generally a noble.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

  <p>The aggregate pay of such a crew, not including the sopracomito, amounted
    monthly to 60 <i lang="it">lire de’ grossi</i>, or 600 florins, equivalent to 280<i>l.</i> at

  <p>We see that war cost a good deal in money even then.</p>

  <p>Besides the ship’s own complement Sanudo gives an estimate for the general

  <p>30. The musicians formed an important part of the equipment. Sanudo says
    that in going into action every vessel should make the greatest possible
    display of colours; <span class="sidenote">Music; and other particulars.</span>gonfalons and broad banners should float from stem to
    stern, and gay pennons all along the bulwarks; whilst it was impossible to
    have too much of noisy music, of pipes, trumpets, kettle-drums, and what
    not, to put heart into the crew and strike fear into the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

  <p>So Joinville, in a glorious passage, describes the galley of his kinsman,
    the Count of Jaffa, at the landing of St. Lewis in Egypt:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“That galley made the most gallant figure of them all, for it was
      painted all over, above water and below, with scutcheons of the
      count’s arms, the field of which was <em>or</em> with a cross <i lang="fr">patée
      gules</i>.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He had a good 300 rowers in his galley, and every man
      of them had a target blazoned with his arms in beaten gold. And, as
      they came on, the galley looked to be some flying creature, with such
      spirit did the rowers spin it along;—or rather, with the rustle of
      its flags, and the roar of its nacaires and drums and Saracen horns,
      you might have taken it for a rushing bolt of heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The galleys, which were very low in the water,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> could not keep the sea
    in rough weather, and in winter they never willingly kept the sea at night,
    however fair the weather might <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i41"><i>41</i></span>be. Yet Sanudo mentions that he had been
    with armed galleys to Sluys in Flanders.</p>

  <p>I will mention two more particulars before concluding this digression. When
    captured galleys were towed into port it was stern foremost, and with their
    colours dragging on the surface of the sea.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> And the custom of saluting
    at sunset (probably by music) was in vogue on board the galleys of the 13th
    century.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

  <p>We shall now sketch the circumstances that led to the appearance of our
    Traveller in the command of a war-galley.</p>

      (<cite>Archéologie Navale</cite>, Paris, 1839) whilst writing this section, nor
      since, except for a hasty look at his Essay on the difficult subject
      of the oar arrangements. I see that he rejects so great a number of
      oars as I deduce from the statements of Sanudo and others, and that
      he regards a large number of the rowers as supplementary.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_154" href="#FNanchor_154" class="label">[2]</a> It seems the more desirable to elucidate this, because
      writers on mediæval subjects so accomplished as Buchon and Capmany
      have (it would seem) entirely misconceived the matter, assuming that

      rowers <em>three to a bench</em> (p. 59).</div>

      <a id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="label">[4]</a> “<cite>Ad terzarolos</cite>” (<cite>Secreta Fidelium Crucis</cite>, p. 57). The
      Catalan Worthy, Ramon de Muntaner, indeed constantly denounces
      the practice of manning <em>all</em> the galleys with <em>terzaruoli</em>, or
      <em>tersols</em>, as his term is. But his reason is that these thirds-men
      were taken from the oar when crossbowmen were wanted, to act in that
      capacity, and as such they were good for nothing; the crossbowmen,
      he insists, should be men specially enlisted for that service and
      kept to that. He would have some 10 or 20 per cent. only of the
      fleet built very light and manned in threes. He does not seem to
      have contemplated oars three-banked, and crossbowmen <em>besides</em>, as
      Sanudo does. (See below; and <cite>Muntaner</cite>, pp. 288, 323, 525, etc.)

      <p>In Sanudo we have a glimpse worth noting of the word <em>soldiers</em>
        advancing towards the modern sense; he expresses a strong preference
        for <em>soldati</em> (viz. <em>paid</em> soldiers) over <em>crusaders</em> (viz.
        volunteers), p. 74.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_164" href="#FNanchor_164" class="label">[12]</a> Signor Casoni (p. 324) expresses his belief that no galley
      of the 14th century had more than 100 oars. I differ from him with
      hesitation, and still more as I find M. Jal agrees in this view. I
      will state the grounds on which I came to a different conclusion.
      (1) Marino Sanudo assigns 180 rowers for a galley equipped <i lang="it">ai
      Terzaruoli</i> (p. 75). This seemed to imply something near 180 oars,
      for I do not find any allusion to reliefs being provided. In the
      French galleys of the 18th century there were no reliefs except in
      this way, that in long runs without urgency only half the oars were
      pulled. (See <cite>Mém. d’un Protestant condamné aux Galères</cite>, etc.,
      Réimprimés, Paris, 1865, p. 447.) If four men to a bench were to be
      employed, then Sanudo seems to calculate for his smaller galleys
      220 men actually rowing (see pp. 75–78). This seems to assume 55
      benches, <i>i.e.</i>, 28 on one side and 27 on the other, which with
      3-banked oars would give 165 rowers. (2) Casoni himself refers to
      Pietro Martire d’Anghieria’s account of a Great Galley of Venice
      in which he was sent ambassador to Egypt from the Spanish Court in
      1503. The crew amounted to 200, of whom 150 were for working the
      sails and oars, <em>that being the number of oars in each galley</em>,
      one man to each oar and three to each bench. Casoni assumes that
      this vessel must have been much larger than the galleys of the 14th
      century; but, however that may have been, Sanudo to his galley
      assigns the larger crew of 250, of whom almost exactly the same
      proportion (180) were rowers. And in the <em>galeazza</em> described by
      Pietro Martire the oars were used only as an occasional auxiliary.
      (See his <cite>Legationis Babylonicæ Libri Tres</cite>, appended to his 3
      Decads concerning the New World; <cite>Basil</cite>. 1533, f. 77 <i>ver.</i>) (3)
      The galleys of the 18th century, with their great oars 50 feet long
      pulled by six or seven men each, had 25 benches to the side, and
      only 4′ 6″ (French) gunnel-space to each oar. (See <cite>Mém. d’un
      Protest.</cite>, p. 434.) I imagine that a smaller space would suffice for
      the 3 light oars of the mediæval system, so that this need scarcely
      be a difficulty in the face of the preceding evidence. Note also
      the <em>three hundred rowers</em> in Joinville’s description quoted at <a href="#Page_i40">p.
      <i>40</i></a>. The great galleys of the Malay Sultan of Achin in 1621 had,
      according to Beaulieu, from 700 to 800 rowers, but I do not know on
      what system.</div>

      I doubt if there is evidence of its use by the Italians in the
      thirteenth century. Joinville describes it like something strange
      and new.

      <p>In after days the artillery occupied the same position, at the bow
        of the galley.</p>

      <p>Great beams, hung like battering rams, are mentioned by Sanudo, as
        well as iron crow’s-feet with fire attached, to shoot among the
        rigging, and jars of quick-lime and soft soap to fling in the eyes
        of the enemy. The lime is said to have been used by Doria against
        the Venetians at Curzola (<i>infra</i>, <a href="#Page_i48">p. <i>48</i></a>), and seems to have been a
        usual provision. Francesco Barberini specifies among the stores for
        his galley: “<em>Calcina</em>, con lancioni, Pece, pietre, e ronconi” (p.
        259). And Christine de Pisan, in her <cite>Faiz du Sage Roy Charles</cite>
        (V. of France), explains also the use of the soap: “<em>Item</em>, on
        doit avoir pluseurs vaisseaulx legiers à rompre, comme <em>poz plains
        de chauls</em> ou pouldre, et gecter dedens; et, par ce, seront comme
        avuglez, au brisier des poz. <em>Item</em>, on doit avoir autres <em>poz
        de mol savon</em> et gecter es nefzs des adversaires, et quant les
        vaisseaulx brisent, le savon est glissant, si ne se peuent en piez
        soustenir et chiéent en l’eaue” (pt. ii. ch. 38).</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_VIi">VI. <span class="smcap">The Jealousies and Naval Wars of Venice and Genoa. Lamba Doria’s
    Expedition to the Adriatic; Battle of Curzola; and Imprisonment of Marco
    Polo by the Genoese.</span></h4>

  <p>31. Jealousies, too characteristic of the Italian communities, were, in
    the case of the three great trading republics of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa,
    <span class="sidenote">Growing jealousies and outbreaks between the Republics.</span>
    aggravated by commercial rivalries, whilst, between the two first of those
    states, and also between the two last, the bitterness of such feelings had
    been augmenting during the whole course of the 13th century.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>The brilliant part played by Venice in the conquest of Constantinople
    (1204), and the preponderance she thus acquired on the Greek shores,
    stimulated her arrogance and the resentment of her rivals. The three states
    no longer stood on a level as bidders for the shifting favour of the
    Emperor of the East. By treaty, not only was Venice established as the most
    important ally of the empire and as mistress of a large fraction of its
    territory, but all members of nations at war with her were prohibited from
    entering its limits. Though the Genoese colonies continued to exist, they
    stood at a great <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i42"><i>42</i></span>disadvantage, where their rivals were so predominant and
    enjoyed exemption from duties, to which the Genoese remained subject. Hence
    jealousies and resentments reached a climax in the Levantine settlements,
    and this colonial exacerbation reacted on the mother States.</p>

  <p>A dispute which broke out at Acre in 1255 came to a head in a war which
    lasted for years, and was felt all over Syria. It began in a quarrel about
    a very old church called St. Sabba’s, which stood on the common boundary of
    the Venetian and Genoese estates in Acre,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and this flame was blown by
    other unlucky occurrences. Acre suffered grievously.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Venice at this time
    generally kept the upper hand, beating Genoa by land and sea, and driving
    her from Acre altogether.✛ Four ancient porphyry figures from St. Sabba’s
    were sent in triumph to Venice, and with their strange devices still stand
    at the exterior corner of St. Mark’s, towards the Ducal Palace.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p>But no number of defeats could extinguish the spirit of Genoa, and the
    tables were turned when in her wrath she allied herself with Michael
    Palaeologus to upset the feeble and tottering Latin Dynasty, and with
    it the preponderance of Venice on the Bosphorus. The new emperor handed
    over to his allies the castle of their foes, which they tore down with
    jubilations, and now it was their turn to send its stones as trophies to
    Genoa. Mutual hate waxed fiercer than ever; no merchant fleet of either
    state could go to sea without convoy, and wherever their ships met they
    fought.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It was something like the state of things between Spain and
    England in the days of Drake.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp70" id="f042">
    <img class="w100" src="images/f042.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Figures from St. Sabba’s, sent to Venice.</div>
  </div>

  <p>The energy and capacity of the Genoese seemed to rise with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i43"><i>43</i></span>their success,
    and both in seamanship and in splendour they began almost to surpass their
    old rivals. The fall of Acre (1291), and the total expulsion of the Franks
    from Syria, in great measure barred the southern routes of Indian trade,
    whilst the predominance of Genoa in the Euxine more or less obstructed the
    free access of her rival to the northern routes by Trebizond and Tana.</p>

  <p>32. Truces were made and renewed, but the old fire still smouldered. In the
    spring of 1294 it broke into flame, in consequence of the seizure in the
    Grecian seas of three <span class="sidenote">Battle in Bay of Ayas in 1294.</span>Genoese vessels by a Venetian fleet. This led to an
    action with a Genoese convoy which sought redress. The fight took place off
    Ayas in the Gulf of Scanderoon,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and though the Genoese were inferior in
    strength by one-third they gained a signal victory, capturing all but three
    of the Venetian galleys, with rich cargoes, including that of Marco Basilio
    (or Basegio), the commodore.</p>

  <p>This victory over their haughty foe was in its completeness evidently a
    surprise to the Genoese, as well as a source of immense exultation, which
    is vigorously expressed in a ballad of the day, written in a stirring
    salt-water rhythm.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It represents the Venetians, as they enter the
    bay, in arrogant mirth reviling the Genoese with very unsavoury epithets
    as having deserted their ships to skulk on shore. They are described as
    saying:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“‘Off they’ve slunk! and left us nothing;</div>
        <div class="i3">We shall get nor prize nor praise;</div>
        <div class="i3">Nothing save those crazy timbers</div>
        <div class="i6">Only fit to make a blaze.’”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>So they advance carelessly—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“On they come! But lo their blunder!</div>
        <div class="i3">When our lads start up anon,</div>
        <div class="i2">Breaking out like unchained lions,</div>
        <div class="i3">With a roar, ‘Fall on! Fall on!’”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i44"><i>44</i></span></p>

  <p>After relating the battle and the thoroughness of the victory, ending in
    the conflagration of five-and-twenty captured galleys, the poet concludes
    by an admonition to the enemy to moderate his pride and curb his arrogant
    tongue, harping on the obnoxious epithet <i lang="la">porci leproxi</i>, which seems to
    have galled the Genoese.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He concludes:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Nor can I at all remember</div>
        <div class="i3">Ever to have heard the story</div>
        <div class="i1">Of a fight wherein the Victors</div>
        <div class="i3">Reaped so rich a meed of glory!”<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The community of Genoa decreed that the victory should be commemorated by
    the annual presentation of a golden pall to the monastery of St. German’s,
    the saint on whose feast (28th May) it had been won.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p>The startling news was received at Venice with wrath and grief, for the
    flower of their navy had perished, and all energies were bent at once to
    raise an overwhelming force.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The Pope (Boniface VIII.) interfered as
    arbiter, calling for plenipotentiaries from both sides. But spirits were
    too much inflamed, and this mediation came to nought.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i45"><i>45</i></span></p>

  <p>Further outrages on both sides occurred in 1296. The Genoese residences
    at Pera were fired, their great alum works on the coast of Anatolia were
    devastated, and Caffa was stormed and sacked; whilst on the other hand a
    number of the Venetians at Constantinople were massacred by the Genoese,
    and Marco Bembo, their Bailo, was flung from a house-top. Amid such events
    the fire of enmity between the cities waxed hotter and hotter.</p>

  <p>33. In 1298 the Genoese made elaborate preparations for a great blow at the
    enemy, and fitted out a powerful fleet which they placed <span class="sidenote">Lamba Doria’s Expedition to the Adriatic.</span>under the command
    of <span class="smcap">Lamba Doria</span>, a younger brother of Uberto of that illustrious house,
    under whom he had served fourteen years before in the great rout of the
    Pisans at Meloria.</p>

  <p>The rendezvous of the fleet was in the Gulf of Spezia, as we learn from the
    same pithy Genoese poet who celebrated Ayas. This time the Genoese were
    bent on bearding St. Mark’s Lion in his own den; and after touching at
    Messina they steered straight for the Adriatic:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Now, as astern Otranto bears,</div>
        <div class="i3">Pull with a will! and, please the Lord,</div>
        <div class="i3">Let them who bragged, with fire and sword,</div>
        <div class="i1">To waste our homesteads, look to theirs!”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">On their entering the gulf a great storm dispersed the fleet. The admiral
    with twenty of his galleys got into port at Antivari on the Albanian coast,
    and next day was rejoined by fifty-eight more, with which he scoured the
    Dalmatian shore, plundering all Venetian property. Some sixteen of his
    galleys were still missing when he reached the island of Curzola, or
    Scurzola as the more popular name seems to have been, the Black Corcyra of
    the Ancients—the chief town of which, a rich and flourishing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i46"><i>46</i></span>place, the
    Genoese took and burned.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Thus they were engaged when word came that the
    Venetian fleet was in sight.</p>

  <p>Venice, on first hearing of the Genoese armament, sent Andrea Dandolo
    with a large force to join and supersede Maffeo Quirini, who was already
    cruising with a squadron in the Ionian sea; and, on receiving further
    information of the strength of the hostile expedition, the Signory hastily
    equipped thirty-two more galleys in Chioggia and the ports of Dalmatia, and
    despatched them to join Dandolo, making the whole number under his command
    up to something like ninety-five. Recent drafts had apparently told heavily
    upon the Venetian sources of enlistment, and it is stated that many of the
    complements were made up of rustics swept in haste from the Euganean hills.
    To this the Genoese poet seems to allude, alleging that the Venetians, in
    spite of their haughty language, had to go begging for men and money up and
    down Lombardy. “Did <em>we</em> do like that, think you?” he adds:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Beat up for aliens? <em>We</em> indeed?</div>
        <div class="i3">When lacked we homeborn Genoese?</div>
        <div class="i3">Search all the seas, no salts like these,</div>
        <div class="i1">For Courage, Seacraft, Wit at need.”<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Of one of the Venetian galleys, probably in the fleet which sailed
    under Dandolo’s immediate command, went Marco Polo as <i lang="it">Sopracomito</i> or
    Gentleman-Commander.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i47"><i>47</i></span></p>

  <p>34. It was on the afternoon of Saturday the 6th September that the Genoese
    <span class="sidenote">The Fleets come in sight of each other at Curzola.</span>
    saw the Venetian fleet approaching, but, as sunset was not far off, both
    sides tacitly agreed to defer the engagement.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

  <p>The Genoese would appear to have occupied a position near the eastern end
    of the Island of Curzola, with the Peninsula of Sabbioncello behind them,
    and Meleda on their left, whilst the Venetians advanced along the south
    side of Curzola. (See map on <a href="#Page_i50">p. <i>50</i></a>).</p>

  <p>According to Venetian accounts the Genoese were staggered at the sight of
    the Venetian armaments, and sent more than once to seek terms, offering
    finally to surrender galleys and munitions of war, if the crews were
    allowed to depart. This is an improbable story, and that of the Genoese
    ballad seems more like truth. Doria, it says, held a council of his
    captains in the evening at which they all voted for attack, whilst the
    Venetians, with that overweening sense of superiority which at this time is
    reflected in their own annals as distinctly as in those of their enemies,
    kept scout-vessels out to watch that the Genoese fleet, which they looked
    on as already their own, did not steal away in the darkness. A vain
    imagination, says the poet:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Blind error of vainglorious men</div>
        <div class="i3">To dream that we should seek to flee</div>
        <div class="i3">After those weary leagues of sea</div>
        <div class="i1">Crossed, but to hunt them in their den!”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i48"><i>48</i></span></p>

  <p>35. The battle began early on Sunday and lasted till the afternoon. The
    Venetians had the wind in their favour, but the morning sun in their eyes.
    <span class="sidenote">The Venetians defeated, and Marco Polo a prisoner.</span>
    They made the attack, and with great impetuosity, capturing ten Genoese
    galleys; but they pressed on too wildly, and some of their vessels ran
    aground. One of their galleys too, being taken, was cleared of her crew
    and turned against the Venetians. These incidents caused confusion among
    the assailants; the Genoese, who had begun to give way, took fresh heart,
    formed a close column, and advanced boldly through the Venetian line,
    already in disorder. The sun had begun to decline when there appeared
    on the Venetian flank the fifteen or sixteen missing galleys of Doria’s
    fleet, and fell upon it with fresh force. This decided the action. The
    Genoese gained a complete victory, capturing all but a few of the Venetian
    galleys, and including the flagship with Dandolo. The Genoese themselves
    lost heavily, especially in the early part of the action, and Lamba
    Doria’s eldest son Octavian is said to have fallen on board his father’s
    vessel.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The number of prisoners taken was over 7000, and among these
    was Marco Polo.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

  <p>The prisoners, even of the highest rank, appear to have been chained.
    Dandolo, in despair at his defeat, and at the prospect of being carried
    captive into Genoa, refused food, and ended by dashing his head against a
    bench.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> A Genoese account asserts <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i50"><i>50</i></span>that a noble funeral was given him
    after the arrival of the fleet at Genoa, which took place on the evening of
    the 16th October.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It was received with great rejoicing, and the City
    voted the annual presentation of a pallium of gold brocade to the altar
    of the Virgin in the Church of St. Matthew, on every 8th of September,
    the Madonna’s day, on the eve of which the Battle had been won. To the
    admiral himself a Palace was decreed. It still stands, opposite the Church
    of St. Matthew, though it has passed from the possession of the Family.
    On the striped marble façades, both of the Church and of the Palace,
    inscriptions of that age, in excellent preservation, still commemorate
    Lamba’s achievement.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Malik al Mansúr, the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, as

  <p>The latter died at Savona 17th October, 1323, a few months before the most
    illustrious of his prisoners, and his bones were laid in a sarcophagus
    which may still be seen forming the sill of one of the windows of S.
    Matteo (on the right as you enter). Over this sarcophagus stood the Bust
    of Lamba till 1797, when the mob of Genoa, in idiotic imitation of the
    French proceedings of that age, threw it down. All of Lamba’s six sons had
    fought with him at Meloria. In 1291 one of them, Tedisio, went forth into
    the Atlantic in company with Ugolino Vivaldi on a voyage of discovery, and
    never returned. Through Cæsar, the youngest, this branch of the Family

  <p>As to the treatment of the prisoners, accounts differ; a thing usual in
    such cases. The Genoese Poet asserts that the hearts of his countrymen were
    touched, and that the captives were treated with compassionate courtesy.
    Navagiero the Venetian, on the other hand, declares that most of them died
    of hunger.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

    Release of Venetian prisoners.</span>and here, before long, he appears to
    have made acquaintance with a man of literary propensities, whose destiny
    had brought him into the like plight, by name <span class="smcap">Rusticiano</span> or <span class="smcap">Rustichello</span> of
    Pisa. It was this person perhaps who persuaded the Traveller to defer no
    longer the reduction to writing of his notable experiences; but in any case
    it was he who wrote down those experiences at Marco’s dictation; it is he
    therefore to whom we owe the preservation of this record, and possibly even
    that of the Traveller’s very memory. This makes the Genoese imprisonment so
    important an episode in Polo’s biography.</p>

  <p>To Rusticiano we shall presently recur. But let us first bring to a
    conclusion what may be gathered as to the duration of Polo’s imprisonment.</p>

  <p>It does not appear whether Pope Boniface made any new effort for
    accommodation between the Republics; but other Italian princes did
    interpose, and Matteo Visconti, Captain-General of Milan, styling himself
    Vicar-General of the Holy Roman Empire in Lombardy, was accepted as
    Mediator, along with the community of Milan. Ambassadors from both States
    presented themselves at that city, and on the 25th May, 1299, they signed
    the terms of a Peace.</p>

  <p>These terms were perfectly honourable to Venice, being absolutely equal and
    reciprocal; from which one is apt to conclude that the damage to the City
    of the Sea was rather to her pride than to her power; the success of Genoa,
    in fact, having been followed up by no systematic attack upon Venetian
    commerce.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Among the terms was the mutual release of prisoners on a day
    to be fixed by Visconti after the completion of all formalities. This day
    is not recorded, but as the Treaty was ratified by the Doge of Venice on
    the 1st July, and the latest extant document connected with the formalities
    appears to be dated 18th July, we may believe that before the end of August
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i53"><i>53</i></span>Marco Polo was restored to the family mansion in S. Giovanni Grisostomo.</p>

  <p>37. Something further requires to be said before quitting this event in
    our Traveller’s life. For we confess that a critical reader may have some
    <span class="sidenote">Grounds on which the story of Marco Polo’s capture at Curzola rests.</span>
    justification in asking what evidence there is that Marco Polo ever fought
    at Curzola, and ever was carried a prisoner to Genoa from that unfortunate action?</p>

  <p>A learned Frenchman, whom we shall have to quote freely in the immediately
    ensuing pages, does not venture to be more precise in reference to the
    meeting of Polo and Rusticiano than to say of the latter: “In 1298, being
    in durance in the Prison of Genoa, he there became acquainted with Marco
    Polo, whom the Genoese had deprived of his liberty <em>from motives equally
    unknown</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

  <p>To those who have no relish for biographies that round the meagre skeleton
    of authentic facts with a plump padding of what <em>might have been</em>, this
    sentence of Paulin Paris is quite refreshing in its stern limitation to
    positive knowledge. And certainly no contemporary authority has yet been
    found for the capture of our Traveller at Curzola. Still I think that the
    fact is beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

  <p>Ramusio’s biographical notices certainly contain many errors of detail; and
    some, such as the many years’ interval which he sets between the Battle of
    Curzola and Marco’s return, are errors which a very little trouble would
    have enabled him to eschew. But still it does seem reasonable to believe
    that the main fact of Marco’s command of a galley at Curzola, and capture
    there, was derived from a genuine tradition, if not from documents.</p>

  <p>Let us then turn to the words which close Rusticiano’s preamble (see
    <i>post</i>, <a href="#Page_2">p. 2</a>):—<span lang="fr">“Lequel (Messire Marc) puis demorant en le charthre de
    Jene, fist retraire toutes cestes chouses a Messire Rustacians de Pise que
    en celle meissme charthre estoit, au tens qu’il avoit 1298 anz que Jezu
    eut vesqui.”</span> These words are at least thoroughly consistent with Marco’s
    capture at Curzola, as regards both the position in which they present him,
    and the year in which he is thus presented.</p>

  <p>There is however another piece of evidence, though it is curiously indirect.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i54"><i>54</i></span></p>

  <p>The Dominican Friar Jacopo of Acqui was a contemporary of Polo’s, and was
    the author of a somewhat obscure Chronicle called <cite>Imago Mundi</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Now
    this Chronicle does contain mention of Marco’s capture in action by the
    Genoese, but attributes it to a different action from Curzola, and one
    fought at a time when Polo could not have been present. The passage runs as
    follows in a manuscript of the Ambrosian Library, according to an extract
    given by Baldelli Boni:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In the year of Christ MCCLXXXXVI, in the time of Pope Boniface VI.,
      of whom we have spoken above, a battle was fought in Arminia, at the
      place called Layaz, between xv. galleys of Genoese merchants and xxv.
      of Venetian merchants; and after a great fight the galleys of the
      Venetians were beaten, and (the crews) all slain or taken; and among
      them was taken Messer Marco the Venetian, who was in company with
      those merchants, and who was called <em>Milono</em>, which is as much as to
      say ‘a thousand thousand pounds,’ for so goes the phrase in Venice.
      So this Messer Marco Milono the Venetian, with the other Venetian
      prisoners, is carried off to the prison of Genoa, and there kept for
      a long time. This Messer Marco was a long time with his father and
      uncle in Tartary, and he there saw many things, and made much wealth,
      and also learned many things, for he was a man of ability. And so,
      being in prison at Genoa, he made a Book concerning the great wonders
      of the World, <i>i.e.</i>, concerning such of them as he had seen. And what
      he told in the Book was not as much as he had really seen, because
      of the tongues of detractors, who, being ready to impose their own
      lies on others, are over hasty to set down as lies what they in their
      perversity disbelieve, or do not understand. And because there are
      many great and strange things in that Book, which are reckoned past
      all credence, he was asked by his friends on his death-bed to correct
      the Book by removing everything that went beyond the facts. To which
      his reply was that he had not told <em>one-half</em> of what he had really
      seen!”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This statement regarding the capture of Marco <em>at the Battle of Ayas</em> is
    one which cannot be true, for we know that he did not reach Venice till
    1295, travelling from Persia by way of Trebizond and the Bosphorus, whilst
    the Battle of Ayas of which we have purposely given some detail, was
    fought in May, 1294. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i55"><i>55</i></span>The date <span class="allsmcap">MCCLXXXXVI</span> assigned to it in the preceding
    extract has given rise to some unprofitable discussion. Could that date
    be accepted, no doubt it would enable us also to accept this, the sole
    statement from the Traveller’s own age of the circumstances which brought
    him into a Genoese prison; it would enable us to place that imprisonment
    within a few months of his return from the East, and to extend its duration
    to three years, points which would thus accord better with the general
    tenor of Ramusio’s tradition than the capture of Curzola. But the matter
    is not open to such a solution. The date of the Battle of Ayas is not more
    doubtful than that of the Battle of the Nile. It is clearly stated by
    several independent chroniclers, and is carefully established in the Ballad
    that we have quoted above.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> We shall see repeatedly in the course of
    this Book how uncertain are the transcriptions of dates in Roman numerals,
    and in the present case the <span class="allsmcap">LXXXXVI</span> is as certainly a mistake for <span class="allsmcap">LXXXXIV</span>
    as is Boniface VI. in the same quotation a mistake for Boniface VIII.</p>

  <p>But though we cannot accept the statement that Polo was taken prisoner at
    <em>Ayas, in the spring of 1294</em>, we may accept the passage as evidence from
    a contemporary source that he was <em>taken prisoner in some sea-fight with
    the Genoese</em>, and thus admit it in corroboration of the Ramusian Tradition
    of his capture in a sea-fight at Curzola in 1298, which is perfectly
    consistent with all other facts in our possession.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_197" href="#FNanchor_197" class="label">[16]</a> In July 1294, a Council of Thirty decreed that galleys
      should be equipped by the richest families in proportion to their
      wealth. Among the families held to equip one galley each, or one
      galley among two or more, in this list, is the <span class="smcap">Ca’ Polo</span>. But
      this was before the return of the travellers from the East, and
      just after the battle of Ayas. (<cite>Romanin</cite>, ii. 332; this author
      misdates Ayas, however.) When a levy was required in Venice for
      any expedition the heads of each <em>contrada</em> divided the male
      inhabitants, between the ages of twenty and sixty, into groups of
      twelve each, called <em>duodene</em>. The dice were thrown to decide who
      should go first on service. He who went received five <em>lire</em> a month
      from the State, and one <em>lira</em> from each of his colleagues in the
      <em>duodena</em>. Hence his pay was sixteen <em>lire</em> a month, about 2<i>s.</i> a
      day in silver value, if these were <i lang="it">lire ai grossi</i>, or 1<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
      if <i lang="it">lire dei piccoli</i>. (See <cite>Romanin</cite>, ii. 393–394.)

      <p>Money on such occasions was frequently raised by what was called an
        <em>Estimo</em> or <em>Facion</em>, which was a force loan levied on the citizens
        in proportion to their estimated wealth; and for which they were

      his Son, fighting valiantly at the Forecastle, was shot by an Arrow
      in the Breast, and fell wounded to the Death; a Mishap whereat his
      Comrades were sorely shaken, and Fear came upon the whole Ship’s

      of his Country’s Service and his own Glory than of his Son, ran
      forward to the spot, loftily rebuked the agitated Crowd, and ordered
      his Son’s Body to be cast into the Deep, telling them for their

      1278. On this occasion is recorded a remarkable anticipation of
      the feats of American engineering: “As there was an ancient and

      thought a great pity that so fine a work should be destroyed. And

      through my friend Professor Henry Giglioli (to whose kindness I
      owe the transcript of the inscription just given), that a faint
      tradition exists as to the place of our traveller’s imprisonment.
      It is alleged to have been a massive building, standing between the
      <em>Grazie</em> and the Mole, and bearing the name of the <em>Malapaga</em>, which
      is now a barrack for Doganieri, but continued till comparatively
      recent times to be used as a civil prison. “It is certain,” says my
      informant, “that men of fame in arms who had fallen into the power
      of the Genoese <em>were</em> imprisoned there, and among others is recorded
      the name of the Corsican Giudice dalla Rocca and Lord of Cinarca,
      who died there in 1312;” a date so near that of Marco’s imprisonment
      as to give some interest to the hypothesis, slender as are its
      grounds. Another Genoese, however, indicates as the scene of Marco’s
      captivity certain old prisons near the Old Arsenal, in a site still
      known as the <em>Vico degli Schiavi</em>. (<cite>Celesia, Dante in Liguria</cite>,
      1865, p. 43.) [Was not the place of Polo’s captivity the basement of
      the <em>Palazzo del Capitan del Popolo</em>, afterwards <em>Palazzo del Comune
      al Mare</em>, where the Customs (<em>Dogana</em>) had their office, and from
      the 15th century the <em>Casa</em> or <em>Palazzo di S. Giorgio?</em>—H.&nbsp;C.]</div>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_VIIi">VII. <span class="smcap">Rusticiano or Rustichello of Pisa, Marco Polo’s Fellow-Prisoner at
    Genoa, the Scribe who wrote down the Travels.</span></h4>

  <p>38. We have now to say something of that Rusticiano to whom all who value
    Polo’s book are so much indebted.</p>

  <p>The relations between Genoa and Pisa had long been so <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i56"><i>56</i></span>hostile that it was
    only too natural in 1298 to find a Pisan in the gaol of Genoa.<span class="sidenote">Rusticiano,
    perhaps a prisoner from Meloria.</span> An unhappy
    multitude of such prisoners had been carried thither fourteen years before,
    and the survivors still lingered there in vastly dwindled numbers. In
    the summer of 1284 was fought the battle from which Pisa had to date the
    commencement of her long decay. In July of that year the Pisans, at a time
    when the Genoese had no fleet in their own immediate waters, had advanced
    to the very port of Genoa and shot their defiance into the proud city in
    the form of silver-headed arrows, and stones belted with scarlet.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They
    had to pay dearly for this insult. The Genoese, recalling their cruisers,
    speedily mustered a fleet of eighty-eight galleys, which were placed under
    the command of another of that illustrious House of Doria, the Scipios of
    Genoa as they have been called, Uberto, the elder brother of Lamba. Lamba
    himself with his six sons, and another brother, was in the fleet, whilst
    the whole number of Dorias who fought in the ensuing action amounted to
    250, most of them on board one great galley bearing the name of the family
    patron, St. Matthew.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <p>The Pisans, more than one-fourth inferior in strength, came out boldly,
    and the battle was fought off the Porto Pisano, in fact close in front of
    Leghorn, where a lighthouse on a remarkable arched basement still marks
    the islet of <span class="smcap">Meloria</span>, whence the battle got its name. The day was the 6th
    of August, the feast of St. Sixtus, a day memorable in the Pisan Fasti
    for several great victories. But on this occasion the defeat of Pisa was
    overwhelming. Forty of their galleys were taken or sunk, and upwards of
    9000 prisoners carried to Genoa. In fact so vast a sweep was made of the
    flower of Pisan manhood that it was a common saying then: “<i lang="it">Che vuol veder
    Pisa, vada a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i57"><i>57</i></span>Genova</i>!” Many noble ladies of Pisa went in large companies
    on foot to Genoa to seek their husbands or kinsmen: “And when they made
    enquiry of the Keepers of the Prisons, the reply would be, ‘Yesterday there
    died thirty of them, to-day there have died forty; all of whom we have cast
    into the sea; and so it is daily.’”<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <div class="figright illowp48" id="f057">
    <img class="w100" src="images/f057.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Seal of the Pisan Prisoners.</div>
  </div>

  <p>A body of prisoners so numerous and important naturally exerted themselves
    in the cause of peace, and through their efforts, after many months of
    negotiation, a formal peace was signed (15th April, 1288). But through the
    influence, as was alleged, of Count Ugolino (Dante’s) who was then in power
    at Pisa, the peace became abortive; war almost immediately recommenced, and
    the prisoners had no release.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And, when the 6000 or 7000 Venetians were
    thrown into the prisons of Genoa in October 1298, they would find there
    the scanty surviving remnant of the Pisan Prisoners of Meloria, and would
    gather from them dismal forebodings of the fate before them.</p>

  <p>It is a fair conjecture that to that remnant Rusticiano of Pisa may have
    belonged.</p>

  <p>We have seen Ramusio’s representation of the kindness shown to Marco
    during his imprisonment by a certain Genoese gentleman who also assisted
    him to reduce his travels to writing. We may be certain that this Genoese
    gentleman is only a distorted image of Rusticiano, the Pisan prisoner
    in the gaol of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i58"><i>58</i></span>Genoa, whose name and part in the history of his hero’s
    book Ramusio so strangely ignores. Yet patriotic Genoese writers in our
    own times have striven to determine the identity of this their imaginary
    countryman!<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>39. Who, then, was Rusticiano, or, as the name actually is read in the
    oldest type of MS., “Messire Rustacians de Pise”?</p>

  <p><span class="sidenote">Rusticiano, a person known from other sources.</span>Our knowledge of him is but scanty. Still something is known of him besides
    the few words concluding his preamble to our Traveller’s Book, which you
    may read at <a href="#Page_1">pp. 1–2</a> of the body of this volume.</p>

  <p>In Sir Walter Scott’s “Essay on Romance,” when he speaks of the new mould
    in which the subjects of the old metrical stories were cast by the school
    of prose romancers which arose in the 13th century, we find the following
    words:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Whatever fragments or shadows of true history may yet remain hidden
      under the mass of accumulated fable which had been heaped upon them
      during successive ages, must undoubtedly be sought in the metrical
      romances.... But those prose authors who wrote under the imaginary
      names of <span class="smcap">Rusticien de Pise</span>, Robert de Borron, and the like, usually
      seized upon the subject of some old minstrel; and recomposing the
      whole narrative after their own fashion, with additional character
      and adventure, totally obliterated in that operation any shades which
      remained of the original and probably authentic tradition,” &amp;c.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Evidently, therefore, Sir Walter regarded Rustician of Pisa as a person
    belonging to the same ghostly company as his own Cleishbothams and
    Dryasdusts. But in this we see that he was wrong.</p>

  <p>In the great Paris Library and elsewhere there are manuscript volumes
    containing the stories of the Round Table abridged and somewhat clumsily
    combined from the various Prose Romances of that cycle, such as <em>Sir
    Tristan</em>, <em>Lancelot</em>, <em>Palamedes</em>, <em>Giron le Courtois</em>, &amp;c., which had been
    composed, it would seem, by various Anglo-French gentlemen at the court of
    Henry III., styled, or styling themselves, Gasses le Blunt, Luces du Gast,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i59"><i>59</i></span>Robert de Borron, and Hélis de Borron. And these abridgments or recasts are
    professedly the work of <cite lang="fr">Le Maistre Rusticien de Pise</cite>. Several of them
    were printed at Paris in the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th
    centuries as the works of Rusticien de Pise; and as the preambles and the
    like, especially in the form presented in those printed editions, appear
    to be due sometimes to the original composers (as Robert and Hélis de
    Borron) and sometimes to Rusticien de Pise the recaster, there would seem
    to have been a good deal of confusion made in regard to their respective
    personalities.</p>

  <p>From a preamble to one of those compilations which undoubtedly belongs to
    Rustician, and which we shall quote at length by and bye, we learn that
    Master Rustician “translated” (or perhaps <em>transferred?</em>) his compilation
    from a book belonging to King Edward of England, at the time when that
    prince went beyond seas to recover the Holy Sepulchre. Now Prince Edward
    started for the Holy Land in 1270, spent the winter of that year in Sicily,
    and arrived in Palestine in May 1271. He quitted it again in August,
    1272, and passed again by Sicily, where in January, 1273, he heard of his
    father’s death and his own consequent accession. Paulin Paris supposes that
    Rustician was attached to the Sicilian Court of Charles of Anjou, and that
    Edward “may have deposited with that king the Romances of the Round Table,
    of which all the world was talking, but the manuscripts of which were still
    very rare, especially those of the work of Helye de Borron<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> ... whether
    by order, or only with permission of the King of Sicily, our Rustician made
    haste to read, abridge, and re-arrange the whole, and when Edward returned
    to Sicily he recovered possession of the book from which the indefatigable
    Pisan had extracted the contents.”</p>

  <p>But this I believe is, in so far as it passes the facts stated in
    Rustician’s own preamble, pure hypothesis, for nothing is cited that
    connects Rustician with the King of Sicily. And if there be not some
    such confusion of personality as we have alluded to, in another of the
    preambles, which is quoted by Dunlop as an utterance of Rustician’s, that
    personage would seem to claim to have been a comrade in arms of the two
    de Borrons. We <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i60"><i>60</i></span>might, therefore, conjecture that Rustician himself had
    accompanied Prince Edward to Syria.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>40. Rustician’s literary work appears from the extracts and remarks of
    Paulin Paris to be that of an industrious simple man,<span class="sidenote">Character of Rustician’s Romance compilations.</span> without method or
    much judgment. “The haste with which he worked is too perceptible; the
    adventures are told without connection; you find long stories of Tristan
    followed by adventures of his father Meliadus.” For the latter derangement
    of historical sequence we find a quaint and ingenuous apology offered in
    Rustician’s epilogue to Giron le Courtois:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p lang="fr">“Cy fine le Maistre Rusticien de Pise son conte en louant et
      regraciant le Père le Filz et le Saint Esperit, et ung mesme Dieu,
      Filz de la Benoiste Vierge Marie, de ce qu’il m’a doné grace, sens,
      force, et mémoire, temps et lieu, de me mener à fin de si haulte et
      si noble matière come ceste-cy dont j’ay traicté les faiz et proesses
      recitez et recordez à mon livre. Et se aucun me demandoit pour quoy
      j’ay parlé de Tristan avant que de son père le Roy Meliadus, je
      respons que ma matière n’estoist pas congneue. Car je ne puis pas
      scavoir tout, ne mettre toutes mes paroles par ordre. Et ainsi fine
      mon conte. Amen.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In a passage of these compilations the Emperor Charlemagne is asked whether
    in his judgment King Meliadus or his son Tristan were the better man? The
    Emperor’s answer is: “I should say that the King Meliadus was the better
    man, and I will tell you why I say so. As far as I can see, everything that
    Tristan did was done for Love, and his great feats would never have been
    done but under the constraint of Love, which was his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i61"><i>61</i></span>spur and goad. Now
    that never can be said of King Meliadus! For what deeds he did, he did them
    not by dint of Love, but by dint of his strong right arm. Purely out of
    his own goodness he did good, and not by constraint of Love.” “It will be
    seen,” remarks on this Paulin Paris, “that we are here a long way removed
    from the ordinary principles of Round Table Romances. And one thing besides
    will be manifest, viz., that Rusticien de Pise was no Frenchman!”<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

  <p>The same discretion is shown even more prominently in a passage of one
    of his compilations, which contains the romances of Arthur, Gyron, and
    Meliadus (No. 6975—see last note but one):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“No doubt,” Rustician says, “other books tell the story of the Queen
      Ginevra and Lancelot differently from this; and there were certain
      passages between them of which the Master, in his concern for the honour
      of both those personages, will say not a word.” Alas, says the French
      Bibliographer, that the copy of Lancelot, which fell into the hands of poor
      Francesca of Rimini, was not one of those <em>expurgated</em> by our worthy friend
      Rustician!<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>41. A question may still occur to an attentive reader as to the identity
    of this Romance-compiler Rusticien de Pise with the Messire <em>Rustacians
    de Pise</em>, <span class="sidenote">Identity of the Romance Compiler with Polo’s fellow-prisoner.</span>of a solitary MS. of Polo’s work (though the oldest and most
    authentic), a name which appears in other copies as <em>Rusta Pisan</em>, <em>Rasta
    Pysan</em>, <em>Rustichelus Civis Pisanus</em>, <em>Rustico</em>, <em>Restazio da Pisa</em>, <em>Stazio da
    Pisa</em>, and who is stated in the preamble to have acted as the Traveller’s
    scribe at Genoa.</p>

  <p>M. Pauthier indeed<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> asserts that the French of the MS. Romances of
    Rusticien de Pise is of the same barbarous character as that of the early
    French MS. of Polo’s Book to which we have just alluded, and which we shall
    show to be the nearest presentation of the work as originally dictated by
    the Traveller. The language of the latter MS. is so peculiar that this
    would be almost perfect evidence of the identity of the writers, if it were
    really the fact. A cursory inspection which I have made of two of those
    MSS. in Paris, and the extracts which I have given <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i62"><i>62</i></span>and am about to give,
    do not, however, by any means support M. Pauthier’s view. Nor would that
    view be consistent with the judgment of so competent an authority as Paulin
    Paris, implied in his calling Rustician a <i lang="fr">nom recommandable</i> in old French
    literature, and his speaking of him as “versed in the secrets of the French
    Romance Tongue.”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In fact the difference of language in the two cases
    would really be a difficulty in the way of identification, if there were
    room for doubt. This, however, Paulin Paris seems to have excluded finally,
    by calling attention to the peculiar formula of preamble which is common to
    the Book of Marco Polo and to one of the Romance compilations of Rusticien
    de Pise.</p>

  <p>The former will be found in English at <a href="#Page_1">pp. 1, 2</a>, of our Translation; but
    we give a part of the original below<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> for comparison with the preamble
    to the Romances of Meliadus, Tristan, and Lancelot, as taken from MS. 6961
    (Fr. 340) of the Paris Library:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p lang="fr">“<em>Seigneurs Empereurs et Princes, Ducs et Contes et Barons et

  <p>“Certainly,” Paulin Paris observes, “there is a singular <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i63"><i>63</i></span>analogy between
    these two prefaces. And it must be remarked that the formula is not an
    ordinary one with translators, compilers, or authors of the 13th and 14th
    centuries. Perhaps you would not find a single other example of it.”<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

  <p>This seems to place beyond question the identity of the Romance-compiler of
    Prince Edward’s suite in 1270, and the Prisoner of Genoa in 1298.</p>

  <p>42. In Dunlop’s History of Fiction a passage is quoted from the preamble
    of <cite>Meliadus</cite>, as set forth in the Paris printed edition of 1528,
    <span class="sidenote">Further particulars concerning Rustician.</span> which
    gives us to understand that Rusticien de Pise had received as a reward for
    some of his compositions from King Henry III. the prodigal gift of two
    <em>chateaux</em>. I gather, however, from passages in the work of Paulin Paris
    that this must certainly be one of those confusions of persons to which I
    have referred before, and that the recipient of the chateaux was in reality
    Helye de Borron, the author of some of the originals which Rustician
    manipulated.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This supposed incident in Rustician’s scanty history must
    therefore be given up.</p>

  <p>We call this worthy <em>Rustician</em> or <em>Rusticiano</em>, as the nearest probable
    representation in Italian form of the <em>Rusticien</em> of the Round-Table
    MSS. and the <em>Rustacians</em> of the old text of Polo. But it is highly
    probable that his real name was <em>Rustichello</em>, as is suggested by the form
    <em>Rustichelus</em> in the early Latin version published by the <cite>Société de
    Géographie</cite>. The change of one liquid for another never goes for much in
    Italy,<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and Rustichello might easily Gallicize himself as Rusticien. In
    a very long list of Pisan officials during the Middle Ages I find several
    bearing the name of <em>Rustichello</em> or <em>Rustichelli</em>, but no <em>Rusticiano</em> or
    <em>Rustigiano</em>.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <p>Respecting him we have only to add that the peace between Genoa and Venice
    was speedily followed by a treaty between Genoa and Pisa. On the 31st July,
    1299, a truce for twenty-five years was signed between those two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i64"><i>64</i></span>Republics.
    It was a very different matter from that between Genoa and Venice, and
    contained much that was humiliating and detrimental to Pisa. But it
    embraced the release of prisoners; and those of Meloria, reduced it is said
    to less than one tithe of their original number, had their liberty at last.
    Among the prisoners then released no doubt Rustician was one. But we hear
    of him no more.</p>

      <p><span lang="fr">“Aussi Luces du Gau (Gas) translata en langue Françoise une partie

        etc. (<cite>Liebrecht’s Dunlop</cite>, p. 80.) If this passage be authentic
        it would set beyond doubt the age of the de Borrons and the other
        writers of Anglo-French Round Table Romances, who are placed by the
        <cite>Hist. Littéraire de la France</cite>, and apparently by Fr. Michel, under
        Henry II. I have no means of pursuing the matter, and have preferred
        to follow Paulin Paris, who places them under Henry III. I notice,
        moreover, that the <cite>Hist. Litt.</cite> (xv. p. 498) puts not only the de
        Borrons but Rustician himself under Henry II.; and, as the last view
        is certainly an error, the first is probably so too.</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_VIIIi">VIII. <span class="smcap">Notices of Marco Polo’s History, after the Termination of his
    Imprisonment at Genoa.</span></h4>

  <p>43. A few very disconnected notices are all that can be collected of matter
    properly biographical in relation to the quarter <span class="sidenote">Death of Marco’s Father before 1300. Will of his brother Maffeo.</span>century during which Marco
    Polo survived the Genoese captivity.</p>

  <p>We have seen that he would probably reach Venice in the course of August,
    1299. Whether he found his aged father alive is not known; but we know at
    least that a year later (31st August, 1300) Messer Nicolo was no longer in life.</p>

  <p>This we learn from the Will of the younger Maffeo, Marco’s brother, which
    bears the date just named, and of which we give an abstract below.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It
    seems to imply strong regard for the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i65"><i>65</i></span>testator’s brother Marco, who is made
    inheritor of the bulk of the property, failing the possible birth of a son.
    I have already indicated some conjectural deductions from this document.
    I may add that the terms of the second clause, as quoted in the note,
    seem to me to throw considerable doubt on the genealogy which bestows a
    large family of sons upon this brother Maffeo. If he lived to have such a
    family it seems improbable that the draft which he thus left in the hands
    of a notary, to be converted into a Will in the event of his death (a
    curious example of the validity attaching to all acts of notaries in those
    days), should never have been superseded, but should actually have been
    so converted after his death, as the existence of the parchment <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i66"><i>66</i></span>seems to
    prove. But for this circumstance we might suppose the Marcolino mentioned
    in the ensuing paragraph to have been a son of the younger Maffeo.</p>

  <p>Messer Maffeo, the uncle, was, we see, alive at this time. We do not know
    the year of his death. But it is alluded to by Friar Pipino in the Preamble
    to his Translation of the Book, supposed to have been executed about
    1315–1320; and we learn from a document in the Venetian archives (see <a href="#Page_i77">p.
    <i>77</i></a>) that it must have been previous to 1318, and subsequent to February
    1309, the date of his last Will. The Will itself is not known to be extant,
    but from the reference to it in this document we learn that he left 1000
    <i>lire</i> of public debt<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (<em>?&nbsp;imprestitorum</em>) to a certain Marco Polo,
    called <em>Marcolino</em>. The relationship of this Marco to old Maffeo is not
    stated, but we may suspect him to have been an illegitimate son. [Marcolino
    was a son of Nicolo, son of Marco the Elder; see vol. ii., <cite>Calendar</cite>, No.
    6.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <p>44. In 1302 occurs what was at first supposed to be a glimpse of Marco as
    a citizen, slight and quaint enough; <span class="sidenote">Documentary notices of Polo at this time. The sobriquet of
    Milione.</span>being a resolution on the Books of
    the Great Council to exempt the respectable Marco Polo from the penalty
    incurred by him on account of the omission to have his water-pipe duly
    inspected. But since our Marco’s claims to the designation of <em>Nobilis
    Vir</em> have been established, there is a doubt whether the <em>providus vir</em>
    or <em>prud’-homme</em> here spoken of may not have been rather his namesake
    Marco Polo of Cannareggio or S. Geremia, of whose existence we learn from
    another entry of the same year.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is, however, possible <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i67"><i>67</i></span>that Marco the
    Traveller was called to the Great Council <em>after</em> the date of the document
    in question.</p>

  <p>We have seen that the Traveller, and after him his House and his Book,
    acquired from his contemporaries the surname, or nickname rather, of <em>Il
    Milione</em>. Different writers have given different explanations of the origin
    of this name; some, beginning with his contemporary Fra Jacopo d’Acqui,
    (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_i54">p. <i>54</i></a>), ascribing it to the family’s having brought home a fortune
    of a million of <i>lire</i>, in fact to their being <em>millionaires</em>. This is the
    explanation followed by Sansovino, Marco Barbaro, Coronelli, and others.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
    More far-fetched is that of Fontanini, who supposes the name to have been
    given to the Book as containing a great number of stories, like the <cite>Cento
    Novelle</cite> or the <cite>Thousand and One Nights!</cite> But there can be no doubt that
    Ramusio’s is the true, as it is the natural, explanation; and that the
    name was bestowed on Marco by the young wits of his native city, because
    of his frequent use of a word which appears to have been then unusual, in
    his attempts to convey an idea of the vast wealth and magnificence of the
    Kaan’s Treasury and Court.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Ramusio has told
    us (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_i6">p. <i>6</i></a>) that he had seen Marco
    styled by this sobriquet in the Books of the Signory; and it is pleasant
    to be able to confirm this by the next document which we cite. This is
    an extract from the Books of the Great Council under 10th April, 1305,
    condoning the offence of a certain Bonocio of Mestre in smuggling wine, for
    whose penalty one of the sureties had been the <span class="smcap">Nobilis Vir Marchus Paulo
    Milioni</span>.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>It is alleged that long after our Traveller’s death there was always, in
    the Venetian Masques, one individual who assumed the character of Marco
    Milioni, and told Munchausenlike stories <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i68"><i>68</i></span>to divert the vulgar. Such, if
    this be true, was the honour of our prophet among the populace of his own
    country.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

  <p>45. A little later we hear of Marco once more, as presenting a copy of his
    Book to a noble Frenchman in the service of Charles of Valois.</p>

  <p>This Prince, brother of Philip the Fair, in 1301 had married Catharine,
    daughter and heiress of Philip de Courtenay, titular Emperor of<span class="sidenote">Polo’s relations with Thibault de Cepoy.</span>
    Constantinople, and on the strength of this marriage had at a later date
    set up his own claim to the Empire of the East. To this he was prompted by
    Pope Clement V., who in the beginning of 1306 wrote to Venice, stimulating
    that Government to take part in the enterprise. In the same year, Charles
    and his wife sent as their envoys to Venice, in connection with this
    matter, a noble knight called <span class="smcap">Thibault de Cepoy</span>, along with an ecclesiastic
    of Chartres called Pierre le Riche, and these two succeeded in executing a
    treaty of alliance with Venice, of which the original, dated 14th December,
    1306, exists at Paris. Thibault de Cepoy eventually went on to Greece with
    a squadron of Venetian Galleys, but accomplished nothing of moment, and
    returned to his master in 1310.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/f068.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Miracle of S. Lorenzo.</div>
  </div>

  <p>During the stay of Thibault at Venice he seems to have made acquaintance
    with Marco Polo, and to have received from him a copy of his Book. This is
    recorded in a curious note which appears on two existing MSS. of Polo’s
    Book, viz., that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i69"><i>69</i></span>of the Paris Library (10,270 or Fr. 5649), and that of
    Bern, which is substantially identical in its text with the former, and is,
    as I believe, a copy of it.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The note runs as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Here you have the Book of which My Lord <span class="smcap">Thiebault</span>, Knight and <span class="smcap">Lord
      of Cepoy</span>, (whom may God assoil!) requested a copy from <span class="smcap">Sire Marc Pol</span>,
      Burgess and Resident of the City of Venice. And the said Sire Marc
      Pol, being a very honourable Person, of high character and respect
      in many countries, because of his desire that what he had witnessed
      should be known throughout the World, and also for the honour and
      reverence he bore to the most excellent and puissant Prince my Lord
      <span class="smcap">Charles</span>, Son of the King of France and <span class="smcap">Count of Valois</span>, gave and
      presented to the aforesaid Lord of Cepoy the first copy (that was
      taken) of his said Book after he had made the same. And very pleasing
      it was to him that his Book should be carried to the noble country of
      France and there made known by so worthy a gentleman. And from that
      copy which the said Messire Thibault, Sire de Cepoy above-named, did
      carry into France, Messire John, who was his eldest son and is the
      present Sire de Cepoy,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> after his Father’s decease did have a copy
      made, and that very first copy that was made of the Book after its
      being carried into France he did present to his very dear and dread
      Lord Monseigneur de Valois. Thereafter he gave copies of it to such
      of his friends as asked for them.</p>

    <p>“And the copy above-mentioned was presented by the said Sire Marc
      Pol to the said Lord de Cepoy when the latter went to Venice, on the
      part of Monseigneur de Valois and of Madame the Empress his wife, as
      Vicar General for them both in all the Territories of the Empire of
      Constantinople. And this happened in the year of the Incarnation of
      our Lord Jesus Christ one thousand three hundred and seven, and in
      the month of August.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Of the bearings of this memorandum on the literary history of Polo’s Book
    we shall speak in a following section.</p>

  <p>46. When Marco married we have not been able to ascertain, but it was no
    doubt early in the 14th century, for in 1324, we find that he had two<span class="sidenote">His marriage and his daughters. Marco as a merchant.</span>
    married daughters besides one unmarried. His wife’s Christian name was
    <em>Donata</em>, but of her family we have as yet found no assurance. I suspect,
    however, that her name may have been Loredano (<i>vide infra</i>, <a href="#Page_i77">p. <i>77</i></a>).</p>

  <p>Under 1311 we find a document which is of considerable interest, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i70"><i>70</i></span>because it
    is the only one yet discovered which exhibits Marco under the aspect of a
    practical trader. It is the judgment of the Court of Requests upon a suit
    brought by the <span class="smcap">Noble Marco Polo</span> of the parish of S. Giovanni Grisostomo
    against one Paulo Girardo of S. Apollinare. It appears that Marco had
    entrusted to the latter as a commission agent for sale, on an agreement
    for half profits, a pound and a half of musk, priced at six <em>lire of
    grossi</em> (about 22<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> in value of silver) the pound. Girardo had
    sold half-a-pound at that rate, and the remaining pound which he brought
    back was deficient of a <em>saggio</em>, or, one-sixth of an ounce, but he had
    accounted for neither the sale nor the deficiency. Hence Marco sues him for
    three <em>lire of Grossi</em>, the price of the half-pound sold, and for twenty
    <em>grossi</em> as the value of the saggio. And the Judges cast the defendant in
    the amount with costs, and the penalty of imprisonment in the common gaol
    of Venice if the amounts were not paid within a suitable term.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

  <p>Again in May, 1323, probably within a year of his death, Ser Marco appears
    (perhaps only by attorney), before the Doge and his judicial examiners,
    to obtain a decision respecting a question touching the rights to certain
    stairs and porticoes in contact with his own house property, and that
    obtained from his wife, in S. Giovanni Grisostomo. To this allusion has
    been already made (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_i31">p. <i>31</i></a>).</p>

  <p>47. We catch sight of our Traveller only once more. It is on the 9th of<span class="sidenote">Marco Polo’s Last Will and Death.</span>
    January, 1324; he is labouring with disease, under which he is sinking day
    by day; and he has sent for Giovanni Giustiniani, Priest of S. Proculo and
    Notary, to make his Last Will and Testament. It runs thus:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="center">“<span class="smcap">In the Name of the Eternal God Amen!</span></div>

    <p>“In the year from the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ 1323, on
      the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i71"><i>71</i></span>9th day of the month of January, in the first half of the 7th
      Indiction,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> at Rialto.</p>

    <p>“It is the counsel of Divine Inspiration as well as the judgment
      of a provident mind that every man should take thought to make a
      disposition of his property before death become imminent, lest in the
      end it should remain without any disposition:</p>

    <p>“Wherefore I <span class="smcap">Marcus Paulo</span> of the parish of St. John Chrysostom,
      finding myself to grow daily feebler through bodily ailment, but
      being by the grace of God of a sound mind, and of senses and judgment
      unimpaired, have sent for <span class="smcap">John Giustiniani</span>, Priest of S. Proculo and
      Notary, and have instructed him to draw out in complete form this my
      Testament:</p>

    <p>“Whereby I constitute as my Trustees <span class="smcap">Donata</span> my beloved wife, and my

    <p>“First of all: I will and direct that the proper Tithe be paid.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
      And over and above the said tithe I direct that 2000 <i>lire</i> of Venice
      denari be distributed as follows:<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

    <p>“<i>Viz.</i>, 20 <i>soldi</i> of Venice <em>grossi</em> to the Monastery of St. Lawrence

    </p>

    <p>“Also I bequeath 20 <i>soldi</i> of Venetian grossi to the Priest Giovanni
      Giustiniani the Notary, for his trouble about this my Will, and in
      order that he may pray the Lord in my behalf.</p>

    <p>“Also I release <span class="smcap">Peter</span> the Tartar, my servant, from all bondage, as
      completely as I pray God to release mine own soul from all sin and

      of my trustees.</p>

    <p>“Out of my remaining property I bequeath to the aforesaid Donata, my

    <p>“And all my other property movable and immovable that has not been

  </blockquote>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i74"><i>74</i></span></p>

  <p>We do not know, as has been said, how long Marco survived the making of
    this will, but we know, from a scanty series of documents commencing in
    June of the following year (1325), that he had <em>then</em> been some time
    dead.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

  <p>48. He was buried, no doubt, according to his declared wish, in the
    Church of S. Lorenzo; <span class="sidenote">Place of Sepulture. Professed Portraits of Polo.</span>and indeed Sansovino bears testimony to the fact
    in a confused notice of our Traveller.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> But there does not seem to
    have been any monument to Marco, though the sarcophagus which had been
    erected to his father Nicolo, by his own filial care, existed till near
    the end of the 16th century in the porch or corridor leading to the old
    Church of S. Lorenzo, and bore the inscription: “<span class="smcap" lang="la">Sepultura Domini Nicolai
    Paulo de contrata S. Ioannis Grisostemi</span>.” The church was renewed from its
    foundations in 1592, and then, probably, the sarcophagus was cast aside and
    lost, and with it all certainty as to the position of the tomb.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

  <p>There is no portrait of Marco Polo in existence with any claim to
    authenticity. The quaint figure which we give in the <cite>Bibliography</cite>, vol.
    ii. p. 555, extracted from the earliest printed edition of his book, can
    certainly make no such pretension. The oldest one after this is probably
    a picture in the collection of Monsignor Badia at Rome, of which I am
    now able, by the owner’s courtesy, to give a copy. It is set down in the
    catalogue to Titian, but is probably a work of 1600, or thereabouts, to
    which the aspect and costume belong. It is inscribed “<i lang="la">Marcus Polvs Venetvs
    Totivs Orbis et Indie Peregrator Primus.</i>” Its history unfortunately cannot
    be traced, but I believe it came from a collection at Urbino. A marble
    statue was erected in his honour by a family at Venice in the 17th century,
    and is still to be seen in the Palazzo Morosini-Gattemburg in the Campo S.
    Stefano in that city. The medallion portrait on the wall of the <i lang="it">Sala dello
    Scudo</i> in the ducal palace, and which was engraved in Bettom’s “Collection
    of Portraits of Illustrious Italians,” is a work of imagination painted
    by Francesco Griselini in 1761.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> From this, however, was taken the
    medal by Fabris, which was struck in 1847 in honour of the last meeting of
    the Italian Congresso Scientifico; and from the medal again is copied, I
    believe, the elegant woodcut which adorns the introduction to M. Pauthier’s
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i76"><i>76</i></span>edition, though without any information as to its history. A handsome bust,
    by Augusto Gamba, has lately been placed among the illustrious Venetians in
    the inner arcade of the Ducal Palace.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> There is also a mosaic portrait
    of Polo, opposite the similar portrait of Columbus in the Municipio at Genoa.</p>

  <p>49. From the short series of documents recently alluded to,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> we gather
    all that we know of the remaining history of Marco Polo’s immediate family.
    <span class="sidenote">Further History of the Polo Family.</span>
    We have seen in his will an indication that the two elder daughters,
    Fantina and Bellela, were married before his death. In 1333 we find the
    youngest, Moreta, also a married woman, and Bellela deceased. In 1336 we
    find that their mother Donata had died in the interval. We learn, too, that
    Fantina’s husband was <span class="smcap">Marco Bragadino</span>, and Moreta’s, <span class="smcap">Ranuzzo Dolfino</span>.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
    The name of Bellela’s husband does not appear.</p>

  <p>Fantina’s husband is probably the Marco Bragadino, son of Pietro, who in
    1346 is mentioned to have been sent as Provveditore-Generale to act against
    the Patriarch of Acquileia.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And in 1379 we find Donna Fantina herself,
    presumably in widowhood, assessed as a resident of S. Giovanni Grisostomo,
    on the <i lang="it">Estimo</i> or forced loan for the Genoese war, at 1300 <i>lire</i>, whilst
    Pietro Bragadino of the same parish—her son as I imagine—is assessed at
    1500 <i>lire</i>.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> [See vol. ii., <cite>Calendar</cite>.]</p>

  <p>The documents show a few other incidents which may be briefly noted. In
    1326 we have the record of a charge against one Zanino Grioni for insulting
    Donna Moreta in the Campo of San Vitale; a misdemeanour punished by the
    Council of Forty with two months’ imprisonment.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp85" id="f076">
    <img class="w100" src="images/f076.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Mosaic Portrait of Marco Polo at Genoa.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i77"><i>77</i></span></p>

  <p>In March, 1328, Marco Polo, called Marcolino, of St. John Chrysostom (see
    <a href="#Page_i66">p. <i>66</i></a>), represents before the <i lang="it">Domini Advocatores</i> of the Republic that
    certain <i lang="it">imprestita</i> that had belonged to the late Maffeo Polo the Elder,
    had been alienated and transferred in May 1318, by the late Marco Polo of
    St. John Chrysostom and since his death by his heirs, without regard to the
    rights of the said Marcolino, to whom the said Messer Maffeo had bequeathed
    1000 <i>lire</i> by his will executed on 6th February, 1308 (<i>i.e.</i> 1309). The
    Advocatores find that the transfer was to that extent unjust and improper,
    and they order that to the same extent it should be revoked and annulled.
    Two months later the Lady Donata makes rather an unpleasant figure before
    the Council of Forty. It would seem that on the claim of Messer Bertuccio
    Quirino a mandate of sequestration had been issued by the Court of Requests
    affecting certain articles in the Ca’ Polo; including two bags of money
    which had been tied and sealed, but left in custody of the Lady Donata.
    The sum so sealed was about 80 <i>lire</i> of grossi (300<i>l.</i> in silver value),
    but when opened only 45 <i>lire</i> and 22 <i>grossi</i> (about 170<i>l.</i>) were found
    therein, and the Lady was accused of abstracting the balance <i lang="it">non bono
    modo</i>. Probably she acted, as ladies sometimes do, on a strong sense of
    her own rights, and a weak sense of the claims of law. But the Council
    pronounced against her, ordering restitution, and a fine of 200 <i>lire</i> over
    and above “<i lang="la">ut ceteris transeat in exemplum.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

  <p>It will have been seen that there is nothing in the amounts mentioned in
    Marco’s will to bear out the large reports as to his wealth, though at the
    same time there is no positive ground for a deduction to the contrary.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

  <p>The mention in two of the documents of Agnes Loredano as the sister of the
    Lady Donata suggests that the latter may have belonged to the Loredano
    family, but as it does not appear whether Agnes was maid or wife this
    remains uncertain.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i78"><i>78</i></span></p>

  <p>Respecting the further history of the family there is nothing certain,
    nor can we give unhesitating faith to Ramusio’s statement that the last
    male descendant of the Polos of S. Giovanni Grisostomo was Marco, who died
    Castellano of Verona in 1417 (according to others, 1418, or 1425),<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and
    that the family property then passed to Maria (or <em>Anna</em>, as she is styled
    in a MS. statement furnished to me from Venice), who was married in 1401 to
    Benedetto Cornaro, and again in 1414 to Azzo Trevisan. Her descendant in
    the fourth generation by the latter was Marc Antonio Trevisano,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> who was
    chosen Doge in 1553.</p>

    <img class="w100" src="images/f078w.jpg" alt="" />
  </div>
  <div class="caption">Arms of the Trevisan family.</div>

  <p>The genealogy recorded by Marco Barbaro, as drawn up from documents by
    Ramusio, makes the Castellano of Verona a grandson of our Marco by a son
    Maffeo, whom we may safely pronounce not to have existed, and makes Maria
    the daughter of Maffeo, Marco’s brother—that is to say, makes a lady
    marry in 1414 and have children, whose father was born in 1271 at the
    very latest! The genealogy is given in several other ways, but as I have
    satisfied myself that they all (except perhaps this of Barbaro’s, which we
    see to be otherwise erroneous) confound together the two distinct families
    of Polo of S. Geremia and Polo of S. Giov. Grisostomo, I reserve my faith,
    and abstain from presenting them. Assuming that the Marco or Marcolino
    Polo, spoken of in the preceding page, was a near relation (as is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i79"><i>79</i></span>probable,
    though perhaps an illegitimate one), he is the only male descendant of old
    Andrea of San Felice whom we can indicate as having survived Marco himself;
    and from a study of the links in the professed genealogies I think it
    not unlikely that both Marco the Castellano of Verona and Maria Trevisan
    belonged to the branch of S. Geremia.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> [See vol. ii., <cite>App. C</cite>, p. 510.]</p>

      <a id="Footnote_232" href="#FNanchor_232" class="label">[1]</a> 1. The Will is made in prospect of his voyage to Crete.

      <p>2. He had drafted his will with his own hand, sealed the draft, and
        made it over to Pietro Pagano, priest of S. Felice and Notary, to
        draw out a formal testament in faithful accordance therewith in case
        of the Testator’s death; and that which follows is the substance
        of the said draft rendered from the vernacular into Latin. (“Ego
        Matheus Paulo ... volens ire in Cretam, ne repentinus casus hujus
        vite fragilis me subreperet intestatum, mea propria manu meum
        scripsi et condidi testamentum, rogans Petrum Paganum ecclesie Scti.

        ut, secundum ipsius scripturam quam sibi tunc dedi meo sigillo
        munitam, meum scriberet testamentum, si me de hoc seculo contigeret
        pertransire; cujus scripture tenor translato vulgari in latinum per
        omnia talis est.”)</p>

      <p>3. Appoints as Trustees Messer Maffeo Polo his uncle, Marco Polo his
        brother, Messer Nicolo Secreto (or Sagredo) his father-in-law, and
        Felix Polo his cousin (<i lang="la">consanguineum</i>).</p>

      <p>4. Leaves 20 <i>soldi</i> to each of the Monasteries from Grado to Capo
        d’Argine; and 150 <i>lire</i> to all the congregations of Rialto, on
        condition that the priests of these maintain an annual service in
        behalf of the souls of his father, mother, and self.</p>

      <p>5. To his daughter Fiordelisa 2000 <i>lire</i> to marry her withal. To be
        invested in safe mortgages in Venice, and the interest to go to her.</p>

      <p>Also leaves her the interest from 1000 <i>lire</i> of his funds in Public Debt
        (? <i lang="la">de meis imprestitis</i>) to provide for her till she marries. After
        her marriage this 1000 <i>lire</i> and its interest shall go to his male
        heir if he has one, and failing that to his brother Marco.</p>

      <p>6. To his wife Catharine 400 <i>lire</i> and all her clothes as they stand
        now. To the Lady Maroca 100 <i>lire</i>.</p>

      <p>7. To his natural daughter Pasqua 400 <i>lire</i> to marry her withal. Or,
        if she likes to be a nun, 200 <i>lire</i> shall go to her convent and the
        other 200 shall purchase securities for her benefit. After her death
        these shall come to his male heir, or failing that be sold, and
        the proceeds distributed for the good of the souls of his father,
        mother, and self.</p>

      <p>8. To his natural brothers Stephen and Giovannino he leaves 500 <i>lire</i>.
        If one dies the whole to go to the other. If both die before
        marrying, to go to his male heir; failing such, to his brother Marco
        or <em>his</em> male heir.</p>

      <p>9. To his uncle Giordano Trevisano 200 <i>lire</i>. To Marco de Tumba 100.
        To Fiordelisa, wife of Felix Polo, 100. To Maroca, the daughter
        of the late Pietro Trevisano, living at Negropont, 100. To Agnes,
        wife of Pietro Lion, 100; and to Francis, son of the late Pietro
        Trevisano, in Negropont, 100.</p>

      <p>10. To buy Public Debt producing an annual 20 <i>lire ai grossi</i> to be
        paid yearly to Pietro Pagano, Priest of S. Felice, who shall pray
        for the souls aforesaid: on death of said Pietro the income to go
        to Pietro’s cousin Lionardo, Clerk of S. Felice; and after him
        always to the senior priest of S. Giovanni Grisostomo with the same
        obligation.</p>

      <p>11. Should his wife prove with child and bear a son or sons they shall
        have his whole property not disposed of. If a daughter, she shall
        have the same as Fiordelisa.</p>

      <p>12. If he have no male heir his Brother Marco shall have the Testator’s
        share of his Father’s bequest, and 2000 <i>lire</i> besides. Cousin
        Nicolo shall have 500 <i>lire</i>, and Uncle Maffeo 500.</p>

      <p>13. Should Daughter Fiordelisa die unmarried her 2000 <i>lire</i> and
        interest to go to his male heir, and failing such to Brother Marco
        and his male heir. But in that case Marco shall pay 500 <i>lire</i> to
        Cousin Nicolo or his male heir.</p>

      <p>14. Should his wife bear him a male heir or heirs, but these should die
        under age, the whole of his undisposed property shall go to Brother
        Marco or his male heir. But in that case 500 <i>lire</i> shall be paid to
        Cousin Nicolo.</p>

      <p>15. Should his wife bear a daughter and she die unmarried, her 2000
        <i>lire</i> and interest shall go to Brother Marco, with the same
        stipulation in behalf of Cousin Nicolo.</p>

      <p>16. Should the whole amount of his property between cash and goods not
        amount to 10,000 <i>lire</i> (though he believes he has fully as much),
        his bequests are to be ratably diminished, except those to his own
        children which he does not wish diminished. Should any legatee
        die before receiving the bequest, its amount shall fall to the
        Testator’s heir male, and failing such, the half to go to Marco or
        his male heir, and the other half to be distributed for the good of
        the souls aforesaid.</p>

      <p>The witnesses are Lionardo priest of S. Felice, Lionardo clerk of the
        same, and the Notary Pietro Pagano priest of the same.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_244" href="#FNanchor_244" class="label">[13]</a> Marsden says of Moreta and Fantina, the only daughters
      named by Ramusio, that these may be thought rather familiar terms
      of endearment than baptismal names. This is a mistake however.
      <em>Fantina</em> is from one of the parochial saints of Venice, S. Fantino,
      and the male name was borne by sundry Venetians, among others by a
      son of Henry Dandolo’s. Moreta is perhaps a variation of Maroca,
      which seems to have been a family name among the Polos. We find also
      the male name of Bellela, written <em>Bellello</em>, <em>Bellero</em>, <em>Belletto</em>.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_245" href="#FNanchor_245" class="label">[14]</a> The <em>Decima</em> went to the Bishop of Castello (eventually
      converted into Patriarch of Venice) to divide between himself, the
      Clergy, the Church, and the Poor. It became a source of much bad
      feeling, which came to a head after the plague of 1348, when some
      families had to pay the tenth three times within a very short space.
      The existing Bishop agreed to a composition, but his successor Paolo
      Foscari (1367) claimed that on the death of every citizen an exact
      inventory should be made, and a full tithe levied. The Signory
      fought hard with the Bishop, but he fled to the Papal Court and
      refused all concession. After his death in 1376 a composition was
      made for 5500 ducats yearly. (<cite>Romanin</cite>, II. 406; III. 161, 165.)</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_246" href="#FNanchor_246" class="label">[15]</a> There is a difficulty about estimating the value of
      these sums from the variety of Venice pounds or <i>lire</i>. Thus the
      <em>Lira dei piccoli</em> was reckoned 3 to the ducat or zecchin, the
      <em>Lira ai grossi</em> 2 to the ducat, but the <em>Lira</em> dei <em>grossi</em> or
      <em>Lira d’imprestidi</em> was equal to 10 ducats, or (allowing for
      higher value of silver then) about 3<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i>; a little more
      than the equivalent of the then Pound sterling. This last money
      is <em>specified</em> in some of the bequests, as in the 20 soldi (or 1
      lira) to St. Lorenzo, and in the annuity of 8 lire to Polo’s wife;
      but it seems doubtful what money is meant when <em>libra</em> only or
      <em>libra denariorum venetorum</em> is used. And this doubt is not new.
      Gallicciolli relates that in 1232 Giacomo Menotto left to the Church
      of S. Cassiano as an annuity <em>libras denariorum venetorum quatuor</em>.
      Till 1427 the church received the income as of <em>lire dei piccoli</em>,
      but on bringing a suit on the subject it was adjudged that <em>lire ai
      grossi</em> were to be understood. (<cite>Delle Mem. Venet. Ant.</cite> II. 18.)
      This story, however, cuts both ways, and does not decide our doubt.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_247" href="#FNanchor_247" class="label">[16]</a> The form of the name <em>Ysabeta</em> aptly illustrates the

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_249" href="#FNanchor_249" class="label">[18]</a> The word rendered <em>Guilds</em> is “<em>Scholarum</em>.” The crafts at
      Venice were united in corporations called <em>Fraglie</em> or <em>Scholae</em>,
      each of which had its statutes, its head called the <em>Gastald</em>, and
      its place of meeting under the patronage of some saint. These acted
      as societies of mutual aid, gave dowries to poor girls, caused
      masses to be celebrated for deceased members, joined in public
      religious processions, etc., nor could any craft be exercised except
      by members of such a guild. (<cite>Romanin</cite>, I. 390.)</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_250" href="#FNanchor_250" class="label">[19]</a> A few years after Ser Marco’s death (1328) we find the
      Great Council granting to this Peter the rights of a natural
      Venetian, as having been a long time at Venice, and well-conducted.
      (See App. C, <cite>Calendar of Documents</cite>, No. 13.) This might give some
      additional colour to M. Pauthier’s supposition that this Peter the
      Tartar was a faithful servant who had accompanied Messer Marco
      from the East 30 years before. But yet the supposition is probably
      unfounded. Slavery and slave-trade were very prevalent at Venice in
      the Middle Ages, and V. Lazari, a writer who examined a great many
      records connected therewith, found that by far the greater number
      of slaves were described as <em>Tartars</em>. There does not seem to be
      any clear information as to how they were imported, but probably
      from the factories on the Black Sea, especially Tana after its
      establishment.

      <p>A tax of 5 ducats per head was set on the export of slaves in 1379,
        and as the revenue so received under the Doge Tommaso Mocenigo
        (1414–1423) amounted (so says Lazari) to 50,000 ducats, the
        startling conclusion is that 10,000 slaves yearly were exported!
        This it is difficult to accept. The slaves were chiefly employed
        in domestic service, and the records indicate the women to have
        been about twice as numerous as the men. The highest price recorded
        is 87 ducats paid for a Russian girl sold in 1429. All the higher
        prices are for young women; a significant circumstance. With the
        existence of this system we may safely connect the extraordinary
        frequence of mention of illegitimate children in Venetian wills and
        genealogies. (See <cite>Lazari, Del Traffico degli Schiavi in Venezia</cite>,
        etc., in <cite>Miscellanea di Storia Italiana</cite>, I. 463 <i>seqq.</i>) In 1308 the
        Khan Toktai of Kipchak (see Polo, II. 496), hearing that the Genoese
        and other Franks were in the habit of carrying off Tartar children
        to sell, sent a force against Caffa, which was occupied without
        resistance, the people taking refuge in their ships. The Khan also
        seized the Genoese property in Sarai. (<cite>Heyd.</cite> II. 27.)</p>

      <a id="Footnote_251" href="#FNanchor_251" class="label">[20]</a> “<i lang="la">Stracium et omne capud massariciorum</i>”; in Scotch phrase
      “<em>napery and plenishing</em>.” A Venetian statute of 1242 prescribes
      that a bequest of <i lang="la">massariticum</i> shall be held to carry to the
      legatee all articles of common family use except those of gold

      <a id="Footnote_252" href="#FNanchor_252" class="label">[21]</a> In the original <i lang="la">aureas libras quinque</i>. According to
      Marino Sanudo the Younger (<em>Vite dei Dogi</em> in <cite>Muratori</cite>, xxii.
      521) this should be pounds or <i>lire</i> of <em>aureole</em>, the name of a
      silver coin struck by and named after the Doge <em>Aurio</em> Mastropietro
      (1178–1192): “Ancora fu fatta una Moneta d’argento che si chiamava
      <em>Aureola</em> per la casata del Doge; <em>è quella Moneta che i Notai de
      Venezia mettevano di pena sotto i loro instrumenti</em>.” But this was
      a vulgar error. An example of the penalty of 5 pounds of gold is
      quoted from a decree of 960; and the penalty is sometimes expressed
      “<i lang="la">auri purissimi librae</i> 5.” A coin called the <em>lira d’oro</em> or
      <em>redonda</em> is alleged to have been in use before the ducat was
      introduced. (See <cite>Gallicciolli</cite>, II. 16.) But another authority
      seems to identify the <em>lira a oro</em> with the <em>lira dei grossi</em>. (See
      <cite>Zanetti, Nuova Racc. delle Monete &amp;c. d’Italia</cite>, 1775. I. 308.)</div>

      <a id="Footnote_253" href="#FNanchor_253" class="label">[22]</a> We give a photographic reduction of the original document.
      This, and the other two Polo Wills already quoted, had come into the
      possession of the Noble Filippo Balbi, and were by him presented in
      our own time to the St. Mark’s Library. They are all on parchment,
      in writing of that age, and have been officially examined and
      declared to be originals. They were first published by <cite>Cicogna,
      Iscrizioni Veneziane</cite>, III. 489–493. We give Marco’s in the original
      language, line for line with the facsimile, in <i>Appendix C</i>.

      <p>There is no signature, as may be seen, except those of the Witnesses
        and the Notary. The sole presence of a Notary was held to make a
        deed valid, and from about the middle of the 13th century in Italy
        it is common to find no actual signature (even of witnesses) except
        that of the Notary. The peculiar flourish before the Notary’s
        name is what is called the <em>Tabellionato</em>, a fanciful distinctive
        monogram which each Notary adopted. Marco’s Will is unfortunately
        written in a very cramp hand with many contractions. The other two

      <a id="Footnote_254" href="#FNanchor_254" class="label">[23]</a> We have noticed formerly
      (<a href="#Footnote_124">pp. <i>14–15</i></a>, note) the recent
      discovery of a document bearing what was supposed to be the
      autograph signature of our Traveller. The document in question is
      the Minute of a Resolution of the Great Council, attested by the
      signatures of three members, of whom the last is <span class="smcap">Marcus Paullo</span>. But
      the date alone, 11th March, 1324, is sufficient to raise the gravest
      doubts as to this signature being that of our Marco. And further
      examination, as I learn from a friend at Venice, has shown that the
      same name occurs in connection with analogous entries on several
      subsequent occasions up to the middle of the century. I presume that
      this Marco Polo is the same that is noticed in our <i>Appendix B</i>, II.
      as a voter in the elections of the Doges Marino Faliero and Giovanni
      Gradenigo. I have not been able to ascertain his relation to either
      branch of the Polo family; but I suspect that he belonged to that of
      S. Geremia, of which there <em>was</em> certainly a Marco about the middle
      of the century.</div>

      to discover new countries. No faith was put in him because of the
      extravagant things that he recounted; but in the days of our Fathers
      Columbus augmented belief in him, by discovering that part of the

      heard from Mr. Wylie, a very competent authority, this is nonsense.
      The temple contains 500 figures of <em>Arhans</em> or Buddhist saints, and
      one of these attracts attention from having a hat like a sailor’s
      straw hat. Mr. Wylie had not remarked the name. [A model of this

      <p>In the Venetian archives occurs a procuration executed by the Doge
        in favour of the <em>Nobilis Vir</em> <span class="smcap">Ser Marco Paulo</span> that he may present
        himself before the king of Sicily; under date, Venice 9th November,
        1342. And some years later we have in the Sicilian Archives an
        order by King Lewis of Sicily, directed to the Maestri Procuratori
        of Messina, which grants to <span class="smcap">Marco Polo</span> of Venice, on account of
        services rendered to the king’s court, the privilege of free import
        and export at the port of Messina, without payment of customs of
        goods to the amount annually of 20 ounces. Dated in Catania 13th
        January, 1346 (1347?).</p>

      <p>For the former notice I am indebted to the courtesy of Signor B.
        Cecchetti of the Venetian Archives, who cites it as “transcribed
        in the <cite>Commemor.</cite> IV. p. 5”; for the latter to that of the Abate
        Carini of the <em>Reale Archivio</em> at Palermo; it is in <cite>Archivio della
        Regia Cancellaria</cite> 1343–1357, f. 58.</p>

      <p>The mission of this <span class="smcap">Marco Polo</span> is mentioned also in a rescript of
        the Sicilian king Peter II., dated Messina, 14th November, 1340, in
        reference to certain claims of Venice, about which the said Marco
        appeared as the Doge’s ambassador. This is printed in F. <span class="smcap">Testa</span>, <cite>De

      <p>It is possible that this Marco, who from the latter notice seems to
        have been engaged in mercantile affairs, may have been the Marcolino
        above mentioned, but it is perhaps on the whole more probable that

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_IXi">IX. <span class="smcap">Marco Polo’s Book; and the Language in which it was first written.</span></h4>

  <p>50. The Book itself consists essentially of Two Parts. <em>First</em>, of
    a Prologue, as it is termed, the only part which is actual personal
    <span class="sidenote">General statement of what the Book contains.</span>
    narrative, and which relates, in a very interesting but far too brief
    manner, the circumstances which led the two elder Polos to the Kaan’s
    Court, and those of their second journey with Mark, and of their return to
    Persia through the Indian Seas. <em>Secondly</em>, of a long series of chapters
    of very unequal length, descriptive of notable sights and products, of
    curious manners and remarkable events, relating to the different nations
    and states of Asia, but, above all, to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i81"><i>81</i></span>Emperor Kúblái, his court,
    wars, and administration. A series of chapters near the close treats in a
    verbose and monotonous manner of sundry wars that took place between the
    various branches of the House of Chinghiz in the latter half of the 13th
    century. This last series is either omitted or greatly curtailed in all
    the copies and versions except one; a circumstance perfectly accounted for
    by the absence of interest as well as value in the bulk of these chapters.
    Indeed, desirous though I have been to give the Traveller’s work complete,
    and sharing the dislike that every man who <em>uses</em> books must bear to
    abridgments, I have felt that it would be sheer waste and dead-weight to
    print these chapters in full.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp83" id="f080">
    <img class="w100" src="images/f080.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Porcelain Incense-Burner, from the Louvre.</div>
  </div>

  <p>This second and main portion of the Work is in its oldest forms undivided,
    the chapters running on consecutively to the end.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In some very early
    Italian or Venetian version, which Friar Pipino translated into Latin, it
    was divided into three Books, and this convenient division has generally
    been adhered to. We have adopted M. Pauthier’s suggestion in making the
    final series of chapters, chiefly historical, into a Fourth.</p>

  <p>51. As regards the language in which Marco’s Book was first committed to
    writing, we have seen that Ramusio assumed, somewhat arbitrarily, that
    it was <em>Latin</em>; <span class="sidenote">Language of the original Work.</span>Marsden supposed it to have been the <em>Venetian</em> dialect;
    Baldelli Boni first showed, in his elaborate edition (Florence, 1827), by
    arguments that have been illustrated and corroborated by learned men since,
    that it was <em>French</em>.</p>

  <p>That the work was originally written in <em>some</em> Italian dialect was a
    natural presumption, and slight contemporary evidence can be alleged in its
    favour; for Fra Pipino, in the Latin version of the work, executed whilst
    Marco still lived, describes his task as a translation <i lang="la">de vulgari</i>. And in
    one MS. copy of the same Friar Pipino’s Chronicle, existing in the library
    at Modena, he refers to the said version as made “<i lang="la">ex vulgari idiomate</i>
    Lombardico.” But though it may seem improbable that at so early a date
    a Latin version should have been made at second hand, I believe this to
    have been the case, and that some internal evidence also is traceable that
    Pipino translated <em>not</em> from the original but from an Italian <em>version</em> of
    the original.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i82"><i>82</i></span></p>

  <p>The oldest MS. (it is supposed) in any Italian dialect is one in the
    Magliabecchian Library at Florence, which is known in Italy as <em>L’Ottima</em>,
    on account of the purity of its Tuscan, and as <em>Della Crusca</em> from its
    being one of the authorities cited by that body in their Vocabulary.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It
    bears on its face the following note in Italian:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“This Book called the Navigation of Messer Marco Polo, a noble
      Citizen of Venice, was written in Florence by Michael Ormanni my
      great grandfather by the Mother’s side, who died in the Year of Grace
      One Thousand Three Hundred and Nine; and my mother brought it into
      our Family of Del Riccio, and it belongs to me Pier del Riccio and to
      my Brother; 1452.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>As far as I can learn, the age which this note implies is considered to be
    supported by the character of the MS. itself.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> If it be accepted, the
    latter is a performance going back to within eleven years <em>at most</em> of
    the first dictation of the Travels. At first sight, therefore, this would
    rather argue that the original had been written in pure Tuscan. But when
    Baldelli came to prepare it for the press he found manifest indications
    of its being a Translation from the <em>French</em>. Some of these he has noted;
    others have followed up the same line of comparison. We give some detailed
    examples in a note.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i83"><i>83</i></span></p>

  <p>52. The French Text that we have been quoting, published by the
    Geographical Society of Paris in 1824, affords on the other hand the
    strongest corresponding<span class="sidenote">Old French Text published by the Société de Géographie.</span> proof that it is an original and not a Translation.
    Rude as is the language of the manuscript (Fr. 1116, formerly No. 7367,
    of Paris Library), it is, in the correctness of the proper names, and the
    intelligible exhibition of the itineraries, much superior to any form of
    the Work previously published.</p>

  <p>The language is very peculiar. We are obliged to call it French, but it is
    not “Frenche of Paris.” “Its style,” says Paulin Paris, “is about as like
    that of good French authors of the age, as in our day the natural accent
    of a German, an Englishman, or an Italian, is like that of a citizen of
    Paris or Blois.” The author is at war with all the practices of French
    grammar; subject and object, numbers, moods, and tenses, are in consummate
    confusion. Even readers of his own day must at times have been fain to
    guess his meaning. Italian words are constantly introduced, either quite in
    the crude or rudely Gallicized.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> And words <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i84"><i>84</i></span>also, we may add, sometimes
    slip in which appear to be purely Oriental, just as is apt to happen with
    Anglo-Indians in these days.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> All this is perfectly consistent with the
    supposition that we have in this MS. a copy at least of the original words
    as written down by Rusticiano a Tuscan, from the dictation of Marco an
    Orientalized Venetian, in French, a language foreign to both.</p>

  <p>But the character of the language <em>as French</em> is not its only peculiarity.
    There is in the style, apart from grammar or vocabulary, a rude angularity,
    a rough dramatism like that of oral narrative; there is a want of
    proportion in the style of different parts, now over curt, now diffuse and
    wordy, with at times even a hammering reiteration; a constant recurrence
    of pet colloquial phrases (in which, however, other literary works of the
    age partake); a frequent change in the spelling of the same proper names,
    even when recurring within a few lines, as if caught by ear only; a literal
    following to and fro of the hesitations of the narrator; a more general
    use of the third person in speaking of the Traveller, but an occasional
    lapse into the first. All these characteristics are strikingly indicative
    of the unrevised product of dictation, and many of them would <em>necessarily</em>
    disappear either in translation or in a revised copy.</p>

  <p>Of changes in representing the same proper name, take as an example that of
    the Kaan of Persia whom Polo calls <em>Quiacatu</em> (Kaikhátú), but also <em>Acatu,
    Catu</em>, and the like.</p>

  <p>As an example of the literal following of dictation take the following:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Let us leave Rosia, and I will tell you about the Great Sea (the
      Euxine), and what provinces and nations lie round about it, all
      in detail; and we will begin with Constantinople—First, however,
      I should tell you about a province, etc.... There is nothing more
      worth mentioning, so I will speak of other subjects,—but there is one
      thing more to tell you about Rosia that I had forgotten.... Now then
      let us speak of the Great Sea as I was about to do. To be sure many
      merchants and others have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i85"><i>85</i></span>been here, but still there are many again
      who know nothing about it, so it will be well to include it in our
      Book. We will do so then, and let us begin first with the Strait of
      Constantinople.</p>

    <p>“At the Straits leading into the Great Sea, on the West Side, there
      is a hill called the Faro.—But since beginning on this matter I have
      changed my mind, because so many people know all about it, so we will
      not put it in our description but go on to something else.” (See vol.
      ii. p. 487 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>And so on.</p>

  <p>As a specimen of tautology and hammering reiteration the following can
    scarcely be surpassed. The Traveller is speaking of the <em>Chughi</em>, <i>i.e.</i> the
    Indian Jogis:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“And there are among them certain devotees, called <em>Chughi</em>; these
      are longer-lived than the other people, for they live from 150 to 200
      years; and yet they are so hale of body that they can go and come
      wheresoever they please, and do all the service needed for their
      monastery or their idols, and do it just as well as if they were
      younger; and that comes of the great abstinence that they practise,
      in eating little food and only what is wholesome; for they use to
      eat rice and milk more than anything else. And again I tell you
      that these Chughi who live such a long time as I have told you, do
      also eat what I am going to tell you, and you will think it a great
      matter. For I tell you that they take quicksilver and sulphur, and
      mix them together, and make a drink of them, and then they drink
      this, and they say that it adds to their life; and in fact they do
      live much longer for it; and I tell you that they do this twice
      every month. And let me tell you that these people use this drink
      from their infancy in order to live longer, and without fail those
      who live so long as I have told you use this drink of sulphur and
      quicksilver.” (See G.&nbsp;T. p. 213.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Such talk as this does not survive the solvent of translation; and we
    may be certain that we have here the nearest approach to the Traveller’s
    reminiscences as they were taken down from his lips in the prison of Genoa.</p>

  <div class="sidenote">Conclusive proof that the Old French Text is the source of all
    the others.</div>

  <p>53. Another circumstance, heretofore I believe unnoticed, is in itself
    enough to demonstrate the Geographic Text to be the source of all other
    versions of the Work. It is this.</p>

  <p>In reviewing the various classes or types of texts of Polo’s Book, which
    we shall hereafter attempt to discriminate, there are certain proper names
    which we find in the different texts to take very different forms, each
    class adhering in the main to one particular form.</p>

  <p>Thus the names of the Mongol ladies introduced at pp. <a href="#Page_32">32</a> and <a href="#Page_36"></a>36 of this
    volume, which are in proper Oriental form <em>Bulughán</em> and <em>Kukáchin</em>,
    appear in the class of MSS. which Pauthier has followed as <em>Bolgara</em> and
    <em>Cogatra</em>; in the MSS. of Pipino’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i86"><i>86</i></span>version, and those founded on it,
    including Ramusio, the names appear in the correcter forms <em>Bolgana</em> or
    <em>Balgana</em> and <em>Cogacin</em>. Now <em>all the forms</em> Bolgana, Balgana, Bolgara,
    <em>and</em> Cogatra, Cocacin <em>appear in the Geographic Text</em>.</p>

  <p>Kaikhátú Kaan appears in the Pauthier MSS. as <em>Chiato</em>, in the Pipinian as
    <em>Acatu</em>, in the Ramusian as <em>Chiacato. All three forms</em>, Chiato, Achatu,
    and Quiacatu <em>are found in the Geographic Text</em>.</p>

  <p>The city of Koh-banan appears in the Pauthier MSS. as <em>Cabanant</em>, in the
    Pipinian and Ramusian editions as <em>Cobinam</em> or <em>Cobinan</em>. <em>Both forms are
    found in the Geographic Text</em>.</p>

  <p>The city of the Great Kaan (Khanbalig) is called in the Pauthier MSS.
    <em>Cambaluc</em>, in the Pipinian and Ramusian less correctly <em>Cambalu</em>. <em>Both
    forms appear in the Geographic Text</em>.</p>

  <p>The aboriginal People on the Burmese Frontier who received from the Western
    officers of the Mongols the Persian name (translated from that applied by
    the Chinese) of <em>Zardandán</em>, or Gold-Teeth, appear in the Pauthier MSS.
    most accurately as Zardandan, but in the Pipinian as <em>Ardandan</em> (still
    further corrupted in some copies into <em>Arcladam</em>). Now <em>both forms are
    found in the Geographic Text</em>. Other examples might be given, but these I
    think may suffice to prove that this Text was the common source of both classes.</p>

  <p>In considering the question of the French original too we must remember
    what has been already said regarding Rusticien de Pise and his other French
    writings; and we shall find hereafter an express testimony borne in the
    next generation that Marco’s Book was composed <em>in vulgari Gallico</em>.</p>

  <p>54. But, after all, the circumstantial evidence that has been adduced from
    the texts themselves is the most conclusive. <span class="sidenote">Greatly diffused employment of French in that age.</span>We have then every reason to
    believe both that the work was written in French, and that an existing
    French Text is a close representation of it as originally committed to
    paper. And that being so we may cite some circumstances to show that the
    use of French or quasi-French for the purpose was not a fact of a very
    unusual or surprising nature. The French language had at that time almost
    as wide, perhaps relatively a wider, diffusion than it has now. It was
    still spoken at the Court of England, and still used by many English
    writers, of whom the authors or translators of the Round Table <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i87"><i>87</i></span>Romances
    at Henry III.’s Court are examples.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> In 1249 Alexander III. King of
    Scotland, at his coronation spoke in Latin and French; and in 1291 the
    English Chancellor addressing the Scotch Parliament did so in French. At
    certain of the Oxford Colleges as late as 1328 it was an order that the

  <p class="noindent">Indeed down to nearly 1385, boys in the English grammar-schools were
    taught to construe their Latin lessons into French.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> St. Francis of
    Assisi is said by some of his biographers to have had his original name
    changed to Francesco because of his early mastery of that language as
    a qualification for commerce. French had been the prevalent tongue of
    the Crusaders, and was that of the numerous Frank Courts which they
    established in the East, including Jerusalem and the states of the Syrian
    coast, Cyprus, Constantinople during the reign of the Courtenays, and the
    principalities of the Morea. The Catalan soldier and chronicler Ramon de
    Muntaner tells us that it was commonly said of the Morean chivalry that
    they spoke as good French as at Paris.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Quasi-French at least was
    still spoken half a century later by the numerous Christians settled at
    Aleppo, as John Marignolli testifies;<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and if we may trust Sir John
    Maundevile the Soldan of Egypt himself and four of his chief Lords “<em>spak
    Frensche righte wel!</em>”<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Gházán Kaan, the accomplished Mongol Sovereign
    of Persia, to whom our Traveller conveyed a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i88"><i>88</i></span>bride from Cambaluc, is said
    by the historian Rashiduddin to have known something of the Frank tongue,
    probably French.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Nay, if we may trust the author of the Romance of
    Richard Cœur-de-Lion, French was in his day the language of still higher
    spheres!<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

  <p>Nor was Polo’s case an exceptional one even among writers on the East who
    were not Frenchmen. Maundevile himself tells us that he put his book first
    “out of Latyn into Frensche,” and then out of French into English.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The
    History of the East which the Armenian Prince and Monk Hayton dictated to
    Nicolas Faulcon at Poictiers in 1307 was taken down in French. There are
    many other instances of the employment of French by foreign, and especially
    by Italian authors of that age. The Latin chronicle of the Benedictine
    Amato of Monte Cassino was translated into French early in the 13th century
    by another monk of the same abbey, at the particular desire of the Count
    of Militrée (or Malta), “<i lang="fr">Pour ce qu’il set lire et entendre fransoize et
    s’en delitte.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Martino da Canale, a countryman and contemporary of
    Polo’s, during the absence of the latter in the East wrote a Chronicle of
    Venice in the same language, as a reason for which he alleges its general
    popularity.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The like does the most notable example of all, Brunetto
    Latini, Dante’s master, who wrote in French his encyclopædic and once
    highly popular work <cite>Li Tresor</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Other examples might be given, but
    in fact <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i89"><i>89</i></span>such illustration is superfluous when we consider that Rusticiano
    himself was a compiler of French Romances.</p>

  <p>But why the language of the Book as we see it in the Geographic Text
    should be so much more rude, inaccurate, and Italianized than that of
    Rusticiano’s other writings, is a question to which I can suggest no reply
    quite satisfactory to myself. Is it possible that we have in it a literal
    representation of Polo’s own language in dictating the story,—a rough draft
    which it was intended afterwards to reduce to better form, and which was so
    reduced (after a fashion) in French copies of another type, regarding which
    we shall have to speak presently?<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> And, if this be the true answer, why
    should Polo have used a French jargon in which to tell his story? Is it
    possible that his own mother Venetian, such as he had carried to the East
    with him and brought back again, was so little intelligible to Rusticiano
    that French of some kind was the handiest medium of communication between
    the two? I have known an Englishman and a Hollander driven to converse in
    Malay; Chinese Christians of different provinces are said sometimes to take
    to English as the readiest means of intercommunication; and the same is
    said even of Irish-speaking Irishmen from remote parts of the Island.</p>

  <p>It is worthy of remark how many notable narratives of the Middle Ages
    have been dictated instead of being written by their authors, and that
    in cases where it is impossible to ascribe this to ignorance of writing.
    The Armenian Hayton, though evidently a well-read man, possibly could not
    write in Roman characters. But Joinville is an illustrious example. And the
    narratives of four of the most famous Mediæval Travellers<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> seem to have
    been drawn from them by a kind of pressure, and committed to paper by other
    hands. I have elsewhere remarked this as indicating how little diffused
    was literary ambition or vanity; but it would perhaps be more correct to
    ascribe it to that intense dislike which is still seen on the shores of
    the Mediterranean <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i90"><i>90</i></span>to the use of pen and ink. On certain of those shores at
    least there is scarcely any inconvenience that the majority of respectable
    and good-natured people will not tolerate—inconvenience to their neighbours
    be it understood—rather than put pen to paper for the purpose of preventing it.</p>

      with Del Riccio’s note were given in facsimile in the First Edition.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_273" href="#FNanchor_273" class="label">[4]</a> The Crusca is cited from Bartoli’s edition.

      <p>French idioms are frequent, as <em>l’uomo</em> for the French <em>on</em>;
        <em>quattro-vinti</em> instead of <em>ottanta</em>; etc.</p>

      <p>We have at p. 35, “<em>Questo piano è molto</em> cavo,” which is nonsense,
        but is explained by reference to the French (G.&nbsp;T.) “<em>Voz di qu’il
        est celle plaingne mout</em> chaue” (<em>chaude</em>).</p>

      <p>The bread in Kerman is bitter, says the G.&nbsp;T. “<em>por ce que l’eive hi
        est</em> amer,” because the water there is bitter. The Crusca mistakes
        the last word and renders (p. 40) “<em>e questi è per lo</em> mare <em>che vi viene</em>.”</p>

      <p>“<em>Sachiés de voir qe</em> endementiers,” know for a truth that whilst——,
        by some misunderstanding of the last word becomes (p. 129)
        “<em>Sappiate di vero</em> sanza mentire.”</p>

      <p>“<em>Mès de sel</em> font-il monoie”—“They make money of salt,” becomes (p.
        168) “<em>ma fannole</em> da loro,” <em>sel</em> being taken for a pronoun, whilst
        in another place <em>sel</em> is transferred bodily without translation.</p>

      <p>“<em>Chevoil</em>,” “hair” of the old French, appears in the Tuscan (p.
        20) as <em>cavagli</em>, “horses.”—“<em>La Grant Provence</em> Jereraus,” the
        great general province, appears (p. 68) as a province whose proper
        name is <em>Ienaraus</em>. In describing Kúblái’s expedition against Mien
        or Burma, Polo has a story of his calling on the Jugglers at his
        court to undertake the job, promising them a Captain and other help,
        “<em>Cheveitain et aide</em>.” This has fairly puzzled the Tuscan, who
        converts these (p. 186) into two Tartar tribes, “<em>quegli d’</em>Aide <em>e
        quegli di</em> Caveità.”</p>

      <p>So also we have <em>lievre</em> for hare transferred without change;
        <em>lait</em>, milk, appearing as <em>laido</em> instead of <em>latte</em>; <em>très</em>,
        rendered as “three”; <em>bue</em>, “mud,” Italianised as <em>buoi</em>, “oxen,”
        and so forth. Finally, in various places when Polo is explaining
        Oriental terms we find in the Tuscan MS. “<em>cioè a dire in</em>
        Francesco.”</p>

      <p>The blunders mentioned are intelligible enough as in a version <em>from
        the French</em>; but in the description of the Indian pearl-fishery
        we have a startling one not so easy to account for. The French
        says, “the divers gather the sea-oysters (<em>hostrige de Mer</em>), and
        in these the pearls are found.” This appears in the Tuscan in
        the extraordinary form that the divers catch those fishes called
        <em>Herrings</em> (Aringhe), and in those Herrings are found the Pearls!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_274" href="#FNanchor_274" class="label">[5]</a> As examples of these Italianisms: “<em>Et ont del</em> olio <em>de
      la lanpe dou</em> sepolchro <em>de Crist</em>”; “<em>L’Angel ven en vision pour
      mesajes de Deu à un</em> Veschevo <em>qe mout estoient home de</em> sante
      vite”; “<em>E certes il estoit bien</em> beizongno”; “<em>ne trop caut ne
      trop</em> fredo”; “<em>la</em> crense” (<em>credenza</em>); “remort” for noise
      (<em>rumore</em>); “inverno”; “jorno”; “dementiqué” (<em>dimenticato</em>);
      “enferme” for sickly; “leign” (<em>legno</em>); “devisce” (<em>dovizia</em>);
      “ammalaide” (<em>ammalato</em>), etc. etc.

      <p>Professor Bianconi points out that there are also traces of
        <em>Venetian</em> dialect, as <em>Pare</em> for <em>père</em>; <em>Mojer</em> for wife;
        <em>Zabater</em>, cobbler; <em>cazaor</em>, huntsman, etc.</p>

      <p>I have not been able to learn to what extent books in this kind
        of mixed language are extant. I have observed one, a romance in
        verse called <em>Macaire</em> (<i lang="de">Altfranzösische Gedichte aus Venez.
        Handschriften</i>, von <cite>Adolf Mussafia</cite>, Wien, 1864), the language of
        which is not unlike this jargon of Rustician’s, <i>e.g.</i>:—</p>

      <a id="Footnote_275" href="#FNanchor_275" class="label">[6]</a> As examples of such Orientalisms: <em>Bonus</em>, “ebony,” and

      <em>Harems</em>; in speaking of the land of the Ismaelites or Assassins,
      called <em>Mulhete</em>, <i>i.e.</i> the Arabic <em>Muláhidah</em>, “Heretics,”
      he explains this term as meaning “des <em>Aram</em>” (<em>Ḥarám</em>, “the
      reprobate”). Speaking of the Viceroys of Chinese Provinces, we are
      told that they rendered their accounts yearly to the <em>Safators</em> of
      the Great Kaan. This is certainly an Oriental word. Sir H. Rawlinson
      has suggested that it stands for <em>dafátir</em> (“registers or public
      books”), pl. of <em>daftar</em>. This seems probable, and in that case the
      true reading may have been <em>dafators</em>.</div>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_Xi">X. <span class="smcap">Various Types of Text of Marco Polo’s Book.</span></h4>

  <p>55. In treating of the various Texts of Polo’s Book we must <span class="sidenote">Four Principal Types of Text. First, that of the Geographic, or
    oldest French.</span>necessarily go
    into some irksome detail.</p>

  <p>Those Texts that have come down to us may be classified under Four
    principal Types.</p>

  <p>I. The First Type is that of the Geographic Text of which we have already
    said so much. This is found nowhere <em>complete</em> except in the unique MS. of
    the Paris Library, to which it is stated to have come from the old Library
    of the French Kings at Blois. But the Italian <em>Crusca</em>, and the old Latin
    version (No. 3195 of the Paris Library) published with the Geographic
    Text, are evidently derived entirely from it, though both are considerably
    abridged. It is also demonstrable that neither of these copies has been
    translated from the other, for each has passages which the other omits,
    but that both have been taken, the one as a copy more or less loose, the
    other as a translation, from an intermediate <em>Italian</em> copy.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A special
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i91"><i>91</i></span>difference lies in the fact that the Latin version is divided into three
    Books, whilst the Crusca has no such division. I shall show in a tabular
    form the <em>filiation</em> of the texts which these facts seem to demonstrate
    (see Appendix G).</p>

  <p>There are other Italian MSS. of this type, some of which show signs of
    having been derived independently from the French;<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but I have not
    been able to examine any of them with the care needful to make specific
    deductions regarding them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i92"><i>92</i></span></p>

  <p>56. II. The next Type is that of the French MSS. on which M. Pauthier’s
    Text is based, and for which he claims the highest authority, <span class="sidenote">Second;
    the remodelled French Text, followed by Pauthier.</span>as having had
    the mature revision and sanction of the Traveller. There are, as far as I
    know, five MSS. which may be classed together under this type, three in the
    Great Paris Library, one at Bern, and one in the Bodleian.</p>

  <p>The high claims made by Pauthier on behalf of this class of MSS. (on the
    first three of which his Text is formed) rest mainly upon the kind of
    certificate which two of them bear regarding the presentation of a copy
    by Marco Polo to Thibault de Cepoy, which we have already quoted (<i>supra</i>,
    <a href="#Page_i69">p. <i>69</i></a>). This certificate is held by Pauthier to imply that the original
    of the copies which bear it, and of those having a general correspondence
    with them, had the special seal of Marco’s revision and approval. To some
    considerable extent their character is corroborative of such a claim, but
    they are far from having the perfection which Pauthier attributes to them,
    and which leads him into many paradoxes.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to interpret rigidly the bearing of this so-called
    certificate, as if no copies had previously been taken of <em>any</em> form of
    the Book; nor can we allow it to impugn the authenticity of the Geographic
    Text, which demonstratively represents an older original, and has been (as
    we have seen) the parent of all other versions, including some very old
    ones, Italian and Latin, which certainly owe nothing to this revision.</p>

  <p>The first idea apparently entertained by d’Avezac and Paulin Paris was that
    the Geographic Text was <em>itself</em> the copy given to the Sieur de Cepoy, and
    that the differences in the copies of the class which we describe as Type
    II. merely resulted from the modifications which would naturally arise in
    the process of transcription into purer French. But closer examination
    showed the differences to be too great and too marked to admit of this
    explanation. These differences consist not only in the conversion of the
    rude, obscure, and half Italian language of the original into good French
    of the period. There is also very considerable curtailment, generally
    of tautology, but also extending often to circumstances of substantial
    interest; whilst we observe the omission of a few notably erroneous
    statements or expressions; and a few insertions of small importance.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i93"><i>93</i></span>None of the MSS. of this class contain more than a few of the historical
    chapters which we have formed into Book IV.</p>

  <p>The only <em>addition</em> of any magnitude is that chapter which in our
    translation forms chapter xxi. of Book II. It will be seen that it contains
    no new facts, but is only a tedious recapitulation of circumstances already
    stated, though scattered over several chapters. There are a few minor
    additions. I have not thought it worth while to collect them systematically
    here, but two or three examples are given in a note.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>There are also one or two corrections of erroneous statements in the G.&nbsp;T.
    which seem not to be accidental and to indicate some attempt at revision.
    Thus a notable error in the account of Aden, which seems to conceive of the
    Red Sea as a <em>river</em>, disappears in Pauthier’s MSS. A and B.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> And we find
    in these MSS. one or two interesting names preserved which are not found in
    the older Text.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>But on the other hand this class of MSS. contains many erroneous readings
    of names, either adopting the worse of two forms occurring in the G.&nbsp;T. or
    originating blunders of its own.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i94"><i>94</i></span></p>

  <p>M. Pauthier lays great stress on the character of these MSS. as the sole
    authentic form of the work, from their claim to have been specially revised
    by Marco Polo. It is evident, however, from what has been said, that this
    revision can have been only a very careless and superficial one, and must
    have been done in great measure by deputy, being almost entirely confined
    to curtailment and to the improvement of the expression, and that it is by
    no means such as to allow an editor to dispense with a careful study of the
    Older Text.</p>

  <p>57. There is another curious circumstance about the MSS. of this type,
    viz., that they clearly divide into two distinct recensions, <span class="sidenote">The
    Bern MS. and two others form a sub-class of this Type.</span>of which both
    have so many peculiarities and errors in common that they must necessarily
    have been both derived from <em>one</em> modification of the original text, whilst
    at the same time there are such differences between the two as cannot be
    set down to the accidents of transcription. Pauthier’s MSS. A and B (Nos.
    16 and 15 of the List in App. F) form one of these subdivisions: his C (No.
    17 of List), Bern (No. 56), and Oxford (No. 6), the other. Between A and B
    the differences are only such as seem constantly to have arisen from the
    whims of transcribers or their dialectic peculiarities. But between A and B
    on the one side, and C on the other, the differences are much greater. The
    readings of proper names in C are often superior, sometimes worse; but in
    the latter half of the work especially it contains a number of substantial
    passages<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> which are to be found in the G.&nbsp;T., but are altogether absent
    from the MSS. A and B; whilst in one case at least (the history of the
    Siege of Saianfu, vol. ii. p. 159) it diverges considerably from the G.&nbsp;T.
    <em>as well</em> as from A and B.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>I gather from the facts that the MS. C represents an older form of the work
    than A and B. I should judge that the latter had been derived from that
    older form, but intentionally modified from it. And as it is the MS. C,
    with its copy at Bern, that alone presents the certificate of derivation
    from the Book given <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i95"><i>95</i></span>to the Sieur de Cepoy, there can be no doubt that it is
    the true representative of that recension.</p>

  <p>58. III. The next Type of Text is that found in Friar Pipino’s Latin
    version. It is the type of which MSS. are by far the most numerous. <span class="sidenote">Third; Friar Pipino’s Latin.</span>In it
    condensation and curtailment are carried a good deal further than in Type
    II. The work is also divided into three Books. But this division does not
    seem to have originated with Pipino, as we find it in the ruder and perhaps
    older Latin version of which we have already spoken under Type I. And we
    have demonstrated that this ruder Latin is a translation from an Italian
    copy. It is probable therefore that an Italian version similarly divided
    was the common source of what we call the Geographic Latin and of Pipino’s
    more condensed version.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p>Pipino’s version appears to have been executed in the later years of Polo’s
    life.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But I can see no ground for the idea entertained by Baldelli-Boni
    and Professor Bianconi that it was executed with Polo’s cognizance and
    retouched by him.</p>

  <p>59. The absence of effective publication in the Middle Ages led to a
    curious complication<span class="sidenote">The Latin of Grynæus a translation at fifth hand.</span> of translation and retranslation. Thus the Latin
    version published by Grynæus in the <i lang="la">Novus Orbis</i> (Basle, 1532) is
    different from Pipino’s, and yet clearly traceable to it as a base. In fact
    it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i96"><i>96</i></span>is a retranslation into Latin from some version (Marsden thinks the
    printed Portuguese one) of Pipino. It introduces many minor modifications,
    omitting specific statements of numbers and values, generalizing the names
    and descriptions of specific animals, exhibiting frequent sciolism and
    self-sufficiency in modifying statements which the Editor disbelieved.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
    It is therefore utterly worthless as a Text, and it is curious that
    Andreas Müller, who in the 17th century devoted himself to the careful
    editing of Polo, should have made so unfortunate a choice as to reproduce
    this fifth-hand Translation. I may add that the French editions published
    in the middle of the 16th century are <em>translations</em> from Grynæus.
    Hence they complete this curious and vicious circle of translation:
    French—Italian—Pipino’s Latin—Portuguese?—Grynæus’s Latin—French!<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>60. IV. We now come to a Type of Text which deviates largely from any of
    those hitherto spoken of, and the history <span class="sidenote">Fourth; Ramusio’s Italian.</span>and true character of which are
    involved in a cloud of difficulty. We mean that Italian version prepared
    for the press by G. B. Ramusio, with most interesting, though, as we have
    seen, not always accurate preliminary dissertations, and published at
    Venice two years after his death, in the second volume of the <cite>Navigationi
    e Viaggi</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

  <p>The peculiarities of this version are very remarkable. Ramusio seems to
    imply that he used as one basis at least the Latin of Pipino; and many
    circumstances, such as the division into Books, the absence of the terminal
    historical chapters and of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i97"><i>97</i></span>those about the Magi, and the form of many
    proper names, confirm this. But also many additional circumstances and
    anecdotes are introduced, many of the names assume a new shape, and the
    whole style is more copious and literary in character than in any other
    form of the work.</p>

  <p>Whilst some of the changes or interpolations seem to carry us further from
    the truth, others contain facts of Asiatic nature or history, as well as
    of Polo’s own experiences, which it is extremely difficult to ascribe to
    any hand but the Traveller’s own. This was the view taken by Baldelli,
    Klaproth, and Neumann;<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but Hugh Murray, Lazari, and Bartoli regard the
    changes as interpolations by another hand; and Lazari is rash enough to
    ascribe the whole to a <i lang="it">rifacimento</i> of Ramusio’s own age, asserting it
    to contain interpolations not merely from Polo’s own contemporary Hayton,
    but also from travellers of later centuries, such as Conti, Barbosa, and
    Pigafetta. The grounds for these last assertions have not been cited, nor
    can I trace them. But I admit <em>to a certain extent</em> indications of modern
    tampering with the text, especially in cases where proper names seem to
    have been identified and more modern forms substituted. In days, however,
    where an Editor’s duties were ill understood, this was natural.</p>

  <p>61. Thus we find substituted for the <em>Bastra</em> (or <em>Bascra</em>) of the older
    texts the more modern and incorrect <em>Balsora</em>, dear to memories of the
    Arabian Nights;<span class="sidenote">Injudicious tamperings in Ramusio.</span> among the provinces of Persia we have <em>Spaan</em> (Ispahan)
    where older texts read <em>Istanit</em>; for <em>Cormos</em> we have <em>Ormus</em>; for
    <em>Herminia</em> and <em>Laias</em>, <em>Armenia</em> and <em>Giazza</em>; <em>Coulam</em> for the older
    <em>Coilum</em>; <em>Socotera</em> for <em>Scotra</em>. With these changes may be classed the
    chapter-headings, which are undisguisedly modern, and probably Ramusio’s
    own. In some other cases this editorial spirit has been over-meddlesome
    and has gone astray. Thus <em>Malabar</em> is substituted wrongly for <em>Maabar</em>
    in one place, and by a grosser error for <em>Dalivar</em> in another. The age
    of young Marco, at the time of his father’s first return to Venice, has
    been arbitrarily altered from 15 to 19, in order to correspond with a date
    which is itself erroneous. Thus also Polo is made to describe Ormus <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i98"><i>98</i></span>as
    on an Island, contrary to the old texts and to the fact; for the city of
    Hormuz was not transferred to the island, afterwards so famous, till some
    years after Polo’s return from the East. It is probably also the editor who
    in the notice of the oil-springs of Caucasus (<a href="#Page_46">i. p. 46</a>) has substituted
    <em>camel-loads</em> for <em>ship-loads</em>, in ignorance that the site of those alluded
    to was probably Baku on the Caspian.</p>

  <p>Other erroneous statements, such as the introduction of window-glass as one
    of the embellishments of the palace at Cambaluc, are probably due only to
    accidental misunderstanding.</p>

  <p>62. Of circumstances certainly genuine, which are peculiar to this
    edition of Polo’s work, and which it is difficult to assign to any one
    but himself, <span class="sidenote">Genuine statements peculiar to Ramusio.</span>we may note the specification of the woods east of Yezd as
    composed of <em>date trees</em> (<a href="#Page_88">vol. i pp. 88–89</a>); the unmistakable allusion
    to the subterranean irrigation channels of Persia (<a href="#Page_123">p. 123</a>); the accurate
    explanation of the term <em>Mulehet</em> applied to the sect of Assassins (<a href="#Page_139">pp.
    139–142</a>); the mention of the Lake (Sirikul?) on the plateau of Pamer, of
    the wolves that prey on the wild sheep, and of the piles of wild rams’
    horns used as landmarks in the snow (<a href="#Page_171">pp. 171–177</a>). To the description of
    the Tibetan Yak, which is in all the texts, Ramusio’s version alone adds
    a fact probably not recorded again till the present century, viz., that
    it is the practice to cross the Yak with the common cow (<a href="#Page_274">p. 274</a>). Ramusio
    alone notices the prevalence of <em>goître</em> at Yarkand, confirmed by recent
    travellers (<a href="#Page_187">i. p. 187</a>); the vermilion seal of the Great Kaan imprinted on
    the paper-currency, which may be seen in our plate of a Chinese note (<a href="#i426">p.
    426</a>); the variation in Chinese dialects (ii. p. 236); the division of the
    hulls of junks into water-tight compartments (ii. p. 249); the introduction
    into China from Egypt of the art of refining sugar (ii. p. 226). Ramusio’s
    account of the position of the city of Sindafu (Ch’êng-tu fu) encompassed
    and intersected by many branches of a great river (ii. p. 40), is much
    more just than that in the old text, which speaks of but one river through
    the middle of the city. The intelligent notices of the Kaan’s charities as
    originated by his adoption of “idolatry” or Buddhism; of the astrological
    superstitions of the Chinese, and of the manners and character of the
    latter nation, are found in Ramusio alone. To whom but Marco himself, or
    one of his party, can we refer the brief but vivid picture of the delicious
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i99"><i>99</i></span>atmosphere and scenery of the Badakhshan plateaux (<a href="#Page_158">i. p. 158</a>), and of the
    benefit that Messer Marco’s health derived from a visit to them? In this
    version alone again we have an account of the oppressions exercised by
    Kúblái’s Mahomedan Minister Ahmad, telling how the Cathayans rose against
    him and murdered him, with the addition that Messer Marco was on the spot
    when all this happened. Now not only is the whole story in substantial
    accordance with the Chinese Annals, even to the name of the chief
    conspirator,<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but those annals also tell of the courageous frankness of
    “Polo, assessor of the Privy Council,” in opening the Kaan’s eyes to the truth.</p>

  <p>Many more such examples might be adduced, but these will suffice. It is
    true that many of the passages peculiar to the Ramusian version, and
    indeed the whole version, show a freer utterance and more of a literary
    faculty than we should attribute to Polo, judging from the earlier texts.
    It is possible, however, that this may be almost, if not entirely, due
    to the fact that the version is the result of a double translation, and
    probably of an editorial fusion of several documents; processes in which
    angularities of expression would be dissolved.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i100"><i>100</i></span></p>

  <p>63. Though difficulties will certainly remain,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> the most probable
    explanation of the origin of this text seems to me to be some such<span class="sidenote">Hypothesis of the sources of the Ramusian Version.</span>
    hypothesis as the following:—I suppose that Polo in his latter years added
    with his own hand supplementary notes and reminiscences, marginally or
    otherwise, to a copy of his book; that these, perhaps in his lifetime, more
    probably after his death, were digested and translated into Latin;<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and
    that Ramusio, or some friend of his, in retranslating and fusing them with
    Pipino’s version for the <em>Navigationi</em>, made those minor modifications in
    names and other matters which we have already noticed. The mere facts of
    digestion from memoranda and double translation would account for a good
    deal of unintentional corruption.</p>

  <p>That more than one version was employed in the composition of Ramusio’s
    edition we have curious proof in at least one passage of the latter.
    We have pointed out at <a href="#Page_410">p. 410</a> of this volume a curious example of
    misunderstanding of the old French <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i101"><i>101</i></span>Text, a passage in which the term <i lang="fr">Roi
    des Pelaines</i>, or “King of Furs,” is applied to the Sable, and which in the
    Crusca has been converted into an imaginary Tartar phrase <em>Leroide pelame</em>,
    or as Pipino makes it <em>Rondes</em> (another indication that Pipino’s Version
    and the Crusca passed through a common medium). But Ramusio exhibits <em>both</em>
    the true reading and the perversion: “<i lang="it">E li Tartari la chiamano</i> Regina
    delle pelli” (there is the true reading), “<i lang="it">E gli animali si chiamano</i>
    Rondes” (and there the perverted one).</p>

  <p>We may further remark that Ramusio’s version betrays indications that one
    of its bases either was in the Venetian dialect, or had passed through
    that dialect; for a good many of the names appear in Venetian forms, <i>e.g.</i>,
    substituting the <em>z</em> for the sound of <em>ch</em>, <em>j</em>, or soft <em>g</em>, as in <em>Goza</em>,
    <em>Zorzania</em>, <em>Zagatay</em>, <em>Gonza</em> (for Giogiu), <em>Quenzanfu</em>, <em>Coiganzu</em>, <em>Tapinzu</em>,
    <em>Zipangu</em>, <em>Ziamba</em>.</p>

  <p>64. To sum up. It is, I think, beyond reasonable dispute that we have, in
    what we call the Geographic Text, as nearly as may be an exact transcript
    of the<span class="sidenote">Summary in regard to Text of Polo.</span> Traveller’s words as originally taken down in the prison of Genoa.
    We have again in the MSS. of the second type an edition pruned and refined,
    probably under instructions from Marco Polo, but not with any critical
    exactness. And lastly, I believe, that we have, imbedded in the Ramusian
    edition, the supplementary recollections of the Traveller, noted down
    at a later period of his life, but perplexed by repeated translation,
    compilation, and editorial mishandling.</p>

  <p>And the most important remaining problem in regard to the text of Polo’s
    work is the discovery of the supplemental manuscript from which Ramusio
    derived those passages which are found only in his edition. It is possible
    that it may still exist, but no trace of it in anything like completeness
    has yet been found; though when my task was all but done I discovered a
    small part of the Ramusian peculiarities in a MS. at Venice.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i102"><i>102</i></span></p>

  <p>65. Whilst upon this subject of manuscripts of our Author, I will give
    some particulars regarding a very curious one, containing a version in the
    <em>Irish</em> language.</p>

  <p>This remarkable document is found in the <cite>Book of Lismore</cite>, belonging to
    the Duke of Devonshire. That magnificent book,<span class="sidenote">Notice of a curious Irish Version of Polo.</span> finely written on vellum
    of the largest size, was discovered in 1814, enclosed in a wooden box,
    along with a superb crozier, on opening a closed doorway in the castle
    of Lismore. It contained Lives of the Saints, the (Romance) History of
    Charlemagne, the History of the Lombards, histories and tales of Irish
    wars, etc., etc., and among the other matter this version of Marco Polo. A
    full account of the Book and its mutilations will be found in <cite>O’Curry’s
    Lectures on the MS. Materials of Ancient Irish History</cite>, p. 196 <i>seqq.</i>,
    Dublin, 1861. The <cite>Book of Lismore</cite> was written about 1460 for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i103"><i>103</i></span>Finghin
    MacCarthy and his wife Catharine Fitzgerald, daughter of Gerald, Eighth
    Earl of Desmond.</p>

  <p>The date of the Translation of Polo is not known, but it may be supposed
    to have been executed about the above date, probably in the Monastery of
    Lismore (county of Waterford).</p>

  <p>From the extracts that have been translated for me, it is obvious that
    the version was made, with an astounding freedom certainly, from Friar
    Francesco Pipino’s Latin.</p>

  <p>Both beginning and end are missing. But what remains opens thus; compare it
    with Friar Pipino’s real prologue as we give it in the Appendix!<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

    <p>————“Kings and chieftains of that city. There was then in the city a
      princely Friar in the habit of St. Francis, named Franciscus, who was
      versed in many languages. He was brought to the place where those
      nobles were, and they requested of him to translate the book from
      the Tartar (!) into the Latin language. ‘It is an abomination to
      me,’ said he, ‘to devote my mind or labour to works of Idolatry and
      Irreligion.’ They entreated him again. ‘It shall be done,’ said he;
      ‘for though it be an irreligious narrative that is related therein,
      yet the things are miracles of the True God; and every one who hears
      this much against the Holy Faith shall pray fervently for their
      conversion. And he who will not pray shall waste the vigour of his
      body to convert them.’ I am not in dread of this Book of Marcus, for
      there is no lie in it. My eyes beheld him bringing the relics of the
      holy Church with him, and he left [his testimony], whilst tasting of
      death, that it was true. And Marcus was a devout man. What is there
      in it, then, but that Franciscus translated this Book of Marcus from
      the Tartar into Latin; and the years of the Lord at that time were
      fifteen years, two score, two hundred, and one thousand” (1255).</p>

  <p>It then describes <em>Armein Bec</em> (Little Armenia), <em>Armein Mor</em> (Great
    Armenia), <em>Musul</em>, <em>Taurisius</em>, <em>Persida</em>, <em>Camandi</em>, and so forth. The last

      kings, who are Unbelievers and Idolaters. And the kingdom of <span class="smcap">Aden</span>; a

    <p>“The king of Abaschia once took a notion to make a pilgrimage to
      the Sepulchre of Jesus. ‘Not at all,’ said his nobles and warriors
      to him, ‘for we should be afraid lest the infidels through whose
      territories you would have to pass, should kill you. There is a Holy
      Bishop with you,’ said they; ‘send him to the Sepulchre of Jesus, and

      <p>These passages, and many more that might be quoted, seem to me to
        demonstrate (1) that the Latin and the Crusca have had a common
        original, and (2) that this original was an Italian version from the
        French.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_292" href="#FNanchor_292" class="label">[2]</a> Thus the <cite>Pucci</cite> MS. at Florence, in the passage regarding
      the Golden King (vol. ii. p. 17) which begins in G.&nbsp;T. “<em>Lequel fist
      faire</em> jadis <em>un rois qe fu apellés le Roi Dor</em>,” renders “<em>Lo quale
      fa fare</em> Jaddis <em>uno re</em>,” a mistake which is not in the Crusca
      nor in the Latin, and seems to imply derivation from the French
      directly, or by some other channel (<cite>Baldelli Boni</cite>).</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_293" href="#FNanchor_293" class="label">[3]</a> In the Prologue (<a href="#Page_34">vol. i. p. 34</a>) this class of MSS. alone
      names the King of England.

      <p>In the account of the Battle with Nayan (<a href="#Page_337">i. p. 337</a>) this class alone
        speaks of the two-stringed instruments which the Tartars played
        whilst awaiting the signal for battle. But the circumstance appears
        elsewhere in the G.&nbsp;T. (p. 250).</p>

      <p>In the chapter on <em>Malabar</em> (vol. ii. p. 390), it is said that the
        ships which go with cargoes towards Alexandria are not one-tenth of
        those that go to the further East. This is not in the older French.</p>

      <p>In the chapter on <em>Coilun</em> (ii. p. 375), we have a notice of the
        Columbine ginger so celebrated in the Middle Ages, which is also
        absent from the older text.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_294" href="#FNanchor_294" class="label">[4]</a> See vol. ii. p. 439. It is, however, remarkable that a like
      mistake is made about the Persian Gulf (see <a href="#Page_63">i. 63, 64</a>). Perhaps Polo
      <em>thought</em> in Persian, in which the word <em>darya</em> means either <em>sea</em>
      or a <em>large river</em>. The same habit and the ambiguity of the Persian
      <em>sher</em> led him probably to his confusion of lions and tigers (see <a href="#Page_397">i. 397</a>).</div>

      the correcter <em>Bolgana, Cocacin, Quiacatu, Cobinan</em>, where the
      G.&nbsp;T. presents both (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_i86">p. <i>86</i></a>). They read <em>Esanar</em> for the
      correct <em>Etzina</em>; <em>Chascun</em> for <em>Casvin</em>; <em>Achalet</em> for <em>Acbalec</em>;
      <em>Sardansu</em> for <em>Sindafu</em>, <em>Kayteu, Kayton, Sarcon</em> for <em>Zaiton</em> or
      <em>Caiton</em>; <em>Soucat</em> for <em>Locac</em>; <em>Falec</em> for <em>Ferlec</em>, and so on,
      the worse instead of the better. They make the <em>Mer Occeane</em> into
      <em>Mer Occident</em>; the wild asses (<em>asnes</em>) of the Kerman Desert into
      wild geese (<em>oes</em>); the <em>escoillez</em> of Bengal (ii. p. 115) into
      <em>escoliers</em>; the <em>giraffes</em> of Africa into <em>girofles</em>, or cloves,
      etc., etc.</div>

      <p>At the end of the Prologue the Geographic Text reads simply:—</p>

      <p>“Or puis que je voz ai contez tot le fat dou prolegue ensi con voz
        avés oï, adonc (commencerai) le Livre.”</p>

      <p>Whilst the Geographic Latin has:—</p>

      <p>“<em>Postquam recitavimus et diximus facta et condictiones morum,
        itinerum</em> et ea quae nobis contigerunt per vias, <em>incipiemus dicere
        ea quae vidimus. Et primo dicemus de Minore Hermenia</em>.”</p>

      <p>And Pipino:—</p>

        accedamus. Primo autem Armeniam Minorem describemus breviter</em>.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_300" href="#FNanchor_300" class="label">[10]</a> Friar Francesco Pipino of Bologna, a Dominican, is known
      also as the author of a lengthy chronicle from the time of the Frank
      Kings down to 1314; of a Latin Translation of the French History
      of the Conquest of the Holy Land, by Bernard the Treasurer; and of
      a short Itinerary of a Pilgrimage to Palestine in 1320. Extracts
      from the Chronicle, and the version of Bernard, are printed in
      Muratori’s Collection. As Pipino states himself to have executed
      the translation of Polo by order of his Superiors, it is probable
      that the task was set him at a general chapter of the order which
      was held at Bologna in 1315. (See <cite>Muratori</cite>, IX. 583; and <cite>Quétif,
      Script. Ord. Praed.</cite> I. 539). We do not know why Ramusio assigned
      the translation specifically to 1320, but he may have had grounds.</div>

    <div class="footnote">

      <a id="Footnote_302" href="#FNanchor_302" class="label">[12]</a> C. Dickens somewhere narrates the history of the
      equivalents for a sovereign as changed and rechanged at every
      frontier on a continental tour. The final equivalent received at
      Dover on his return was some 12 or 13 shillings; a fair parallel to
      the comparative value of the first and last copies in the circle of
      translation.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_303" href="#FNanchor_303" class="label">[13]</a> The Ramusios were a family of note in literature for
      several generations. Paolo, the father of Gian Battista, came
      originally from Rimini to Venice in 1458, and had a great repute as
      a jurist, besides being a littérateur of some eminence, as was also
      his younger brother Girolamo. G. B. Ramusio was born at Treviso in
      1485, and early entered the public service. In 1533 he became one
      of the Secretaries of the Council of X. He was especially devoted
      to geographical studies, and had a school for such studies in his
      house. He retired eventually from public duties, and lived at Villa
      Ramusia, near Padua. He died in the latter city, 10th July, 1557,
      but was buried at Venice in the Church of S. Maria dell’Orto. There
      was a portrait of him by Paul Veronese in the Hall of the Great
      Council, but it perished in the fire of 1577; and that which is now
      seen in the Sala dello Scudo is, like the companion portrait of
      Marco Polo, imaginary. Paolo Ramusio, his son, was the author of the
      well-known History of the Capture of Constantinople. (<cite>Cicogna</cite>, II. 310 <i>seqq.</i>)</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_304" href="#FNanchor_304" class="label">[14]</a> The old French texts were unknown in Marsden’s time. Hence
      this question did not present itself to him.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_305" href="#FNanchor_305" class="label">[15]</a> <em>Wangcheu</em> in the Chinese Annals; <em>Vanchu</em> in Ramusio. I
      assume that Polo’s <em>Vanchu</em> was pronounced as in English; for in
      Venetian the <em>ch</em> very often has that sound. But I confess that I
      can adduce no other instance in Ramusio where I suppose it to have
      this sound, except in the initial sound of <em>Chinchitalas</em> and twice
      in <em>Choiach</em> (see II. 364).

      <p>Professor Bianconi, who has treated the questions connected with the
        Texts of Polo with honest enthusiasm and laborious detail, will
        admit nothing genuine in the Ramusian interpolations beyond the
        preservation of some <em>oral traditions</em> of Polo’s supplementary
        recollections. But such a theory is out of the question in face of a
        chapter like that on Ahmad.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_306" href="#FNanchor_306" class="label">[16]</a> Old Purchas appears to have greatly relished Ramusio’s
      comparative lucidity: “I found (says he) this Booke translated
      by Master Hakluyt out of the Latine (<i>i.e.</i> among Hakluyt’s MS.
      collections). But where the blind leade the blind both fall: as
      here the corrupt <em>Latine</em> could not but yeeld a corruption of truth
      in <em>English</em>. Ramusio, Secretarie to the <em>Decemviri</em> in <em>Venice</em>,
      found a better Copie and published the same, whence you have the
      worke in manner new: so renewed, that I have found the Proverbe
      true, that it is better to pull downe an old house and to build it
      anew, then to repaire it; as I also should have done, had I knowne
      that which in the event I found. The <em>Latine</em> is Latten, compared to
      <em>Ramusio’s</em> Gold. And hee which hath the <em>Latine</em> hath but <em>Marco
      Polo’s</em> carkasse or not so much, but a few bones, yea, sometimes
      stones rather then bones; things divers, averse, adverse, perverted
      in manner, disjoynted in manner, beyond beliefe. I have seene some
      Authors maymed, but never any so mangled and so mingled, so present
      and so absent, as this vulgar <em>Latine</em> of <em>Marco Polo</em>; not so like
      himselfe, as the Three <em>Polo’s</em> were at their returne to <em>Venice</em>,
      where none knew them.... Much are wee beholden to <em>Ramusio</em>, for
      restoring this <em>Pole</em> and Load-starre of <em>Asia</em>, out of that mirie
      poole or puddle in which he lay drouned.” (III. p. 65.)</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_307" href="#FNanchor_307" class="label">[17]</a> Of these difficulties the following are some of the more
      prominent:—

      <p>1. The mention of the death of Kúblái (see note 7, <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a> of this
        volume), whilst throughout the book Polo speaks of Kúblái as if
        still reigning.</p>

      <p>2. Mr. Hugh Murray objects that whilst in the old texts Polo appears
        to look on Kúblái with reverence as a faultless Prince, in the
        Ramusian we find passages of an opposite tendency, as in the chapter
        about Ahmad.</p>

      <p>3. The same editor points to the manner in which one of the Ramusian
        additions represents the traveller to have visited the Palace of the
        Chinese Kings at Kinsay, which he conceives to be inconsistent with
        Marco’s position as an official of the Mongol Government. (See vol.
        ii. p. 208.)</p>

      <p>If we could conceive the Ramusian additions to have been originally
        notes written by old Maffeo Polo on his nephew’s book, this
        hypothesis would remove almost all difficulty.</p>

      <p>One passage in Ramusio seems to bear a reference to the date at
        which these interpolated notes were amalgamated with the original.
        In the chapter on Samarkand (<a href="#Page_191">i. p. 191</a>) the conversion of the
        Prince Chagatai is said in the old texts to have occurred “not a
        great while ago” (<i lang="fr">il ne a encore grament de tens</i>). But in Ramusio
        the supposed event is fixed at “one hundred and twenty-five years
        since.” This number could not have been uttered with reference to
        1298, the year of the dictation at Genoa, nor to any year of Polo’s
        own life. Hence it is probable that the original note contained a
        date or definite term which was altered by the compiler to suit the
        date of his own compilation, some time in the 14th century.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_308" href="#FNanchor_308" class="label">[18]</a> In the first edition of Ramusio the preface contained the
      following passage, which is omitted from the succeeding editions;
      but as even the first edition was issued after Ramusio’s own death,
      I do not see that any stress can be laid on this:

      <p>“A copy of the Book of Marco Polo, as it was originally written
        in Latin, marvellously old, and perhaps directly copied from the
        original as it came from M. Marco’s own hand, has been often
        consulted by me and compared with that which we now publish, having
        been lent me by a nobleman of this city, belonging to the Ca’
        Ghisi.”</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_309" href="#FNanchor_309" class="label">[19]</a> For a moment I thought I had been lucky enough to light on
      a part of the missing original of Ramusio in the Barberini Library
      at Rome. A fragment of a Venetian version in that library (No. 56
      in our list of MSS.) bore on the fly-leaf the title “<i lang="it">Alcuni primi
      capi del Libro di S. Marco Polo, copiati dall esemplare manoscritto
      di <span class="gespertt1">PAOLO RANNUSIO</span>.</i>” But it proved to be of no importance. One brief
      passage of those which have been thought peculiar to Ramusio, viz.,
      the reference to the Martyrdom of St. Blaize at Sebaste (see <a href="#Page_43">p. 43</a>
      of this volume), is found also in the Geographic Latin.

      <p>It was pointed out by Lazari, that another passage (<a href="#Page_60">vol. i. p. 60</a>)
        of those otherwise peculiar to Ramusio, is found in a somewhat
        abridged Latin version in a MS. which belonged to the late eminent
        antiquary Emanuel Cicogna. (See List in Appendix F, No. 35.)
        This fact induced me when at Venice in 1870 to examine the MS.
        throughout, and, though I could give little time to it, the result
        was very curious.</p>

      <p>I find that this MS. contains, not one only, but at least <em>seven</em>
        of the passages otherwise peculiar to Ramusio, and must have been
        one of the elements that went to the formation of his text. Yet of
        his more important interpolations, such as the chapter on Ahmad’s
        oppressions and the additional matter on the City of Kinsay, there
        is no indication. The seven passages alluded to are as follows; the
        words corresponding to Ramusian peculiarities are in italics, the
        references are to my own volumes.</p>

      <p>1. In the chapter on Georgia:</p>

      <p><span lang="la">“Mare quod dicitur Gheluchelan <em>vel <span class="gespertt1">ABACU</span></em>”</span>....</p>

  <hr class="d40" />
  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XIi">XI. <span class="smcap">Some Estimate of the Character of Polo and His Book.</span></h4>

  <p>66. That Marco Polo has been so universally recognised as the King of
    Mediæval Travellers is due rather to the width of his experience, <span class="sidenote">Grounds of Polo’s pre-eminence among mediæval travellers.</span>the vast
    compass of his journeys, and the romantic nature of his personal history,
    than to transcendent superiority of character or capacity.</p>

  <p>The generation immediately preceding his own has bequeathed to us, in the
    Report of the Franciscan Friar William de Rubruquis,<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> on the Mission with
    which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i105"><i>105</i></span>St. Lewis charged him to the Tartar Courts, the narrative of one
    great journey, which, in its rich detail, its vivid pictures, its acuteness
    of observation and strong good sense, seems to me to form a Book of Travels
    of much higher claims than <em>any one series</em> of Polo’s chapters; a book,
    indeed, which has never had justice done to it, for it has few superiors in
    the whole Library of Travel.</p>

  <p>Enthusiastic Biographers, beginning with Ramusio, have placed Polo on the
    same platform with Columbus. But where has our Venetian Traveller left
    behind him any trace of the genius and lofty enthusiasm, the ardent and
    justified previsions which mark the great Admiral as one of the lights
    of the human race?<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is a juster praise that the spur which his Book
    eventually gave to geographical studies, and the beacons which it hung out
    at the Eastern extremities of the Earth helped to guide the aims, though
    scarcely to kindle the fire, of the greater son of the rival Republic. His
    work was at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i106"><i>106</i></span>least a link in the Providential chain which at last dragged
    the New World to light.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>67. Surely Marco’s real, indisputable, and, in their kind, unique claims
    to glory may suffice! <span class="sidenote">His true claims to glory.</span><em>He was the first Traveller to trace a route across
    the whole longitude of</em> <span class="smcap">Asia</span>, <em>naming and describing kingdom after kingdom
    which he had seen with his own eyes; the Deserts of</em> <span class="smcap">Persia</span>, <em>the flowering
    plateaux and wild gorges of</em> <span class="smcap">Badakhshan</span>, <em>the jade-bearing rivers of</em>
    <span class="smcap">Khotan</span>, <em>the</em> <span class="smcap">Mongolian</span> <em>Steppes, cradle of the power that had so lately
    threatened to swallow up Christendom, the new and brilliant Court that had
    been established at</em> <span class="smcap">Cambaluc</span>: <em>The first Traveller to reveal</em> <span class="smcap"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i107"><i>107</i></span>China</span> <em>in
    all its wealth and vastness, its mighty rivers, its huge cities, its rich
    manufactures, its swarming population, the inconceivably vast fleets that
    quickened its seas and its inland waters; to tell us of the nations on its
    borders with all their eccentricities of manners and worship; of</em> <span class="smcap">Tibet</span>
    <em>with its sordid devotees; of</em> <span class="smcap">Burma</span> <em>with its golden pagodas and their
    tinkling crowns; of</em> <span class="smcap">Laos</span>, <em>of</em> <span class="smcap">Siam</span>, <em>of</em> <span class="smcap">Cochin China</span>, <em>of</em> <span class="smcap">Japan</span>, <em>the
    Eastern Thule, with its rosy pearls and golden-roofed palaces; the first to
    speak of that Museum of Beauty and Wonder, still so imperfectly ransacked,
    the</em> <span class="smcap">Indian Archipelago</span>, <em>source of those aromatics then so highly prized
    and whose origin was so dark; of</em> <span class="smcap">Java</span> <em>the Pearl of Islands; of</em> <span class="smcap">Sumatra</span>
    <em>with its many kings, its strange costly products, and its cannibal races;
    of the naked savages of</em> <span class="smcap">Nicobar</span> <em>and</em> <span class="smcap">Andaman</span>; <em>of</em> <span class="smcap">Ceylon</span> <em>the Isle of
    Gems with its Sacred Mountain and its Tomb of Adam; of</em> <span class="smcap">India the Great</span>,
    <em>not as a dream-land of Alexandrian fables, but as a country seen and
    partially explored, with its virtuous Brahmans, its obscene ascetics,
    its diamonds and the strange tales of their acquisition, its sea-beds of
    pearl, and its powerful sun; the first in mediæval times to give any
    distinct account of the secluded Christian Empire of</em> <span class="smcap">Abyssinia</span>, <em>and the
    semi-Christian Island of</em> <span class="smcap">Socotra</span>; <em>to speak, though indeed dimly, of</em>
    <span class="smcap">Zangibar</span> <em>with its negroes and its ivory, and of the vast and distant</em>
    <span class="smcap">Madagascar</span>, <em>bordering on the Dark Ocean of the South, with its Ruc and
    other monstrosities; and, in a remotely opposite region, of</em> <span class="smcap">Siberia</span> <em>and
    the</em> <span class="smcap">Arctic Ocean</span>, <em>of dog-sledges, white bears, and reindeer-riding
    Tunguses</em>.</p>

  <p>That all this rich catalogue of discoveries should belong to the
    revelations of one Man and one Book is surely ample ground enough to
    account for and to justify the Author’s high place in the roll of Fame, and
    there can be no need to exaggerate his greatness, or to invest him with
    imaginary attributes.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p>68. What manner of man was Ser Marco? It is a question hard to answer.
    <span class="sidenote">His personal attributes seen but dimly.</span>
    Some critics cry out against personal detail in books of Travel; but as
    regards him who would not welcome a little more egotism! In his Book
    impersonality is carried to excess; and we are often <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i108"><i>108</i></span>driven to discern
    by indirect and doubtful indications alone, whether he is speaking of a
    place from personal knowledge or only from hearsay. In truth, though there
    are delightful exceptions, and nearly every part of the book suggests
    interesting questions, a desperate meagreness and baldness does extend over
    considerable tracts of the story. In fact his book reminds us sometimes
    of his own description of Khorasan:—“<i lang="fr">On chevauche par beaus plains et
    belles costieres, là où il a moult beaus herbages et bonne pasture et fruis
    assez.... Et aucune fois y treuve l’en un desert de soixante milles ou de
    mains, esquels desers ne treuve l’en point d’eaue; mais la convient porter
    o lui!</i>”</p>

  <p>Still, some shadowy image of the man may be seen in the Book; a practical
    man, brave, shrewd, prudent, keen in affairs, and never losing his interest
    in mercantile details, very fond of the chase, sparing of speech; with
    a deep wondering respect for Saints, even though they be Pagan Saints,
    and their asceticism, but a contempt for Patarins and such like, whose
    consciences would not run in customary grooves, and on his own part a keen
    appreciation of the World’s pomps and vanities. See, on the one hand, his
    undisguised admiration of the hard life and long fastings of Sakya Muni;
    and on the other how enthusiastic he gets in speaking of the great Kaan’s
    command of the good things of the world, but above all of his matchless
    opportunities of sport!<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

  <p>Of humour there are hardly any signs in his Book. His almost solitary
    joke (I know but one more, and it pertains to the οὐκ ἀνήκοντα)
    occurs in speaking of the Kaan’s paper-money when he observes that Kúblái
    might be said to have the true Philosopher’s Stone, for he made his money
    at pleasure out of the bark of Trees.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Even the oddest eccentricities of
    outlandish tribes scarcely seem to disturb his gravity; as when he relates
    in his brief way of the people called Gold-Teeth on the frontier of Burma,
    that ludicrous custom which Mr. Tylor has so well illustrated under the
    name of the <em>Couvade</em>. There is more savour of laughter in the few lines
    of a Greek Epic, which relate precisely the same custom of a people on the
    Euxine:—</p>

  </div>

  <p>69. Of scientific notions, such as we find in the unveracious Maundevile,
    we have no trace in truthful Marco. The former, “lying with a
    circumstance,”<span class="sidenote">Absence of scientific notions.</span> tells us boldly that he was in 33° of South Latitude; the
    latter is full of wonder that some of the Indian Islands where he had been
    lay so far to the south that you lost sight of the Pole-star. When it rises
    again on his horizon he estimates the Latitude by the Pole-star’s being so
    many <em>cubits</em> high. So the gallant Baber speaks of the sun having mounted
    <em>spear-high</em> when the onset of battle began at Paniput. Such expressions
    convey no notion at all to such as have had their ideas sophisticated by
    angular perceptions of altitude, but similar expressions are common among
    Orientals,<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and indeed I have heard them from educated Englishmen. In
    another place Marco states regarding certain islands in the Northern Ocean
    that they lie so very far to the north that in going thither one actually
    leaves the Pole-star a trifle behind towards the south; a statement to
    which we know only one parallel, to wit, in the voyage of that adventurous
    Dutch skipper who told Master Moxon, King Charles II.’s Hydrographer, that
    he had sailed two degrees beyond the Pole!</p>

  <p>70. The Book, however, is full of bearings and distances, and I have
    thought it worth while to construct a map from its indications, in order to
    get some approximation to<span class="sidenote">Map constructed on Polo’s data.</span> Polo’s own idea of the face of that world which
    he had traversed so extensively. There are three allusions to maps in the
    course of his work (II. 245, 312, 424).</p>

  <p>In his own bearings, at least on land journeys, he usually carries us along
    a great general traverse line, without much caring about small changes of
    direction. Thus on the great outward journey from the frontier of Persia to
    that of China the line runs almost continuously “<i lang="fr">entre Levant et Grec</i>”
    or E.N.E. In his journey from Cambaluc or Peking to Mien or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i110"><i>110</i></span>Burma, it is
    always <em>Ponent</em> or W.; and in that from Peking to Zayton in Fo-kien, the
    port of embarkation for India, it is <em>Sceloc</em> or S.E. The line of bearings
    in which he deviates most widely from truth is that of the cities on the
    Arabian Coast from Aden to Hormuz, which he makes to run steadily <em>vers
    Maistre</em> or N.W., a conception which it has not been very easy to realise
    on the map.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p>71. In the early part of the Book we are told that Marco acquired several
    of the languages current in the Mongol Empire,<span class="sidenote">Singular omissions of Polo in regard to China; Historical
    inaccuracies.</span> and no less than four
    written characters. We have discussed what these are likely to have been
    (<a href="#Page_28">i. pp. 28–29</a>), and have given a decided opinion that Chinese was not
    one of them. Besides intrinsic improbability, and positive indications
    of Marco’s ignorance of Chinese, in no respect is his book so defective
    as in regard to Chinese manners and peculiarities. The Great Wall is
    never mentioned, though we have shown reason for believing that it was
    in his mind when one passage of his book was dictated.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The use of
    Tea, though he travelled through the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i111"><i>111</i></span>Tea districts of Fo-kien, is never
    mentioned;<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the compressed feet of the women and the employment of the
    fishing cormorant (both mentioned by Friar Odoric, the contemporary of his
    later years), artificial egg-hatching, printing of books (though the notice
    of this art seems positively challenged in his account of paper-money),
    besides a score of remarkable arts and customs which one would have
    expected to recur to his memory, are never alluded to. Neither does he
    speak of the great characteristic of the Chinese writing. It is difficult
    to account for these omissions, especially considering the comparative
    fulness with which he treats the manners of the Tartars and of the Southern
    Hindoos; but the impression remains that his associations in China were
    chiefly with foreigners. Wherever the place he speaks of had a Tartar
    or Persian name he uses that rather than the Chinese one. Thus <em>Cathay</em>,
    <em>Cambaluc</em>, <em>Pulisanghin</em>, <em>Tangut</em>, <em>Chagannor</em>, <em>Saianfu</em>, <em>Kenjanfu</em>, <em>Tenduc</em>,
    <em>Acbalec</em>, <em>Carajan</em>, <em>Zardandan</em>, <em>Zayton</em>, <em>Kemenfu</em>, <em>Brius</em>, <em>Caramoran</em>, <em>Chorcha</em>,
    <em>Juju</em>, are all Mongol, Turki, or Persian forms, though all have Chinese
    equivalents.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

  <p>In reference to the then recent history of Asia, Marco is often inaccurate,
    <i>e.g.</i> in his account of the death of Chinghiz, in the list of his
    successors, and in his statement of the relationship <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i112"><i>112</i></span>between notable
    members of that House.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But the most perplexing knot in the whole book
    lies in the interesting account which he gives of the Siege of Sayanfu or
    Siang-yang, during the subjugation of Southern China by Kúblái. I have
    entered on this matter in the notes (vol. ii. p. 167), and will only say
    here that M. Pauthier’s solution of the difficulty is no solution, being
    absolutely inconsistent with the story as told by Marco himself, and that I
    see none; though I have so much faith in Marco’s veracity that I am loath
    to believe that the facts admit of no reconciliation.</p>

  <p>Our faint attempt to appreciate some of Marco’s qualities, as gathered
    from his work, will seem far below the very high estimates that have been
    pronounced, not only by some who have delighted rather to enlarge upon his
    frame than to make themselves acquainted with his work,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but also by
    persons whose studies and opinions have been worthy of all respect. Our
    estimate, however, does not abate a jot of our intense interest in his Book
    and affection for his memory. And we have a strong feeling that, owing
    partly to his reticence, and partly to the great disadvantages under which
    the Book was committed to writing, we have in it a singularly imperfect
    image of the Man.</p>

  <p>72. A question naturally suggests itself, how far Polo’s narrative, at
    <span class="sidenote">Was Polo’s Book materially affected by the Scribe Rusticiano?</span>
    least in its expression, was modified by passing under the pen of a
    professed littérateur of somewhat humble claims, such as Rusticiano was.
    The case is not a singular one, and in our own day the ill-judged use
    of such assistance has been fatal to the reputation of an adventurous
    Traveller.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i113"><i>113</i></span></p>

  <p>We have, however, already expressed our own view that in the Geographic
    Text we have the nearest possible approach to a photographic impression of
    Marco’s oral narrative. If there be an exception to this we should seek
    it in the descriptions of battles, in which we find the narrator to fall
    constantly into a certain vein of bombastic commonplaces, which look like
    the stock phrases of a professed romancer, and which indeed have a strong
    resemblance to the actual phraseology of certain metrical romances.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
    Whether this feature be due to Rusticiano I cannot say, but I have not been
    able to trace anything of the same character in a cursory inspection of
    some of his romance-compilations. Still one finds it impossible to conceive
    of our sober and reticent Messer Marco pacing the floor of his Genoese
    dungeon, and seven times over rolling out this magniloquent bombast,
    with sufficient deliberation to be overtaken by the pen of the faithful
    amanuensis!</p>

  <p>73. On the other hand, though Marco, who had left home at fifteen years of
    age, naturally shows very few signs of reading, <span class="sidenote">Marco’s reading embraced the Alexandrian Romances. Examples.</span>there are indications that
    he had read romances, especially those dealing with the fabulous adventures
    of Alexander.</p>

  <p>To these he refers explicitly or tacitly in his notices of the Irongate
    and of Gog and Magog, in his allusions to the marriage of Alexander with
    Darius’s daughter, and to the battle between those two heroes, and in his
    repeated mention of the <em>Arbre Sol</em> or <em>Arbre Sec</em> on the Khorasan frontier.</p>

  <p>The key to these allusions is to be found in that Legendary History of
    Alexander, entirely distinct from the true history of the Macedonian
    Conqueror, which in great measure took the place of the latter in the
    imagination of East and West for more than a thousand years. This fabulous
    history is believed to be of Græco-Egyptian origin, and in its earliest
    extant compiled form, in the Greek of the Pseudo-Callisthenes, can be
    traced back to at least about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 200. From the Greek its marvels spread
    eastward at an early date; some part at least of their matter was known
    to Moses of Chorene, in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i114"><i>114</i></span>5th century;<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> they were translated into
    Armenian, Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac; and were reproduced in the verses
    of Firdusi and various other Persian Poets; spreading eventually even to
    the Indian Archipelago, and finding utterance in Malay and Siamese. At an
    early date they had been rendered into Latin by Julius Valerius; but this
    work had probably been lost sight of, and it was in the 10th century that
    they were re-imported from Byzantium to Italy by the Archpriest Leo, who
    had gone as Envoy to the Eastern Capital from John Duke of Campania.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
    Romantic histories on this foundation, in verse and prose, became diffused
    in all the languages of Western Europe, from Spain to Scandinavia,
    rivalling in popularity the romantic cycles of the Round Table or of
    Charlemagne. Nor did this popularity cease till the 16th century was well
    advanced.</p>

  <p>The heads of most of the Mediæval Travellers were crammed with these
    fables as genuine history.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> And by the help of that community of
    legend on this subject which they found wherever Mahomedan literature
    had spread, Alexander Magnus was to be traced everywhere in Asia. Friar
    Odoric found Tana, near Bombay, to be the veritable City of King Porus;
    John Marignolli’s vainglory led him to imitate King Alexander in setting
    up a marble column “in the corner of the world over against Paradise,”
    <i>i.e.</i> somewhere on the coast of Travancore; whilst Sir John Maundevile,
    with a cheaper ambition, borrowed wonders from the Travels of Alexander
    to adorn his own. Nay, even in after days, when the Portuguese stumbled
    with amazement on those vast ruins in Camboja, which have so lately become
    familiar to us through the works of Mouhot, Thomson, and Garnier, they
    ascribed them to Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

  <p>Prominent in all these stories is the tale of Alexander’s shutting up a
    score of impure nations, at the head of which were Gog and Magog, within a
    barrier of impassable mountains, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i115"><i>115</i></span>there to await the latter days; a legend
    with which the disturbed mind of Europe not unnaturally connected that
    cataclysm of unheard-of Pagans that seemed about to deluge Christendom in
    the first half of the 13th century. In these stories also the beautiful
    Roxana, who becomes the bride of Alexander, is <em>Darius’s</em> daughter,
    bequeathed to his arms by the dying monarch. Conspicuous among them again
    is the Legend of the Oracular Trees of the Sun and Moon, which with audible
    voice foretell the place and manner of Alexander’s death. With this
    Alexandrian legend some of the later forms of the story had mixed up one
    of Christian origin about the Dry Tree, <em>L’Arbre Sec</em>. And they had also
    adopted the Oriental story of the Land of Darkness and the mode of escape
    from it, which Polo relates at p. 484 of vol. ii.</p>

  <p>74. We have seen in the most probable interpretation of the nickname
    <em>Milioni</em> that Polo’s popular reputation in his lifetime was of
    a<span class="sidenote">Injustice long done to Polo. Singular modern instance.</span>
    questionable kind; and a contemporary chronicler, already quoted, has told
    us how on his death-bed the Traveller was begged by anxious friends to
    retract his extraordinary stories.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> A little later one who copied the
    Book “<i lang="it">per passare tempo e malinconia</i>” says frankly that he puts no faith
    in it.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Sir Thomas Brown is content “to carry a wary eye” in reading
    “Paulus Venetus”; but others of our countrymen in the last century express
    strong doubts whether he ever was in Tartary or China.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Marden’s edition
    might well have extinguished the last sparks of scepticism.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Hammer
    meant praise in calling Polo “<i lang="de">der Vater orientalischer Hodogetik</i>,” in
    spite of the uncouthness of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i116"><i>116</i></span>the eulogy. But another grave German writer,
    ten years after Marsden’s publication, put forth in a serious book that the
    whole story was a clumsy imposture!<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

  <div class="footnotes">
    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_311" href="#FNanchor_311" class="label">[1]</a> M. d’Avezac has refuted the common supposition that this
      admirable traveller was a native of Brabant.

      <p>The form <em>Rubruquis</em> of the name of the traveller William de Rubruk
        has been habitually used in this book, perhaps without sufficient
        consideration, but it is the most familiar in England, from its
        use by Hakluyt and Purchas. The former, who first published the
        narrative, professedly printed from an imperfect MS. belonging to
        the Lord Lumley, which does not seem to be now known. But all the
        MSS. collated by Messrs. Francisque-Michel and Wright, in preparing
        their edition of the Traveller, call him simply Willelmus de Rubruc
        or Rubruk.</p>

      <p>Some old authors, apparently without the slightest ground, having
        called him <em>Risbroucke</em> and the like, it came to be assumed that he
        was a native of Ruysbroeck, a place in South Brabant.</p>

      <p>But there is a place still called <em>Rubrouck</em> in French Flanders.
        This is a commune containing about 1500 inhabitants, belonging to
        the Canton of Cassel and <i lang="fr">arrondissement</i> of Hazebrouck, in the
        Department du Nord. And we may take for granted, till facts are
        alleged against it, that <em>this</em> was the place from which the envoy
        of St. Lewis drew his origin. Many documents of the Middle Ages,
        referring expressly to this place Rubrouck, exist in the Library
        of St. Omer, and a detailed notice of them has been published by
        M. Edm. Coussemaker, of Lille. Several of these documents refer
        to persons bearing the same name as the Traveller, <i>e.g.</i>, in 1190,
        Thierry de Rubrouc; in 1202 and 1221, Gauthier du Rubrouc; in
        1250, Jean du Rubrouc; and in 1258, Woutermann de Rubrouc. It is
        reasonable to suppose that Friar William was of the same stock. See
        <cite>Bulletin de la Soc. de Géographie</cite>, 2nd vol. for 1868, pp. 569–570,
        in which there are some remarks on the subject by M. d’Avezac; and I
        am indebted to the kind courtesy of that eminent geographer himself
        for the indication of this reference and the main facts, as I had
        lost a note of my own on the subject.</p>

      <p>It seems a somewhat complex question whether a native even of
        <em>French</em> Flanders at that time should be necessarily claimable
        as a Frenchman;<a id="FNanchor_F" href="#Footnote_F" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> but no doubt on this point is alluded to by
        M. d’Avezac, so he probably had good ground for that assumption.
        [See also <cite>Yule’s</cite> article in the <cite>Encyclopædia Britannica</cite>, and
        <cite>Rockhill’s Rubruck</cite>, Int., p. xxxv.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      <p>That cross-grained Orientalist, I. J. Schmidt, on several occasions
        speaks contemptuously of this veracious and delightful traveller,
        whose evidence goes in the teeth of some of his crotchets. But I am
        glad to find that Professor Peschel takes a view similar to that
        expressed in the text: “The narrative of Ruysbroek [Rubruquis],
        almost immaculate in its freedom from fabulous insertions, may
        be indicated on account of its truth to nature as the greatest
        geographical masterpiece of the Middle Ages.” (<cite>Gesch. der
        Erdkunde</cite>, 1865, p. 151.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_312" href="#FNanchor_312" class="label">[2]</a> High as Marco’s name deserves to be set, his place is not
      beside the writer of such burning words as these addressed to
      Ferdinand and Isabella: “From the most tender age I went to sea, and
      to this day I have continued to do so. Whosoever devotes himself to
      this craft must desire to know the secrets of Nature here below. For
      40 years now have I thus been engaged, and wherever man has sailed
      hitherto on the face of the sea, thither have I sailed also. I have
      been in constant relation with men of learning, whether ecclesiastic
      or secular, Latins and Greeks, Jews and Moors, and men of many a
      sect besides. To accomplish this my longing (to know the Secrets
      of the World) I found the Lord favourable to my purposes; it is He
      who hath given me the needful disposition and understanding. He
      bestowed upon me abundantly the knowledge of seamanship: and of
      Astronomy He gave me enough to work withal, and so with Geometry
      and Arithmetic.... In the days of my youth I studied works of all
      kinds, history, chronicles, philosophy, and other arts, and to
      apprehend these the Lord opened my understanding. Under His manifest
      guidance I navigated hence to the Indies; for it was the Lord who
      gave me the will to accomplish that task, and it was in the ardour
      of that will that I came before your Highnesses. All those who heard
      of my project scouted and derided it; all the acquirements I have
      mentioned stood me in no stead; and if in your Highnesses, and in
      you alone, Faith and Constancy endured, to Whom are due the Lights
      that have enlightened you as well as me, but to the Holy Spirit?”
      (Quoted in <cite>Humboldt’s Examen Critique</cite>, I. 17, 18.)</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_313" href="#FNanchor_313" class="label">[3]</a> Libri, however, speaks too strongly when he says: “The
      finest of all the results due to the influence of Marco Polo is
      that of having stirred Columbus to the discovery of the New World.
      Columbus, jealous of Polo’s laurels, spent his life in preparing
      means to get to that Zipangu of which the Venetian traveller had
      told such great things; his desire was to reach China by sailing
      westward, and in his way he fell in with America.” (<cite>H. des Sciences
      Mathém.</cite> etc. II. 150.)

      <p>The fact seems to be that Columbus knew of Polo’s revelations only
        at second hand, from the letters of the Florentine Paolo Toscanelli
        and the like; and I cannot find that he <em>ever</em> refers to Polo by
        name. [How deep was the interest taken by Colombus in Marco Polo’s
        travels is shown by the numerous marginal notes of the Admiral in
        the printed copy of the latin version of Pipino kept at the Bib.
        Colombina at Seville. See <i>Appendix H</i>. p. 558.—H.&nbsp;C.] Though to
        the day of his death he was full of imaginations about Zipangu and
        the land of the Great Kaan as being in immediate proximity to his
        discoveries, these were but accidents of his great theory. It was
        the intense conviction he had acquired of the absolute smallness
        of the Earth, of the vast extension of Asia eastward, and of the
        consequent narrowness of the Western Ocean, on which his life’s
        project was based. This conviction he seems to have derived chiefly
        from the works of Cardinal Pierre d’Ailly. But the latter borrowed
        his collected arguments from Roger Bacon, who has stated them,
        erroneous as they are, very forcibly in his <cite>Opus Majus</cite> (p. 137),
        as Humboldt has noticed in his <cite>Examen</cite> (vol. i. p. 64). The Spanish
        historian Mariana makes a strange jumble of the alleged guides
        of Columbus, saying that some ascribed his convictions to “the
        information given by <em>one Marco Polo, a Florentine Physician!</em>”
        (“como otros dizen, por aviso que le dio <em>un cierto Marco Polo,
        Medico Florentin</em>;” <cite>Hist. de España</cite>, lib. xxvi. cap 3). Toscanelli
        is called by Columbus <em>Maestro Paulo</em>, which seems to have led to
        this mistake; see Sign. <cite>G. Uzielli</cite>, in <cite>Boll. della Soc. Geog.

      <a id="Footnote_319" href="#FNanchor_319" class="label">[9]</a> The map, perhaps, gives too favourable an idea of Marco’s
      geographical conceptions. For in such a construction much has to be
      supplied for which there are no data, and that is apt to take mould
      from modern knowledge. Just as in the book illustrations of ninety
      years ago we find that Princesses of Abyssinia, damsels of Otaheite,
      and Beauties of Mary Stuart’s Court have all somehow a savour of the
      high waists, low foreheads, and tight garments of 1810.

      <p>We are told that Prince Pedro of Portugal in 1426 received from the
        Signory of Venice a map which was supposed to be either an original
        or a copy of one by Marco Polo’s own hand. (<cite>Major’s P. Henry</cite>, p.
        62.) There is no evidence to justify any absolute expression of
        disbelief; and if any map-maker with the spirit of the author of the
        Carta Catalana then dwelt in Venice, Polo certainly could not have
        gone to his grave uncatechised. But I should suspect the map to have
        been a copy of the old one that existed in the Sala dello Scudo of
        the Ducal Palace.</p>

      <p>The maps now to be seen painted on the walls of that Hall, and on
        which Polo’s route is marked, are not of any great interest. But in
        the middle of the 15th century there was an old <i lang="la">Descriptio Orbis
        sive Mappamundus</i> in the Hall, and when the apartment was renewed
        in 1459 a decree of the Senate ordered that such a map should be
        repainted on the new walls. This also perished by a fire in 1483.
        On the motion of Ramusio, in the next century, four new maps were
        painted. These had become dingy and ragged, when, in 1762, the Doge
        Marco Foscarini caused them to be renewed by the painter Francesco
        Grisellini. He professed to have adhered closely to the old maps,
        but he certainly did not, as Morelli testifies. Eastern Asia looks
        as if based on a work of Ramusio’s age, but Western Asia is of
        undoubtedly modern character. (See <cite>Operetti di Iacopo Morelli</cite>,
        Ven. 1820, I. 299.)</p>

      would be most anticipated: In the archives of Barcelona no trace of
      the triumphal entry of Columbus into that city; <em>in Marco Polo no

      Mohammedan merchant Soleyman, who visited China about the middle of
      the 9th century. He states (<cite>Reinaud, Relation des Voyages faits
      par les Arabes et les Persans dans l’Inde et à la Chine</cite>, 1845, I.

      also in the supposed occasional use of Oriental state records, as in
      Herodotus’s accounts of the revenues of the satrapies, and of the

      branch of the R. S. of Science at Göttingen appears to have put
      forth as the subject of a prize Essay the Geography of the Travels
      of Carpini, Rubruquis, and especially of Marco Polo. (See <cite>L. of
      M. Polo</cite>, by <cite>Zurla</cite>, in <cite>Collezione di Vite e Ritratti d’Illustri
      Italiani</cite>. Pad. 1816.)</div>

      Bonn, 1829, vol. iv.

      <p>After speaking of the Missions of Pope Innocent IV. and St. Lewis,
        this author sketches the Travels of the Polos, and then proceeds:—“Such
        are the clumsily compiled contents of this ecclesiastical
        fiction (<cite>Kirchengeschichtlichen Dichtung</cite>) disguised as a Book
        of Travels, a thing devised generally in the spirit of the age,
        but specially in the interests of the Clergy and of Trade.... This
        compiler’s aim was analogous to that of the inventor of the Song
        of Roland, to kindle enthusiasm for the conversion of the Mongols,
        and so to facilitate commerce through their dominions.... Assuredly
        the Poli never got further than Great Bucharia, which was then
        reached by many Italian Travellers. What they have related of the
        regions of the Mongol Empire lying further east consists merely
        of recollections of the bazaar and travel-talk of traders from
        those countries; whilst the notices of India, Persia, Arabia, and
        Ethiopia, are borrowed from Arabic Works. The compiler no doubt
        carries his audacity in fiction a long way, when he makes his hero
        Marcus assert that he had been seventeen years in Kúblái’s service,”
        etc. etc. (pp. 360–362).</p>

      <p>In the French edition of <cite>Malcolm’s History of Persia</cite> (II. 141),
        Marco is styled “<i lang="fr">prêtre Venetien</i>”! I do not know whether this is
        due to Sir John or to the translator.</p>

      <p>[Polo is also called “a Venetian Priest,” in a note, vol. i., p.
        409, of the original edition of London, 1815, 2 vols., 4to.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XIIi">XII. <span class="smcap">Contemporary Recognition of Polo and his Book.</span></h4>

  <p>75. But we must return for a little to Polo’s own times. Ramusio states,
    as we have seen,<span class="sidenote">How far was there diffusion of his Book in his own day?</span> that immediately after the first commission of Polo’s
    narrative to writing (in Latin as he imagined), many copies of it were
    made, it was translated into the vulgar tongue, and in a few months all
    Italy was full of it.</p>

  <p>The few facts that we can collect do not justify this view of the rapid and
    diffused renown of the Traveller and his Book. The number of MSS. of the
    latter dating from the 14th century is no doubt considerable, but a large
    proportion of these are of Pipino’s condensed Latin Translation, which
    was not put forth, if we can trust Ramusio, till 1320, and certainly not
    much earlier. The whole number of MSS. in various languages that we have
    been able to register, amounts to about eighty. I find it difficult to
    obtain statistical data as to the comparative number of copies of different
    works existing in manuscript. With <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i117"><i>117</i></span>Dante’s great Poem, of which there are
    reckoned close upon 500 MSS.,<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> comparison would be inappropriate. But
    of the Travels of Friar Odoric, a poor work indeed beside Marco Polo’s, I
    reckoned thirty-nine MSS., and could now add at least three more to the
    list. [I described seventy-three in my edition of <cite>Odoric</cite>.—H.&nbsp;C.] Also I
    find that of the nearly contemporary work of Brunetto Latini, the <cite>Tresor</cite>,
    a sort of condensed Encyclopædia of knowledge, but a work which one would
    scarcely have expected to approach the popularity of Polo’s Book, the
    Editor enumerates some fifty MSS. And from the great frequency with which
    one encounters in Catalogues both MSS. and early printed editions of Sir
    John Maundevile, I should suppose that the lying wonders of our English
    Knight had a far greater popularity and more extensive diffusion than the
    veracious and more sober marvels of Polo.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> To Southern Italy Polo’s
    popularity certainly does not seem at any time to have extended. I cannot
    learn that any MS. of his Book exists in any Library of the late Kingdom of
    Naples or in Sicily.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

  <p>Dante, who lived for twenty-three years after Marco’s work <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i118"><i>118</i></span>was written, and
    who touches so many things in the seen and unseen Worlds, never alludes
    to Polo, nor I think to anything that can be connected with his Book. I
    believe that no mention of <em>Cathay</em> occurs in the <cite>Divina Commedia</cite>. That
    distant region is indeed mentioned more than once in the poems of a humbler
    contemporary, Francesco da Barberino, but there is nothing in his allusions
    besides this name to suggest any knowledge of Polo’s work.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

  <p>Neither can I discover any trace of Polo or his work in that of his
    contemporary and countryman, Marino Sanudo the Elder, though this worthy
    is well acquainted with the somewhat later work of Hayton, and many of
    the subjects which he touches in his own book would seem to challenge a
    reference to Marco’s labours.</p>

  <p>76. Of contemporary or nearly contemporary references to our Traveller by
    <span class="sidenote">Contemporary references to Polo.</span>
    name, the following are all that I can produce, and none of them are new.</p>

  <p>First there is the notice regarding his presentation of his book to
    Thibault de Cepoy, of which we need say no more (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_68">p. <i>68</i></a>).</p>

  <p>Next there is the Preface to Friar Pipino’s Translation, which we give
    at length in the Appendix (E) to these notices. The phraseology of this
    appears to imply that Marco was still alive, and this agrees with the date
    assigned to the work by Ramusio. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i119"><i>119</i></span>Pipino was also the author of a Chronicle,
    of which a part was printed by Muratori, and this contains chapters on the
    Tartar wars, the destruction of the Old Man of the Mountain, etc., derived
    from Polo. A passage not printed by Muratori has been extracted by Prof.
    Bianconi from a MS. of this Chronicle in the Modena Library, and runs as
    follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“The matters which follow, concerning the magnificence of the Tartar
      Emperors, whom in their language they call <em>Cham</em> as we have said,
      are related by Marcus Paulus the Venetian in a certain Book of his
      which has been translated by me into Latin out of the Lombardic
      Vernacular. Having gained the notice of the Emperor himself and
      become attached to his service, he passed nearly 27 years in the
      Tartar countries.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Again we have that mention of Marco by Friar Jacopo d’Acqui, which we have
    quoted in connection with his capture by the Genoese, at <a href="#Page_i54">p. <i>54</i></a>.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And the
    Florentine historian <span class="smcap">Giovanni Villani</span>,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> when alluding to the Tartars,
    says:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Let him who would make full acquaintance with their history examine
      the book of Friar Hayton, Lord of Colcos in Armenia, which he made at
      the instance of Pope Clement V., and also the Book called <em>Milione</em>
      which was made by Messer Marco Polo of Venice, who tells much about
      their power and dominion, having spent a long time among them. And
      so let us quit the Tartars and return to our subject, the History of
      Florence.”<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>77. Lastly, we learn from a curious passage in a medical work by <span class="smcap">Pietro
    of Abano</span>, a celebrated physician and philosopher,<span class="sidenote">Further contemporary references.</span> and a man of Polo’s own
    generation, that he was personally acquainted with the Traveller. In a
    discussion on the old notion of the non-habitability of the Equatorial
    regions, which Pietro controverts, he says:<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i120"><i>120</i></span></p>

  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In the country of the <span class="smcap">Zinghi</span> there is seen a star as big as a sack.
      I know a man who has seen it, and he told me it had a faint light
      like a piece of a cloud, and is always in the south.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> I have
      been told of this and other matters by <span class="smcap">Marco</span> the Venetian, the most
      extensive traveller and the most diligent inquirer whom I have ever
      known. He saw this same star under the Antarctic; he described it as
      having a great tail, and drew a figure of it <em>thus</em>. He also told
      me that he saw the Antarctic Pole at an altitude above the earth
      apparently equal to the length of a soldier’s lance, whilst the
      Arctic Pole was as much below the horizon. ’Tis from that place, he
      says, that they export to us camphor, lign-aloes, and brazil. He says
      the heat there is intense, and the habitations few. And these things
      he witnessed in a certain island at which he arrived by Sea. He tells
      me also that there are (wild?) men there, and also certain very great
      rams that have very coarse and stiff wool just like the bristles of
      our pigs.”<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In addition to these five I know no other contemporary references to Polo,
    nor indeed any other within the 14th century, though such there must surely
    be, excepting in a Chronicle written after the middle of that century by
    <span class="smcap">John</span> of <span class="smcap"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i121"><i>121</i></span>Ypres</span>, Abbot of St. Bertin, otherwise known as Friar John the
    Long, and himself a person of very high merit in the history of Travel,
    as a precursor of the Ramusios, Hakluyts and Purchases, for he collected
    together and translated (when needful) into French all of the most valuable
    works of Eastern Travel and Geography produced in the age immediately
    preceding his own.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> In his Chronicle the Abbot speaks at some length of
    the adventures of the Polo Family, concluding with a passage to which we
    have already had occasion to refer:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“And so Messers Nicolaus and Maffeus, with certain Tartars, were sent
      a second time to these parts; but Marcus Pauli was retained by the
      Emperor and employed in his military service, abiding with him for a
      space of 27 years. And the Cham, on account of his ability despatched
      him upon affairs of his to various parts of Tartary and India and the
      Islands, on which journeys he beheld many of the marvels of those
      regions. And concerning these he afterwards composed a book in the
      French vernacular, which said Book of Marvels, with others of the
      same kind, we do possess.” (<cite>Thesaur. Nov. Anecdot.</cite> III. 747.)</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>78. There is, however, a notable work which is ascribed to a rather early
    date in the 14th century, and which, though it contains no reference to
    Polo by name, shows a thorough acquaintance with his book, and borrows
    themes largely from it.<span class="sidenote">Curious borrowings from Polo in the Romance of Bauduin de
    Sebourc.</span> This is the poetical Romance of Bauduin de Sebourc,
    an exceedingly clever and vivacious production, partaking largely of that
    bantering, half-mocking spirit which is, I believe, characteristic of
    many of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i122"><i>122</i></span>later mediæval French Romances.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Bauduin is a knight who,
    after a very wild and loose youth, goes through an extraordinary series
    of adventures, displaying great faith and courage, and eventually becomes
    King of Jerusalem. I will cite some of the traits evidently derived from
    our Traveller, which I have met with in a short examination of this curious work.</p>

  <p>Bauduin, embarked on a dromond in the Indian Sea, is wrecked in the
    territory of Baudas, and near a city called Falise, which stands on the
    River of Baudas. The people of this city were an unbelieving race.</p>

  <p class="noindent">Baudin arrives when the king has been dead three days, and through dread
    of this custom all the people of the city are shut up in their houses. He
    enters an inn, and helps himself to a vast repast, having been fasting
    for three days. He is then seized and carried before the king, Polibans
    by name. We might have quoted this prince at <a href="#Page_i87">p. <i>87</i></a> as an instance of the
    diffusion of the French tongue:</p>

  <p class="noindent">Bauduin proposes to prove his Faith by fighting the prince, himself
    unarmed, the latter with all his arms. The prince agrees, but is rather
    dismayed at Bauduin’s confidence, and desires his followers, in case of
    his own death, to burn with him horses, armour, etc., asking at the same
    time which of them would consent to burn along with him, in order to be his
    companions in the other world:</p>

  <p>The story is, in fact, that which Marco relates of Samarkand.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The
    Caliph dies. His son hates the Christians. His people complain of the
    toleration of the Christians and their minister; but he says his father
    had pledged him not to interfere, and he dared not forswear himself. If,
    without <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i125"><i>125</i></span>doing so, he could do them an ill turn, he would gladly. The people
    then suggest their claim to the stone:</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The Caliph accordingly sends for Maistre Thumas, the Priest of the
    Christians, and tells him the stone must be given up:</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">Master Thomas, in great trouble, collects his flock, mounts the pulpit,
    and announces the calamity. Bauduin and his convert Polibans then arrive.
    Bauduin recommends confession, fasting, and prayer. They follow his advice,
    and on the third day the miracle occurs:</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The Caliph comes to see, and declares it to be the Devil’s doing. Seeing
    Polibans, who is his cousin, he hails him, but Polibans draws back, avowing
    his Christian faith. The Caliph in a rage has him off to prison. Bauduin
    becomes very ill, and has to sell his horse and arms. His disease is so
    offensive that he is thrust out of his hostel, and in his wretchedness
    sitting on a stone he still avows his faith, and confesses that even then
    he has not received his deserts. He goes to beg in the Christian <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i126"><i>126</i></span>quarter,
    and no one gives to him; but still his faith and love to God hold out:</p>

  <div class="center-container">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The cobler is charitable, gives him bread, shoes, and a grey coat that was
    a foot too short. He then asks Bauduin if he will not learn his trade; but
    that is too much for the knightly stomach:</p>

  <div class="center-container">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The Caliph now in his Council expresses his vexation about the miracle, and
    says he does not know how to disprove the faith of the Christians. A very
    sage old Saracen who knew Hebrew, and Latin, and some thirty languages,
    makes a suggestion, which is, in fact, that about the moving of the
    Mountain, as related by Marco Polo.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Master Thomas is sent for again,
    and told that they must transport the high mountain of <em>Thir</em> to the valley
    of <em>Joaquin</em>, which lies to the westward. He goes away in new despair and
    causes his clerk to <i lang="fr">sonner le clocke</i> for his people. Whilst they are
    weeping and wailing in the church, a voice is heard desiring them to seek a
    certain holy man who is at the good cobler’s, and to do him honour. God at
    his prayer will do a miracle. They go in procession to Bauduin, who thinks
    they are mocking him. They treat him as a saint, and strive to touch his
    old coat. At last he consents to pray along with the whole congregation.</p>

  <p>The Caliph is in his palace with his princes, taking his ease at a window.
    Suddenly he starts up exclaiming:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="fr">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“‘Seignour, par Mahoumet que j’aoure et tieng chier,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The Caliph is converted, releases Polibans, and is baptised, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i127"><i>127</i></span>taking the
    name of Bauduin, to whom he expresses his fear of the Viex de la Montagne
    with his <i lang="fr">Hauts-Assis</i>, telling anew the story of the Assassin’s Paradise,
    and so enlarges on the beauty of Ivorine that Bauduin is smitten, and his
    love heals his malady. Toleration is not learned however:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry" lang="fr">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Bauduins, li Califes, fist baptisier sa gent,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The Caliph gives up his kingdom to Bauduin, proposing to follow him to the
    Wars of Syria. And Bauduin presents the Kingdom to the Cobler.</p>

  <p>Bauduin, the Caliph, and Prince Polibans then proceed to visit the Mountain
    of the Old Man. The Caliph professes to him that they want help against
    Godfrey of Bouillon. The Viex says he does not give a <em>bouton</em> for Godfrey;
    he will send one of his <i lang="fr">Hauts-Assis</i> straight to his tent, and give him a
    great knife of steel between <i lang="fr">fie et poumon!</i></p>

  <p>After dinner they go out and witness the feat of devotion which we have
    quoted elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> They then see the Paradise and the lovely Ivorine,
    with whose beauty Bauduin is struck dumb. The lady had never smiled before;
    now she declares that he for whom she had long waited was come. Bauduin
    exclaims:</p>

  <div class="center-container">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">The Old One is vexed, but speaks pleasantly to his daughter, who replies
    with frightfully bad language, and declares herself to be a Christian. The
    father calls out to the Caliph to kill her. The Caliph pulls out a big
    knife and gives him a blow that nearly cuts him in two. The amiable Ivorine
    says she will go with Bauduin:</p>

  <p>We need not follow the story further, as I did not trace beyond this point
    any distinct derivation from our Traveller, with the exception of that
    allusion to the incombustible covering <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i128"><i>128</i></span>of the napkin of St. Veronica, which
    I have quoted at <a href="#Page_216">p. 216</a> of this volume. But including this, here are at
    least seven different themes borrowed from Marco Polo’s book, on which to
    be sure his poetical contemporary plays the most extraordinary variations.</p>

  <p>[78 <i>bis.</i>—In the third volume of <cite>The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer</cite>,
    Oxford, 1894, the Rev. Walter W. Skeat gives (pp. 372 <i>seqq.</i>)<span class="sidenote">Chaucer and Marco Polo.</span> an <cite>Account
    of the Sources of the Canterbury Tales</cite>. Regarding <cite>The Squieres Tales</cite>,
    he says that one of his sources was the Travels of Marco; Mr. Keighley in
    his <cite>Tales and Popular Fictions</cite>, published in 1834, at p. 76, distinctly
    derives Chaucer’s Tale from the travels of Marco Polo. (<cite>Skeat, l. c.</cite>, p.
    463, note.) I cannot quote all the arguments given by the Rev. W. W. Skeat
    to support his theory, pp. 463–477.</p>

  <p>Regarding the opinion of Professor Skeat of Chaucer’s indebtedness to Marco
    Polo, cf. <cite>Marco Polo and the Squire’s Tale</cite>, by Professor John Matthews
    Manly, vol. xi. of the <cite>Publications of the Modern Language Association
    of America</cite>, 1896, pp. 349–362. Mr. Manly says (p. 360): “It seems clear,
    upon reviewing the whole problem, that if Chaucer used Marco Polo’s
    narrative, he either carelessly or intentionally confused all the features
    of the setting that could possibly be confused, and retained not a single
    really characteristic trait of any person, place or event. It is only by
    twisting everything that any part of Chaucer’s story can be brought into
    relation with any part of Polo’s. To do this might be allowable, if any
    rational explanation could be given for Chaucer’s supposed treatment of his
    ‘author,’ or if there were any scarcity of sources from which Chaucer might
    have obtained as much information about Tartary as he seems really to have
    possessed; but such an explanation would be difficult to devise, and there
    is no such scarcity. Any one of half a dozen accessible accounts could be
    distorted into almost if not quite as great resemblance to the <cite>Squire’s
    Tale</cite> as Marco Polo’s can.”</p>

  <p>Mr. A. W. Pollard, in his edition of <cite>The Squire’s Tale</cite> (Lond.,
    1899) writes: “A very able paper, by Prof. J. M. Manly, demonstrates
    the needlessness of Prof. Skeat’s theory, which has introduced fresh
    complications into an already complicated story. My own belief is that,
    though we may illustrate the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i129"><i>129</i></span>Squire’s Tale from these old accounts of
    Tartary, and especially from Marco Polo, because he has been so well edited
    by Colonel Yule, there is very little probability that Chaucer consulted
    any of them. It is much more likely that he found these details where he
    found more important parts of his story, <i>i.e.</i> in some lost romance. But if
    we must suppose that he provided his own local colour, we have no right
    to pin him down to using Marco Polo to the exclusion of other accessible
    authorities.” Mr. Pollard adds in a note (p. xiii.): “There are some
    features in these narratives, <i>e.g.</i> the account of the gorgeous dresses worn
    at the Kaan’s feast, which Chaucer with his love of colour could hardly
    have helped reproducing if he had known them.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      <p>The author was born the year before Dante (1264), and though he
        lived to 1348 it is probable that the poems in question were written
        in his earlier years. <em>Cathay</em> was no doubt known by dim repute long
        before the final return of the Polos, both through the original
        journey of Nicolo and Maffeo, and by information gathered by the
        Missionary Friars. Indeed, in 1278 Pope Nicolas III., in consequence
        of information said to have come from Abaka Khan of Persia, that
        Kúblái was a baptised Christian, sent a party of Franciscans with a
        long letter to the Kaan <em>Quobley</em>, as he is termed. They never seem
        to have reached their destination. And in 1289 Nicolas IV. entrusted
        a similar mission to Friar John of Monte Corvino, which eventually
        led to very tangible results. Neither of the Papal letters, however,
        mentions <em>Cathay</em>. (See <cite>Mosheim</cite>, App. pp. 76 and 94.)</p>

      about those stars, and obstructed the view of them.” Also the Kachh

      <p>It is a question for which there is sufficient ground, whether the
        Persian Historians Rashiduddin and Wassáf, one or other or both,
        did not derive certain information that appears in their histories,
        from Marco Polo personally, he having spent many months in Persia,
        and at the Court of Tabriz, when either or both may have been there.
        Such passages as that about the Cotton-trees of Guzerat (vol. ii. p.
        393, and note), those about the horse trade with Maabar (id. p. 340,
        and note), about the brother-kings of that country (id. p. 331),
        about the naked savages of Necuveram (id. p. 306), about the wild
        people of Sumatra calling themselves subjects of the Great Kaan (id.
        pp. 285, 292, 293, 299), have so strong a resemblance to parallel
        passages in one or both of the above historians, as given in the
        first and third volumes of Elliot, that the probability, at least,
        of the Persian writers having derived their information from Polo
        might be fairly maintained.</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XIIIi">XIII. <span class="smcap">Nature of Polo’s Influence on Geographical Knowledge.</span></h4>

  <p>79. Marco Polo contributed such a vast amount of new facts to the knowledge
    <span class="sidenote">Tardy operation, and causes thereof.</span>
    of the Earth’s surface, that one might have expected his book to have had
    a sudden effect upon the Science of Geography: but no such result occurred
    speedily, nor was its beneficial effect of any long duration.</p>

  <p>No doubt several causes contributed to the slowness of its action upon the
    notions of Cosmographers, of which the unreal character attributed to the
    Book, as a collection of romantic marvels rather than of geographical and
    historical facts, may have been one, as Santarem urges. But the essential
    causes were no doubt the imperfect nature of publication before the
    invention of the press; the traditional character which clogged geography
    as well as all other branches of knowledge in the Middle Ages; and the
    entire absence of scientific principle in what passed for geography, so
    that there was no organ competent to the assimilation of a large mass of
    new knowledge.</p>

  <p>Of the action of the first cause no examples can be more striking than
    we find in the false conception of the Caspian as a gulf of the Ocean,
    entertained by Strabo, and the opposite error in regard to the Indian Sea
    held by Ptolemy, who regards it as an enclosed basin, when we contrast
    these with the correct <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i130"><i>130</i></span>ideas on both subjects possessed by Herodotus. The
    later Geographers no doubt knew his statements, but did not appreciate
    them, probably from not possessing the evidence on which they were based.</p>

  <p>80. As regards the second cause alleged, we may say that down nearly to
    the middle of the 15th century cosmographers, <span class="sidenote">General characteristics of Mediæval Cosmography.</span>as a rule, made scarcely
    any attempt to reform their maps by any elaborate search for new matter,
    or by lights that might be collected from recent travellers. Their world
    was in its outline that handed down by the traditions of their craft, as
    sanctioned by some Father of the Church, such as Orosius or Isidore, as
    sprinkled with a combination of classical and mediæval legend; Solinus
    being the great authority for the former. Almost universally the earth’s
    surface is represented as filling the greater part of a circular disk,
    rounded by the ocean; a fashion that already existed in the time of
    Aristotle and was ridiculed by him.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> No dogma of false geography was
    more persistent or more pernicious than this. Jerusalem occupies the
    central point, because it was found written in the Prophet Ezekiel: “<em>Haec
    dicit Dominus Deus: Ista est Jerusalem</em>, in medio gentium <em>posui eam, et
    in circuitu ejus terras</em>;”<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a declaration supposed to be corroborated
    by the Psalmist’s expression, regarded as prophetic of the death of Our
    Lord: “<em>Deus autem, Rex noster, ante secula operatus est salutem</em> in medio
    Terrae” (Ps. lxxiii. 12).<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Terrestrial <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i131"><i>131</i></span>Paradise was represented as
    occupying the extreme East, because it was found in Genesis that the Lord
    planted a garden eastward in Eden.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> <em>Gog and Magog</em> were set in the far
    north or north-east, because it was said again in Ezekiel: “<em>Ecce Ego super
    te Gog Principem capitis Mosoch et Thubal ... et ascendere te faciam de
    lateribus Aquilonis</em>,” whilst probably the topography of those mysterious
    nationalities was completed by a girdle of mountains out of the Alexandrian
    Fables. The loose and scanty nomenclature was mainly borrowed from Pliny
    or Mela through such Fathers as we have named; whilst vacant spaces
    were occupied by Amazons, Arimaspians, and the realm of Prester John. A
    favourite representation of the inhabited earth was this <img class="iglyph-a" src="images/i131a.png" alt="" />; a great
    O enclosing a <img class="iglyph-b" src="images/i131b.png" alt="T" />, which thus divides the circle in three parts; the greater
    or half-circle being Asia, the two quarter circles Europe and Africa.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
    These Maps were known to St. Augustine.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

  <p>81. Even Ptolemy seems to have been almost unknown; and indeed had his
    Geography been studied it might, with all its errors, have tended to some
    greater endeavours after accuracy.<span class="sidenote">Roger Bacon as a geographer.</span> Roger Bacon, whilst lamenting the
    exceeding deficiency of geographical knowledge in the Latin world, and
    purposing to essay an exacter distribution of countries, says he will not
    attempt to do so by latitude and longitude, for that is a system of which
    the Latins have learned <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i132"><i>132</i></span>nothing. He himself, whilst still somewhat burdened
    by the authoritative dicta of “saints and sages” of past times, ventures
    at least to criticise some of the latter, such as Pliny and Ptolemy, and
    declares his intention to have recourse to the information of those who
    have travelled most extensively over the Earth’s surface. And judging
    from the good use he makes, in his description of the northern parts of
    the world, of the Travels of Rubruquis, whom he had known and questioned,
    besides diligently studying his narrative,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> we might have expected much
    in Geography from this great man, had similar materials been available to
    him for other parts of the earth. He did attempt a map with mathematical
    determination of places, but it has not been preserved.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

  <p>It may be said with general truth that the world-maps current up to the
    end of the 13th century had more analogy to the mythical cosmography of
    the Hindus than to any thing properly geographical. Both, no doubt, were
    originally based in the main on real features. In the Hindu cosmography
    these genuine features are symmetrised as in a kaleidoscope; in the
    European cartography they are squeezed together in a manner that one can
    only compare to a pig in brawn. Here and there some feature strangely
    compressed and distorted is just recognisable. A splendid example of this
    kind of map is that famous one at Hereford, executed about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1275,
    of which a facsimile has lately been published, accompanied by a highly
    meritorious illustrative Essay.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <p>82. Among the Arabs many able men, from the early days of Islám, took an
    interest in Geography, and devoted labour to geographical compilations, in
    which they often made use of their own observations, of the itineraries of
    travellers, and of other fresh knowledge. But somehow or other their maps
    were always far behind their books. Though they appear to have had an early
    translation of Ptolemy, and elaborate Tables of Latitudes and Longitudes
    form a prominent feature in many of their geographical treatises, there
    appears to be no Arabic map in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i133"><i>133</i></span>existence, laid down with meridians and
    parallels; whilst <em>all</em> of their best known maps are on the old system
    of the circular disk. This apparent incapacity for map-making appears to
    have acted as a heavy drag and bar upon progress in Geography among the
    Arabs, notwithstanding its early promise among them, and in spite of the
    application to its furtherance of the great intellects of some (such as Abu
    Rihán al-Biruni), and of the indefatigable spirit of travel and omnivorous
    curiosity of others (such as Mas’udi).</p>

  <p>83. Some distinct trace of acquaintance with the Arabian Geography is to be
    found in the World-Map of Marino Sanudo the Elder,<span class="sidenote">Marino Sanudo the Elder.</span> constructed between 1300
    and 1320; and this may be regarded as an exceptionally favourable specimen
    of the cosmography in vogue, for the author was a diligent investigator
    and compiler, who evidently took a considerable interest in geographical
    questions, and had a strong enjoyment and appreciation of a map.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Nor
    is the map in question without some result of these characteristics. His
    representation of Europe, Northern Africa, Syria, Asia Minor, Arabia and
    its two gulfs, is a fair approximation to general facts; his collected
    knowledge has enabled him to locate, with more or less of general truth,
    Georgia, the Iron Gates, Cathay, the Plain of Moghan, Euphrates and Tigris,
    Persia, Bagdad, Kais, Aden (though on the wrong side of the Red Sea),
    Abyssinia (<em>Habesh</em>), Zangibar (<em>Zinz</em>), Jidda (Zede), etc. But after all
    the traditional forms are too strong for him. Jerusalem is still the centre
    of the disk of the habitable earth, so that the distance is as great from
    Syria to Gades in the extreme West, as from Syria to the India Interior
    of Prester John which terminates the extreme East. And Africa beyond the
    Arabian Gulf is carried, according to the Arabian modification of Ptolemy’s
    misconception, far to the eastward until it almost meets the prominent
    shores of India.</p>

  <p>84. The first genuine mediæval attempt at a geographical construction that
    I know of, absolutely free from the traditional <em>idola</em>, is the Map of the
    known World from the Portulano <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i134"><i>134</i></span>Mediceo (in the Laurentian Library), of
    which an extract is engraved in the atlas of Baldelli-Boni’s Polo. I need
    not describe it, however,<span class="sidenote">The Catalan Map of 1375, the most complete mediæval embodiment
    of Polo’s Geography.</span> because I cannot satisfy myself that it makes
    much use of Polo’s contributions, and its facts have been embodied in a
    more ambitious work of the next generation, the celebrated Catalan Map of
    1375 in the great Library of Paris. This also, but on a larger scale and
    in a more comprehensive manner, is an honest endeavour to represent the
    known world on the basis of collected facts, casting aside all theories
    pseudo-scientific or pseudo-theological; and a very remarkable work it
    is. In this map it seems to me Marco Polo’s influence, I will not say
    on geography, but on map-making, is seen to the greatest advantage. His
    Book is the basis of the Map as regards Central and Further Asia, and
    partially as regards India. His names are often sadly perverted, and it
    is not always easy to understand the view that the compiler took of his
    itineraries. Still we have Cathay admirably placed in the true position
    of China, as a great Empire filling the south-east of Asia. The Eastern
    Peninsula of India is indeed absent altogether, but the Peninsula of Hither
    India is for the first time in the History of Geography represented with
    a fair approximation to its correct form and position,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and Sumatra
    also (<em>Jaua</em>) is not badly placed. Carajan, Vocian, Mien, and Bangala, are
    located with a happy conception of their relation to Cathay and to India.
    Many details in India foreign to Polo’s book,<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and some in Cathay (as
    well as in Turkestan and Siberia, which have been entirely derived from
    other sources) have been embodied in the Map. But the study of his Book
    has, I conceive, been essentially the basis of those great portions which I
    have specified, and the additional matter has not been in mass sufficient
    to perplex the compiler. Hence we really see <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i135"><i>135</i></span>in this Map something like
    the idea of Asia that the Traveller himself would have presented, had he
    bequeathed a Map to us.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp63" id="f134">
    <img class="w100" src="images/f134.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">Part of the Catalan Map (1375).</div>
  </div>

  <p>[Some years ago, I made a special study of the Far East in the Catalan Map
    (<cite>L’Extrême-Orient dans l’Atlas catalan de Charles V.</cite>, Paris, 1895), and
    I have come to the conclusion that the cartographer’s knowledge of Eastern
    Asia is drawn almost entirely from Marco Polo. We give a reproduction of
    part of the Catalan Map.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <p>85. In the following age we find more frequent indications that Polo’s book
    was diffused and read. And now that the spirit of discovery began to stir,<span class="sidenote">Confusions in Cartography of the 16th century, from the
    endeavour to combine new and old information.</span>
    it was apparently regarded in a juster light as a Book of Facts, and not
    as a mere <i lang="fr">Romman du Grant Kaan</i>.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> But in fact this age produced new
    supplies of crude information in greater abundance than the knowledge of
    geographers was prepared to digest or co-ordinate, and the consequence is
    that the magnificent Work of Fra Mauro (1459), though the result of immense
    labour in the collection of facts and the endeavour to combine them, really
    gives a considerably less accurate idea of Asia than that which the Catalan
    Map had afforded.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

  <p>And when at a still later date the great burst of discovery eastward and
    westward took effect, the results of all attempts to combine the new
    knowledge with the old was most unhappy. The first and crudest forms of
    such combinations attempted to realise the ideas of Columbus regarding
    the identity of his discoveries with the regions of the Great Kaan’s
    dominion;<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but even after <span class="smcap">America</span> had vindicated its independent
    position on the surface of the globe, and the new <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i136"><i>136</i></span>knowledge of the
    Portuguese had introduced <span class="smcap">China</span> where the Catalan Map of the 14th century
    had presented <span class="smcap">Cathay</span>, the latter country, with the whole of Polo’s
    nomenclature, was shoved away to the north, forming a separate system.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
    Henceforward the influence of Polo’s work on maps was simply injurious;
    and when to his nomenclature was added a sprinkling of Ptolemy’s, as was
    usual throughout the 16th century, the result was a most extraordinary
    hotch-potch, conveying no approximation to any consistent representation of facts.</p>

  <p>Thus, in a map of 1522,<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> running the eye along the north of Europe
    and Asia from West to East, we find the following succession of names:
    Groenlandia, or Greenland, as a great peninsula overlapping that of
    Norvegia and Suecia; Livonia, Plescovia and Moscovia, Tartaria bounded
    on the South by <i lang="la">Scithia extra Imaum</i>, and on the East, by the Rivers
    <em>Ochardes</em> and <em>Bautisis</em> (out of Ptolemy), which are made to flow into
    the Arctic Sea. South of these are <em>Aureacithis</em> and <em>Asmirea</em> (Ptolemy’s
    <em>Auxacitis</em> and <em>Asmiræa</em>), and <em>Serica Regio</em>. Then following the
    northern coast <em>Balor Regio</em>,<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <em>Judei Clausi</em>, <i>i.e.</i> the Ten Tribes who
    are constantly associated or confounded with the Shut-up Nations of Gog
    and Magog. These impinge upon the River <em>Polisacus</em>, flowing into the
    Northern Ocean in Lat. 75°, but which is in fact no other than Polo’s
    <em>Pulisanghin</em>!<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Immediately south of this is <em>Tholomon Provincia</em>
    (Polo’s again), and on the coast <em>Tangut</em>, <em>Cathaya</em>, the Rivers
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i137"><i>137</i></span><em>Caramoran</em> and <em>Oman</em> (a misreading of Polo’s <em>Quian</em>), <em>Quinsay</em> and
    <em>Mangi</em>.</p>

  <p>86. The Maps of Mercator (1587) and Magini (1597) are similar in character,
    but more elaborate, introducing China as a separate system. <span class="sidenote">Gradual disappearance of Polo’s nomenclature.</span>Such indeed
    also is Blaeu’s Map (1663) excepting that Ptolemy’s contributions are
    reduced to one or two.</p>

  <p>In Sanson’s Map (1659) the data of Polo and the mediæval Travellers are
    more cautiously handled, but a new element of confusion is introduced in
    the form of numerous features derived from Edrisi.</p>

  <p>It is scarcely worth while to follow the matter further. With the increase
    of knowledge of Northern Asia from the Russian side, and that of China from
    the Maps of Martini, followed by the surveys of the Jesuits, and with the
    real science brought to bear on Asiatic Geography by such men as De l’Isle
    and D’Anville, mere traditional nomenclature gradually disappeared. And
    the task which the study of Polo has provided for the geographers of later
    days has been chiefly that of determining the true localities that his book
    describes under obsolete or corrupted names.</p>

  <p>[My late illustrious friend, Baron <cite>A. E. Nordenskiöld</cite>, who has devoted
    much time and labour to the study of Marco Polo (see his <cite>Periplus</cite>,
    Stockholm, 1897), and published a facsimile edition of one of the French
    MSS. kept in the Stockholm Royal Library (see vol. ii. <cite>Bibliography</cite>,
    p. 570), has given to <cite>The Geographical Journal</cite> for April, 1899, pp.
    396–406, a paper on <cite>The Influence of the “Travels of Marco Polo” on Jacobo
    Gastaldi’s Maps of Asia</cite>. He writes (p. 398) that as far as he knows,
    none “of the many learned men who have devoted their attention to the
    discoveries of Marco Polo, have been able to refer to any maps in which all
    or almost all those places mentioned by Marco Polo are given. All friends
    of the history of geography will therefore be glad to hear that such an
    atlas from the middle of the sixteenth century really does exist, viz.
    Gastaldi’s ‘Prima, seconda e terza parte dell’Asia.’” All the names of
    places in Ramusio’s Marco Polo are introduced in the maps of Asia of Jacobo
    Gastaldi (1561). Cf. <cite>Periplus</cite>, liv., lv., and lvi.</p>

  <p>I may refer to what both Yule and myself say <i>supra</i> of the Catalan Map.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_i138"><i>138</i></span></p>

  <p>87. Before concluding, it may be desirable to say a few words on the
    subject of important knowledge other than geographical, <span class="sidenote">Alleged introduction of Block-printed Books into Europe by Marco
    Polo.</span>which various
    persons have supposed that Marco Polo must have introduced from Eastern
    Asia to Europe.</p>

  <p>Respecting the mariner’s compass and gunpowder I shall say nothing, as no
    one now, I believe, imagines Marco to have had anything to do with their
    introduction. But from a highly respectable source in recent years we have
    seen the introduction of Block-printing into Europe connected with the name
    of our Traveller. The circumstances are stated as follows:<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“In the beginning of the 15th century a man named Pamphilo Castaldi,
      of Feltre ... was employed by the Seignory or Government of the
      Republic, to engross deeds and public edicts of various kinds ...
      the initial letters at the commencement of the writing being usually
      ornamented with red ink, or illuminated in gold and colours.</p>

    <p>“According to Sansovino, certain stamps or types had been invented
      some time previously by Pietro di Natali, Bishop of Aquilœa.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
      These were made at Murano of glass, and were used to stamp or print
      the outline of the large initial letters of public documents, which
      were afterwards filled up by hand.... Pamphilo Castaldi improved
      on these glass types, by having others made of wood or metal, and
      having seen several Chinese books which the famous traveller Marco
      Polo had brought from China, and of which the entire text was printed
      with wooden blocks, he caused moveable wooden types to be made, each
      type containing a single letter; and with these he printed several
      broadsides and single leaves, at Venice, in the year 1426. Some of
      these single sheets are said to be preserved among the archives at
      Feltre....</p>

    <p>“The tradition continues that John Faust, of Mayence ... became
      acquainted with Castaldi, and passed some time with him, at his
      <cite>Scriptorium</cite>, ... at Feltre;”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">and in short developed from the knowledge so acquired the great invention
    of printing. Mr. Curzon goes on to say that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i139"><i>139</i></span>Panfilo Castaldi was born in
    1398, and died in 1490, and that he gives the story as he found it in an
    article written by Dr. Jacopo Facen, of Feltre, in a (Venetian?) newspaper
    called <cite>Il Gondoliere</cite>, No. 103, of 27th December, 1843.</p>

  <p>In a later paper Mr. Curzon thus recurs to the subject:<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Though none of the early block-books have dates affixed to them,
      many of them are with reason supposed to be more ancient than any
      books printed with moveable types. Their resemblance to Chinese
      block-books is so exact, that they would almost seem to be copied
      from the books commonly used in China. <em>The impressions are taken off
      on one side of the paper only, and in binding, both the Chinese, and
      ancient German, or Dutch block-books, the blank sides of the pages
      are placed opposite each other</em>, and sometimes pasted together....
      The impressions are not taken off with printer’s ink, but <em>with a
      brown paint or colour, of a much thinner description, more in the
      nature of Indian ink, as we call it, which is used in printing
      Chinese books</em>. Altogether the German and Oriental block-books
      are so precisely alike, in almost every respect, that ... we must
      suppose that the process of printing then must have been copied from
      ancient Chinese specimens, brought from that country by some early
      travellers, whose names have not been handed down to our times.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="noindent">The writer then refers to the tradition about <em>Guttemberg</em> (so it is
    stated on this occasion, not Faust) having learned Castaldi’s art, etc.,
    mentioning a circumstance which he supposes to indicate that Guttemberg
    had relations with Venice; and appears to assent to the probability of the
    story of the art having been founded on specimens brought home by Marco
    Polo.</p>

  <p>This story was in recent years diligently propagated in Northern Italy, and
    resulted in the erection at Feltre of a public statue of Panfilo Castaldi,
    bearing this inscription (besides others of like tenor):—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">“<em>To Panfilo Castaldi the illustrious Inventor of Movable Printing
      Types, Italy renders this Tribute of Honour, too long deferred.</em>”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the first edition of this book I devoted a special note to the exposure
    of the worthlessness of the evidence for this story.<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This note was,
    with the present Essay, translated and published at Venice by Comm.
    Berchet, but this challenge to the supporters <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i140"><i>140</i></span>of the patriotic romance, so
    far as I have heard, brought none of them into the lists in its defence.</p>

  <p>But since Castaldi has got his statue from the printers of Lombardy, would
    it not be mere equity that the mariners of Spain should set up a statue at
    Huelva to the Pilot Alonzo Sanchez of that port, who, according to Spanish
    historians, after discovering the New World, died in the house of Columbus
    at Terceira, and left the crafty Genoese to appropriate his journals, and
    rob him of his fame?</p>

  <p>Seriously; if anybody in Feltre cares for the real reputation of his native
    city, let him do his best to have that preposterous and discreditable
    fiction removed from the base of the statue. If Castaldi has deserved a
    statue on other and truer grounds let <em>him</em> stand; if not, let him be burnt
    into honest lime! I imagine that the original story that attracted Mr.
    Curzon was more <i lang="fr">jeu d’esprit</i> than anything else; but that the author,
    finding what a stone he had set rolling, did not venture to retract.</p>

  <p>88. Mr. Curzon’s own observations, which I have italicised about the
    resemblance of the two systems are, however, <span class="sidenote">Frequent opportunities for such introduction in the age
    following Polo’s.</span>very striking, and seem
    clearly to indicate the derivation of the art from China. But I should
    suppose that in the tradition, if there ever was any genuine tradition of
    the kind at Feltre (a circumstance worthy of all doubt), the name of Marco
    Polo was introduced merely because it was so prominent a name in Eastern
    Travel. The fact has been generally overlooked and forgotten<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> that, for
    many years in the course of the 14th century, not only were missionaries
    of the Roman Church and Houses of the Franciscan Order established in
    the chief cities of China, but a regular trade was carried on overland
    between Italy and China, by way of Tana (or Azov), Astracan, Otrar and
    Kamul, insomuch that instructions for the Italian merchant following that
    route form the two first chapters in the Mercantile Handbook of Balducci
    Pegolotti (<i>circa</i> 1340).<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Many a traveller besides Marco Polo might
    therefore have brought home the block-books. And this is the less to be
    ascribed to him because <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i141"><i>141</i></span>he so curiously omits to speak of the art of
    printing, when his subject seems absolutely to challenge its description.</p>

        The best solution that occurs to me is this: In looking at the world

        the <cite>Gesta Dei per Francos</cite>, you find geometrical lines laid down,

        a square inscribed in the circular disk of the Earth, with its
        diagonals passing through the Central Zion. The eye easily discerns
        in these a great M inscribed in the circle, with its middle angular
        point at Jerusalem. Gervasius of Tilbury (with some confusion in his
        mind between tropic and equinoxial, like that which Pliny makes in
        speaking of the Indian Mons Malleus) says that “some are of opinion
        that the Centre is in the place where the Lord spoke to the woman of
        Samaria at the well, for there, at the summer solstice, the noonday
        sun descends perpendicularly into the water of the well, casting no

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XIVi">XIV. <span class="smcap">Explanations regarding the Basis adopted for the present Translation.</span></h4>

  <p>89. It remains to say a few words regarding the basis adopted for our
    English version of the Traveller’s record.</p>

  <p>Ramusio’s recension was that which Marsden selected for translation. But at
    the date of his most meritorious publication nothing was known of the real
    <span class="sidenote">Text followed by Marsden and by Pauthier.</span>
    literary history of Polo’s Book, and no one was aware of the peculiar value
    and originality of the French manuscript texts, nor had Marsden seen any
    of them. A translation from one of those texts is a translation at first
    hand; a translation from Ramusio’s Italian is, as far as I can judge, the
    translation of a translated compilation from two or more translations, and
    therefore, whatever be the merits of its matter, inevitably carries us far
    away from the spirit and style of the original narrator. M. Pauthier, I
    think, did well in adopting for the text of his edition the MSS. which I
    have classed as of the second Type, the more as there had hitherto been no
    publication from those texts. But editing a text in the original language,
    and translating, are tasks substantially different in their demands.</p>

  <p>90. It will be clear from what has been said in the preceding pages that
    I should not regard as a fair or full representation of Polo’s Work, a
    version<span class="sidenote">Eclectic formation of the English Text of this Translation.</span> on which the Geographic Text did not exercise a material influence.
    But to adopt that Text, with all its awkwardnesses and tautologies, as the
    absolute subject of translation, would have been a mistake. What I have
    done has been, in the first instance, to translate from Pauthier’s Text.
    The process of abridgment in this text, however it came about, has been on
    the whole judiciously executed, getting rid of the intolerable prolixities
    of manner which belong to many parts of the Original Dictation, but <em>as a
    general rule</em> preserving the matter. Having translated this,—not always
    from the Text adopted by Pauthier himself, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i142"><i>142</i></span>but with the exercise of my own
    judgment on the various readings which that Editor lays before us,—I then
    compared the translation with the Geographic Text, and transferred from
    the latter not only all items of real substance that had been omitted, but
    also all expressions of special interest and character, and occasionally
    a greater fulness of phraseology where condensation in Pauthier’s text
    seemed to have been carried too far. And finally I introduced <em>between
    brackets</em> everything peculiar to Ramusio’s version that seemed to me to
    have a just claim to be reckoned authentic, and that could be so introduced
    without harshness or mutilation. Many passages from the same source which
    were of interest in themselves, but failed to meet one or other of these
    conditions, have been given in the notes.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

  <p>91. As regards the reading of proper names and foreign words, in which
    there is so much variation in the different MSS. and editions, <span class="sidenote">Mode of rendering proper names.</span>I have done
    my best to select what seemed to be the true reading from the G.&nbsp;T. and
    Pauthier’s three MSS., only in some rare instances transgressing this limit.</p>

  <p>Where the MSS. in the repetition of a name afforded a choice of forms, I
    have selected that which came nearest the real name when known. Thus the
    G.&nbsp;T. affords <em>Baldasciain, Badascian, Badasciam, Badausiam, Balasian</em>. I
    adopt <span class="smcap">Badascian</span>, or in English spelling <span class="smcap">Badashan</span>, because it is closest to
    the real name <em>Badakhshan</em>. Another place appears as <span class="smcap">Cobinan</span>, <em>Cabanat,
    Cobian</em>. I adopt the first because it is the truest expression of the real
    name <em>Koh-benán</em>. In chapters 23, 24 of Book I., we have in the G.&nbsp;T.
    <em>Asisim, Asciscin, Asescin</em>, and in Pauthier’s MSS. <em>Hasisins, Harsisins</em>,
    etc. I adopt <span class="smcap">Asciscin</span>, or in English spelling <span class="smcap">Ashishin</span>, for the same reason
    as before. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_i143"><i>143</i></span>So with <em>Creman, Crerman, Crermain</em>, <span class="smcap">Querman</span>, Anglicè <span class="smcap">Kerman</span>;
    Cormos, <span class="smcap">Hormos</span>, and many more.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

  <p>In two or three cases I have adopted a reading which I cannot show
    <i lang="la">literatim</i> in any authority, but because such a form appears to be the
    just resultant from the variety of readings which are presented; as in
    surveying one takes the mean of a number of observations when no one can
    claim an absolute preference.</p>

  <p>Polo’s proper names, even in the French Texts, are <em>in the main</em> formed
    on an Italian fashion of spelling.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I see no object in preserving such
    spelling in an English book, so after selecting the best reading of the
    name I express it in English spelling, printing <em>Badashan, Pashai, Kerman</em>,
    instead of <em>Badascian, Pasciai, Querman</em>, and so on.</p>

  <p>And when a little trouble has been taken to ascertain the true form and
    force of Polo’s spelling of Oriental names and technical expressions, it
    will be found that they are in the main as accurate as Italian lips and
    orthography will admit, and not justly liable either to those disparaging
    epithets<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or to those exegetical distortions which have been too often
    applied to them. Thus, for example, <em>Cocacin, Ghel</em> or <em>Ghelan, Tonocain,
    Cobinan, Ondanique, Barguerlac, Argon, Sensin, Quescican, Toscaol,
    Bularguci, Zardandan, Anin, Caugigu, Coloman, Gauenispola, Mutfili,
    Avarian, Choiach</em>, are not, it will be seen, the ignorant blunderings which
    the interpretations affixed by some commentators would imply them to be,
    but are, on the contrary, all but perfectly accurate utterances of the
    names and words intended.</p>

  <p>The <em>-tchéou</em> (of French writers), <em>-choo</em>, <em>-chow</em>, or <em>-chau</em><a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
    of English writers, which so frequently forms the terminal part in
    the names of Chinese cities, is almost invariably rendered by Polo as
    <em>-giu</em>. This has frequently in the MSS., and constantly in the printed
    editions, been converted into <em>-gui</em>, and thence into <em>-guy</em>. This is on
    the whole the most constant canon of Polo’s geographical orthography,
    and holds in <em>Caagiu</em> (Ho-chau), <em>Singiu</em> (Sining-chau), <em>Cui-giu</em>
    (Kwei-chau), <em>Sin-giu</em> (T’sining-chau), <em>Pi-giu</em> (Pei-chau), <em>Coigangiu</em>
    (Hwaingan-chau), <em>Si-giu</em> (Si-chau), <em>Ti-giu</em> (Tai-chau), <em>Tin-giu</em>
    (Tung-chau), <em>Yan-giu</em> (Yang-chau), <em>Sin-giu</em> (Chin-chau), <em>Cai-giu</em>
    (Kwa-chau), <em>Chinghi-giu</em> (Chang-chau), <em>Su-giu</em> (Su-chau), <em>Vu-giu</em>
    (Wu-chau), and perhaps a few more. In one or two instances only (as
    <em>Sinda-ciu</em>, <em>Caiciu</em>) he has <em>-ciu</em> instead of <em>-giu</em>.</p>

  <p>The chapter-headings I have generally taken from Pauthier’s Text, but they
    are no essential part of the original work, and they have been slightly
    modified or enlarged where it seemed desirable.</p>

      <a id="Footnote_383" href="#FNanchor_383" class="label">[1]</a> This “eclectic formation of the English text,” as I have
      called it for brevity in the marginal rubric, has been disapproved
      by Mr. de Khanikoff, a critic worthy of high respect. But I must
      repeat that the duties of a translator, and of the Editor of an
      original text, at least where the various recensions bear so
      peculiar a relation to each other as in this case, are essentially
      different; and that, on reconsidering the matter after an interval
      of four or five years, the plan which I have adopted, whatever be
      the faults of execution, still commends itself to me as the only
      appropriate one.

      <p>Let Mr. de Khanikoff consider what course he would adopt if he
        were about to publish Marco Polo in Russian. I feel certain that
        with whatever theory he might set out, before his task should be
        concluded he would have arrived practically at the same system that
        I have adopted.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_384" href="#FNanchor_384" class="label">[2]</a> In Polo’s diction C frequently represents H., <i>e.g.</i>, <em>Cormos</em>
      = Hormuz; <em>Camadi</em> probably = Hamadi; <em>Caagiu</em> probably = Hochau;
      <em>Cacianfu</em> = Hochangfu, and so on. This is perhaps attributable to
      Rusticiano’s Tuscan ear. A true Pisan will absolutely contort his
      features in the intensity of his efforts to aspirate sufficiently
      the letter C. Filippo Villani, speaking of the famous Aguto (Sir
      J. Hawkwood), says his name in English was <em>Kauchouvole</em>. (<cite>Murat.

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_385" href="#FNanchor_385" class="label">[3]</a> In the Venetian dialect <em>ch</em> and <em>j</em> are often sounded as
      in English, not as in Italian. Some traces of such pronunciation
      I think there are, as in <em>Coja, Carajan</em>, and in the Chinese name
      <em>Vanchu</em> (occurring only in Ramusio, <i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_i99">p. <i>99</i></a>). But the scribe
      of the original work being a Tuscan, the spelling is in the main
      Tuscan. The sound of the <em>Qu</em> is, however, French, as in <em>Quescican,
      Quinsai</em>, except perhaps in the case of <em>Quenianfu</em>, for a reason
      given in vol. ii. p. 29.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_386" href="#FNanchor_386" class="label">[4]</a> For example, that enthusiastic student of mediæval
      Geography, Joachim Lelewel, speaks of Polo’s “gibberish” (<i lang="fr">le
      baragouinage du Venitien</i>) with special reference to such names as
      <em>Zayton</em> and <em>Kinsay</em>, whilst we now know that these names were in
      universal use by all foreigners in China, and no more deserve to
      be called gibberish than <em>Bocca-Tigris</em>, <em>Leghorn</em>, <em>Ratisbon</em>, or
      <em>Buda</em>.</div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_387" href="#FNanchor_387" class="label">[5]</a> I am quite sensible of the diffidence with which any
      outsider should touch any question of Chinese language or
      orthography. A Chinese scholar and missionary (Mr. Moule) objects
      to my spelling <em>chau</em>, whilst he, I see, uses <em>chow</em>. I imagine we
      mean the same sound, according to the spelling which I try to use
      throughout the book. Dr. C. Douglas, another missionary scholar,
      writes <em>chau</em>.</div>

    advantages might, by his Book, get such knowledge. And I may tell you that
    in acquiring this knowledge he spent in those various parts of the World
    good six-and-twenty years. Now, being thereafter an inmate of the Prison
    at Genoa, he caused Messer Rusticiano of Pisa, who was in the said Prison
    likewise, to reduce the whole to writing; and this befell in the year 1298
    from the birth of Jesus.</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Two Brothers Polo set forth from Constantinople to traverse the world.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> came to pass in the year of Christ 1260, when Baldwin was reigning at
    Constantinople,<a id="NoteAnchor_Ip1" href="#Note_Ip1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> that Messer Nicolas Polo, the father of my lord
    Mark, and Messer Maffeo Polo, the brother of Messer Nicolas, were at the
    said city of <span class="smcap">Constantinople</span>, whither they had gone from Venice with their
    merchants’ wares. Now these two Brethren, men singularly noble, wise, and
    provident, took counsel together to cross the <span class="smcap">Greater Sea</span> on a venture of
    trade; so they laid in a store of jewels and set forth from Constantinople,
    crossing the Sea to <span class="smcap">Soldaia</span>.<a id="NoteAnchor_Ip2" href="#Note_Ip2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_Ip1" href="#NoteAnchor_Ip1" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Baldwin II. (de Courtenay), the last Latin Emperor of
      Constantinople, reigned from 1237 to 1261, when he was expelled by Michael
      Palaeologus.</p>

    <p>The date in the text is, as we see, that of the Brothers’ voyage across
      the Black Sea. It stands 1250 in all the chief texts. But the figure is
      certainly wrong. We shall see that, when the Brothers return to Venice in
      1269, they find Mark, who, according to Ramusio’s version, was <em>born after
      their departure</em>, a lad of fifteen. Hence, if we rely on Ramusio, they must
      have left Venice about 1253–54. And we shall see also that they reached the
      Volga in 1261. Hence their start from Constantinople may well have occurred
      in 1260, and this I have adopted as the most probable correction. Where
      they spent the interval between 1254 (if they really left Venice so early)
      and 1260, nowhere appears. But as their brother, Mark the Elder, in his
      Will styles himself “<em>whilom of Constantinople</em>,” their headquarters were
      probably there.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_Ip2" href="#NoteAnchor_Ip2" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—In the Middle Ages the Euxine was frequently called <em>Mare Magnum</em>
      or <em>Majus</em>. Thus Chaucer:—</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The term Black Sea (<em>Mare Maurum</em> v. <em>Nigrum</em>) was, however, in use,
      and Abulfeda says it was general in his day. That name has been alleged
      to appear as early as the 10th century, in the form <span lang="el">Σκοτεινή</span>,
      “The Dark Sea”; but an examination of the passage cited, from Constantine
      Porphyrogenitus, shows that it refers rather to the Baltic, whilst that
      author elsewhere calls the Euxine simply Pontus. (<cite>Reinaud’s Abulf.</cite> I. 38,
      <cite>Const. Porph. De Adm. Imp.</cite> c. 31, c. 42.)</p>

    <p>✛ <em>Sodaya, Soldaia</em>, or <em>Soldachia</em>, called by Orientals <em>Súdák</em>, stands on
      the S.E. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>coast of the Crimea, west of Kaffa. It had belonged to the Greek
      Empire, and had a considerable Greek population. After the Frank conquest
      of 1204 it apparently fell to Trebizond. It was taken by the Mongols in
      1223 for the first time, and a second time in 1239, and during that century
      was the great port of intercourse with what is now Russia. At an uncertain
      date, but about the middle of the century, the Venetians established a
      factory there, which in 1287 became the seat of a consul. In 1323 we find
      Pope John XXII. complaining to Uzbek Khan of Sarai that the Christians
      had been ejected from Soldaia and their churches turned into mosques.
      Ibn Batuta, who alludes to this strife, counts Sudak as one of the four
      great ports of the World. The Genoese got Soldaia in 1365 and built strong
      defences, still to be seen. Kaffa, with a good anchorage, in the 14th
      century, and later on Tana, took the place of Soldaia as chief emporium in
      South Russia. Some of the Arab Geographers call the Sea of Azov the Sea of
      Sudak.</p>

    <p>The Elder Marco Polo in his Will (1280) bequeaths to the Franciscan
      Friars of the place a house of his in <em>Soldachia</em>, reserving life
      occupation to his own son and daughter, then residing in it. Probably this
      establishment already existed when the two Brothers went thither. (<em>Elie de
      Laprimaudaie</em>, passim; <em>Gold. Horde</em>, 87; <cite>Mosheim</cite>, App. 148; <cite>Ibn Bat.</cite>

  <div class="subh4">How the Two Brothers went on beyond Soldaia.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> stayed a while at Soldaia, they considered the matter, and thought
    it well to extend their journey further. So they set forth from Soldaia and
    travelled till they came to the Court of a certain Tartar Prince, <span class="smcap">Barca
    Kaan</span> by name, whose residences were at <span class="smcap">Sara</span><a id="NoteAnchor_IIp1" href="#Note_IIp1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> and at <span class="smcap">Bolgara</span> [and
    who was esteemed one of the most liberal and courteous Princes that ever
    was among the Tartars.]<a id="NoteAnchor_IIp2" href="#Note_IIp2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> This Barca was delighted at the arrival of
    the Two Brothers, and treated them with great honour; so they presented to
    him the whole of the jewels that they had brought with them. The Prince
    was highly pleased with these, and accepted the offering most graciously,
    causing the Brothers to receive at least twice its value.</p>

  <p>After they had spent a twelvemonth at the court of this Prince there broke
    out a great war between Barca <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>and Aláu, the Lord of the Tartars of the
    Levant, and great hosts were mustered on either side.<a id="NoteAnchor_IIp3" href="#Note_IIp3" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>But in the end Barca, the Lord of the Tartars of the Ponent, was defeated,
    though on both sides there was great slaughter. And by reason of this war
    no one could travel without peril of being taken; thus it was at least on
    the road by which the Brothers had come, though there was no obstacle to
    their travelling forward. So the Brothers, finding they could not retrace
    their steps, determined to go forward. Quitting Bolgara, therefore, they
    proceeded to a city called <span class="smcap">Ucaca</span>, which was at the extremity of the kingdom
    of the Lord of the Ponent;<a id="NoteAnchor_IIp4" href="#Note_IIp4" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> and thence departing again, and passing
    the great River Tigris, they travelled across a Desert which extended for
    seventeen days’ journey, and wherein they found neither town nor village,
    falling in only with the tents of Tartars occupied with their cattle at
    pasture.<a id="NoteAnchor_IIp5" href="#Note_IIp5" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_IIp1" href="#NoteAnchor_IIp1" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—✛ Barka Khan, third son of Jújí, the first-born of Chinghiz,
      ruled the <em>Ulús</em> of Juji and Empire of Kipchak (Southern Russia) from
      1257 to 1265. He was the first Musulman sovereign of his race. His chief
      residence was at <span class="smcap">Sarai</span> (Sara of the text), a city founded by his brother
      and predecessor Bátú, on the banks of the Akhtuba branch of the Volga. In
      the next century Ibn Batuta describes Sarai as a very handsome and populous
      city, so large that it made half a day’s journey to ride through it. The
      inhabitants were Mongols, Aás (or Alans), Kipchaks, Circassians, Russians,
      and Greeks, besides the foreign Moslem merchants, who had a walled quarter.
      Another Mahomedan traveller of the same century says the city itself was
      not walled, but, “The Khan’s Palace was a great edifice surmounted by a
      golden crescent weighing two <em>kantars</em> of Egypt, and encompassed by a wall
      flanked with towers,” etc. Pope John XXII., on the 26th February 1322,
      defined the limits of the new Bishopric of Kaffa, which were Sarai to the
      east and Varna to the west.</p>

    <p>Sarai became the seat of both a Latin and a Russian metropolitan, and of
      more than one Franciscan convent. It was destroyed by Timur on his second
      invasion of Kipchak (1395–6), and extinguished by the Russians a century
      later. It is the scene of Chaucer’s half-told tale of Cambuscan:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“At <em>Sarra</em>, in the Londe of Tartarie,</div>
          <div class="i1">There dwelt a King that werriëd Russie.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>[“<cite>Mesalek-al-absar</cite> (285, 287), says Sarai, meaning ‘the Palace,’ was
      founded by Bereké, brother of Batu. It stood in a salty plain, and was
      without walls, though the palace had walls flanked by towers. The town
      was large, had markets, <em>madrasas</em>—and baths. It is usually identified
      with Selitrennoyé Gorodok, about 70 miles above Astrakhan.” (<cite>Rockhill,
      Rubruck</cite>, p. 260, note.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Several sites exhibiting extensive ruins near the banks of the Akhtuba have
      been identified with Sarai; two in particular. One of these is not far from
      the great <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>elbow of the Volga at Tzaritzyn: the other much lower down, at
      Selitrennoyé Gorodok or Saltpetre-Town, not far above Astrakhan.</p>

    <p>The upper site exhibits by far the most extensive traces of former
      population, and is declared unhesitatingly to be the sole site of Sarai
      by M. Gregorieff, who carried on excavations among the remains for four
      years, though with what precise results I have not been able to learn.
      The most dense part of the remains, consisting of mounds and earth-works,
      traces of walls, buildings, cisterns, dams, and innumerable canals, extends
      for about 7½ miles in the vicinity of the town of Tzarev, but a tract of
      66 miles in length and 300 miles in circuit, commencing from near the
      head of the Akhtuba, presents remains of like character, though of less
      density, marking the ground occupied by the villages which encircled the
      capital. About 2½ miles to the N.W. of Tzarev a vast mass of such remains,
      surrounded by the traces of a brick rampart, points out the presumable
      position of the Imperial Palace.</p>

    <p>M. Gregorieff appears to admit no alternative. Yet it seems certain that
      the indications of Abulfeda, Pegolotti, and others, with regard to the
      position of the capital in the early part of the 14th century, are not
      consistent with a site so far from the Caspian. Moreover, F. H. Müller
      states that the site near Tzarev is known to the Tartars as the “Sarai of
      Janibek Khan” (1341–1357). Now it is worthy of note that in the coinage
      of Janibek we repeatedly find as the place of mintage, <em>New Sarai</em>.
      Arabsháh in his History of Timur states that 63 years had elapsed from the
      foundation to the destruction of Sarai. But it must have been at least 140
      years since the foundation of Batu’s city. Is it not possible, therefore,
      that both the sites which we have mentioned were successively occupied by
      the Mongol capital; that the original Sarai of Batu was at Selitrennoyé
      Gorodok, and that the <em>New Sarai</em> of Janibek was established by him, or
      by his father Uzbeg in his latter days, on the upper Akhtuba? Pegolotti
      having carried his merchant from Tana (Azov) to Gittarchan (Astrakhan),
      takes him <em>one day</em> by river to Sara, and from Sara to <em>Saracanco</em>, also by
      river, eight days more. (<em>Cathay</em>, p. 287.) In the work quoted I have taken
      Saracanco for Saraichik, on the Yaik. But it was possibly the Upper or New
      Sarai on the Akhtuba. Ibn Batuta, marching on the frozen river, reached
      Sarai in three days from Astrakhan. This could not have been at Tzarev, 200
      miles off.</p>

    <p>In corroboration (<i lang="la">quantum valeat</i>) of my suggestion that there must have
      been two Sarais near the Volga, Professor Bruun of Odessa points to the
      fact that Fra Mauro’s map presents <em>two</em> cities of Sarai on the Akhtuba;
      only the Sarai of Janibeg is with him no longer <em>New</em> Sarai, but <em>Great</em>
      Sarai.</p>

    <p>The use of the latter name suggests the possibility that in the <em>Saracanco</em>
      of Pegolotti the latter half of the name may be the Mongol <em>Kúnḳ</em> “Great.”
      (See <cite>Pavet de Courteille</cite>, p. 439.)</p>

    <p>Professor Bruun also draws attention to the impossibility of Ibn Batuta’s
      travelling from Astrakhan to Tzarev in three days, an argument which had
      already occurred to me and been inserted above.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_IIp2" href="#NoteAnchor_IIp2" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—<span class="smcap">Bolghar</span>, our author’s Bolgara, was the capital of the region
      sometimes called Great Bulgaria, by Abulfeda <em>Inner Bulgaria</em>, and stood
      a few miles from the left bank of the Volga, in latitude about 54° 54′,
      and 90 miles below Kazan. The old Arab writers regarded it as nearly the
      limit of the habitable world, and told wonders of the cold, the brief
      summer nights, and the fossil ivory that was found in its vicinity. This
      was exported, and with peltry, wax, honey, hazel-nuts, and Russia leather,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>formed the staple articles of trade. The last item derived from Bolghar
      the name which it still bears all over Asia. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XVI2">Bk. II. ch. xvi.</a>, and
      Note.) Bolghar seems to have been the northern limit of Arab travel, and
      was visited by the curious (by Ibn Batuta among others) in order to witness
      the phenomena of the short summer night, as tourists now visit Hammerfest
      to witness its entire absence.</p>

    <p>Russian chroniclers speak of an earlier capital of the Bulgarian kingdom,
      Brakhimof, near the mouth of the Kama, destroyed by Andrew, Grand Duke of
      Rostof and Susdal, about 1160; and this may have been the city referred
      to in the earlier Arabic accounts. The fullest of these is by Ibn Fozlán,
      who accompanied an embassy from the Court of Baghdad to Bolghar, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
      921. The King and people had about this time been converted to Islam,
      having previously, as it would seem, professed Christianity. Nevertheless,
      a Mahomedan writer of the 14th century says the people had then long
      renounced Islam for the worship of the Cross. (<cite>Not. et Extr.</cite> XIII. i. 270.)</p>

      <img class="w100" src="images/i007.jpg" alt="" />
      <div class="caption">Ruins of Bolghar.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Bolghar was first captured by the Mongols in 1225. It seems to have
      perished early in the 15th century, after which Kazan practically took its
      place. Its position is still marked by a village called Bolgari, where
      ruins of Mahomedan character remain, and where coins and inscriptions have
      been found. Coins of the Kings of Bolghar, struck in the 10th century, have
      been described by Fraehn, as well as coins of the Mongol period struck at
      Bolghar. Its latest known coin is of <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span> 818 (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1415–16). A history
      of Bolghar was written in the first half of the 12th century by Yakub Ibn
      Noman, Kadhi of the city, but this is not known to be extant.</p>

    <p>Fraehn shows ground for believing the people to have been a mixture of
      Fins, Slavs, and Turks. Nicephorus Gregoras supposes that they took their
      name from the great river on which they dwelt (<span lang="el">Βούλγα</span>).</p>

    <p>[“The ruins [of Bolghar],” says Bretschneider, in his <cite>Mediæval
      Researches</cite>, published in 1888, vol. ii. p. 82, “still exist, and have been
      the subject of learned investigation by several Russian scholars. These
      remains are found on the spot where now the village <em>Uspenskoye</em>, called
      also <em>Bolgarskoye</em> (Bolgari), stands, in the district of Spask, province
      of Kazan. This village is about 4 English miles distant from the Volga,
      east of it, and 83 miles from Kazan.” Part of the Bulgars removed to the
      Balkans; others remained in their native country on the shores of the
      Azov Sea, and were subjugated by the Khazars. At the beginning of the 9th
      century, they marched northwards to the Volga and the Kama, and established
      the kingdom of Great Bulgaria. Their chief city, Bolghar, was on the
      bank of the Volga, but the river runs now to the west; as the Kama also
      underwent a change in its course, it is possible that formerly Bolghar was
      built at the junction of the two rivers. (Cf. <cite>Reclus, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>Europe russe</cite>, p.
      761.) The Bulgars were converted to Islam in 922. Their country was first
      invaded by the Mongols under Subutai in 1223; this General conquered it in
      1236, the capital was destroyed the following year, and the country annexed
      to the kingdom of Kipchak. Bolghar was again destroyed in 1391 by Tamerlan.
      In 1438, Ulugh Mohammed, cousin of Toka Timur, younger son of Juji,
      transformed this country into the khanate of Kazan, which survived till
      1552. It had probably been the capital of the Golden Horde before Sarai.</p>

    <p>With reference to the early Christianity of the Bulgarians, to which Yule
      refers in his note, the <cite>Laurentian Chronicle</cite> (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1229), quoted by
      Shpilevsky, adduces evidence to show that in the Great City, <i>i.e.</i> <em>Bulgar</em>,
      there were Russian Christians and a Christian cemetery, and the death of
      a Bulgarian Christian martyr is related in the same chronicle as well as
      in the Nikon, Tver, and Tatischef annals in which his name is given. (Cf.
      Shpilevsky, <cite>Anc. towns and other Bulgaro-Tartar monuments</cite>, Kazan, 1877,
      p. 158 seq.; <cite>Rockhill’s Rubruck</cite>, Hakl. Soc. p. 121, note.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The severe and lasting winter is spoken of by Ibn Fozlán and other old
      writers in terms that seem to point to a modern mitigation of climate.
      It is remarkable, too, that Ibn Fozlán speaks of the aurora as of very
      frequent occurrence, which is not now the case in that latitude. We may
      suspect this frequency to have been connected with the greater cold
      indicated, and perhaps with a different position of the magnetic pole. Ibn
      Fozlán’s account of the aurora is very striking:—“Shortly before sunset the
      horizon became all very ruddy, and at the same time I heard sounds in the
      upper air, with a dull rustling. I looked up and beheld sweeping over me a
      fire-red cloud, from which these sounds issued, and in it movements, as it
      were, of men and horses; the men grasping bows, lances, and swords. This I
      saw, or thought I saw. Then there appeared a white cloud of like aspect;
      in it also I beheld armed horsemen, and these rushed against the former as
      one squadron of horse charges another. We were so terrified at this that
      we turned with humble prayer to the Almighty, whereupon the natives about
      us wondered and broke into loud laughter. We, however, continued to gaze,
      seeing how one cloud charged the other, remained confused with it a while,
      and then sundered again. These movements lasted deep into the night, and
      then all vanished.”</p>

      3.</a>—<span class="smcap">Alau</span> is Polo’s representation of the name of Hulákú, brother of the
      Great Kaans Mangu and Kublai and founder of the Mongol dynasty in Persia.
      In the Mongol pronunciation guttural and palatal consonants are apt to be
      elided, hence this spelling. The same name is written by Pope Alexander
      IV., in addressing the Khan, <em>Olao</em>, by Pachymeres and Gregoras <span lang="el">Χαλαὺ</span>
      and <span lang="el">Χαλαοῦ</span>, by Hayton <em>Haolon</em>, by Ibn Batuta <em>Huláún</em>,
      as well as in a letter of Hulaku’s own, as given by Makrizi.</p>

    <p>The war in question is related in Rashíduddín’s history, and by Polo
      himself towards the end of the work. It began in the summer of 1262, and
      ended about eight months later. Hence the Polos must have reached Barka’s
      Court in 1261.</p>

    <p>Marco always applies to the Mongol Khans of Persia the title of “Lords of
      the East” (<em>Levant</em>), and to the Khans of Kipchak that of “Lords of the
      West” (<em>Ponent</em>). We use the term <em>Levant</em> still with a similar specific
      application, and in another form <em>Anatolia</em>. I think it best to preserve
      the terms <em>Levant</em> and <em>Ponent</em> when used in this way.</p>

      of the great and mightie kingdome of China</cite> ... London, printed by I. Wolfe

    <p><a id="Note_IIp4" href="#NoteAnchor_IIp4" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—<span class="smcap">Ucaca</span> or <span class="smcap">Ukek</span> was a town on the right bank of the Volga, nearly
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>equidistant between Sarai and Bolghar, and about six miles south of the
      modern Saratov, where a village called <em>Uwek</em> still exists. Ukek is not
      mentioned before the Mongol domination, and is supposed to have been of
      Mongol foundation, as the name Ukek is said in Mongol to signify a dam of
      hurdles. The city is mentioned by Abulfeda as marking the extremity of
      “the empire of the Barka Tartars,” and Ibn Batuta speaks of it as “one
      day distant from the hills of the Russians.” Polo therefore means that
      it was the frontier of the Ponent towards Russia. Ukek was the site of a
      Franciscan convent in the 14th century; it is mentioned several times in
      the campaigns of Timur, and was destroyed by his army. It is not mentioned
      under the form Ukek after this, but appears as <em>Uwek</em> and <em>Uwesh</em> in
      Russian documents of the 16th century. Perhaps this was always the Slavonic
      form, for it already is written <em>Uguech</em> (= Uwek) in Wadding’s 14th century
      catalogue of convents. Anthony Jenkinson, in Hakluyt, gives an observation
      of its latitude, as <em>Oweke</em> (51° 40′), and Christopher Burrough, in the
      same collection, gives a description of it as <em>Oueak</em>, and the latitude as
      51° 30′ (some 7′ too much). In his time (1579) there were the remains of a
      “very faire stone castle” and city, with old tombs exhibiting sculptures
      and inscriptions. All these have long vanished. Burrough was told by the
      Russians that the town “was swallowed into the earth by the justice of
      God, for the wickednesse of the people that inhabited the same.” Lepechin
      in 1769 found nothing remaining but part of an earthen rampart and some
      underground vaults of larger bricks, which the people dug out for use. He
      speaks of coins and other relics as frequent, and the like have been found
      more recently. Coins with Mongol-Arab inscriptions, struck at Ukek by
      Tuktugai Khan in 1306, have been described by Fraehn and Erdmann.</p>

      Tigris was a reappearance of the same river. The ecclesiastical historian,
      Nicephorus Callistus, appears to imply that the Tigris coming from Paradise
      flows under the Caspian to emerge in Kurdistan. (See IX. 19.)</p>

    <p>The “17 days” applies to one stretch of desert. The whole journey from Ukek
      Bokhara would take some 60 days at least. Ibn Batuta is 58 days from Sarai
      to Bokhara, and of the last section he says, “we entered the desert which
      extends between Khwarizm and Bokhara, and <em>which has an extent of 18 days’

      (<em>Apostolicus</em>), the usual French expression of that age.</p>

    <p>It is remarkable that for the most part the text edited by Pauthier has the
      correcter Oriental form <em>Tatar</em>, instead of the usual <em>Tartar</em>. <em>Tattar</em> is
      the word used by Yvo of Narbonne, in the curious letter given by Matthew
      Paris under 1243.</p>

    <p>We are often told that <em>Tartar</em> is a vulgar European error. It is in any
      case a very old one; nor does it seem to be of European origin, but rather
      Armenian;<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> though the suggestion of Tartarus may have given it readier
      currency in Europe. Russian writers, or rather writers who have been in
      Russia, sometimes try to force on us a specific limitation of the word
      <em>Tartar</em> to a certain class of Oriental Turkish race, to whom the Russians
      appropriate the name. But there is no just ground for this. <em>Tátár</em> is
      used by Oriental writers of Polo’s age exactly as Tartar was then, and is
      still, used in Western Europe, as a generic title for the Turanian hosts
      who followed Chinghiz and his successors. But I believe the name in this
      sense was unknown to Western Asia before the time of Chinghiz. And General
      Cunningham must overlook this when he connects the <em>Ṭáṭaríya</em> coins,
      mentioned by Arab geographers of the 9th century, with “the Scythic or
      Tátár princes who ruled in Kabul” in the beginning of our era. Tartars on
      the Indian frontier in those centuries are surely to be classed with the
      Frenchmen whom Brennus led to Rome, or the Scotchmen who fought against
      Agricola.</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Great Kaan sent the Two Brothers as his Envoys to the Pope.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> that Prince, whose name was <span class="smcap">Cublay Kaan</span>, Lord of the Tartars all over
    the earth, and of all the kingdoms and provinces and territories of that
    vast quarter of the world, had heard all that the Brothers had to tell him
    about the ways of the Latins, he was greatly pleased, and he took it into
    his head that he would send them on an Embassy to the Pope. So he urgently
    desired them to undertake this mission along with one of his Barons; and
    they replied that they would gladly execute all his commands as those of
    their Sovereign Lord. Then the Prince sent to summon to his presence one
    of his Barons whose name was <span class="smcap">Cogatal</span>, and desired him to get ready, for
    it was proposed to send him to the Pope along with the Two Brothers. The
    Baron replied that he would execute the Lord’s commands to the best of his ability.</p>

  <p>After this the Prince caused letters from himself to the Pope to be indited
    in the Tartar tongue,<a id="NoteAnchor_VIIp1" href="#Note_VIIp1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> and committed them to the Two Brothers and to
    that Baron of his own, and charged them with what he wished them to say to
    the Pope. Now the contents of the letter were to this purport: He begged
    that the Pope would send as many as an hundred persons of our Christian
    faith; intelligent men, acquainted with the Seven Arts,<a id="NoteAnchor_VIIp2" href="#Note_VIIp2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> well
    qualified to enter into controversy, and able clearly to prove by force
    of argument to idolaters and other kinds of folk, that the Law of Christ
    was best, and that all other religions were false and naught; and that if
    they would prove this, he and all under him would become Christians and the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>Church’s liegemen. Finally he charged his Envoys to bring back to him some
    Oil of the Lamp which burns on the Sepulchre of our Lord at Jerusalem.<a id="NoteAnchor_VIIp3" href="#Note_VIIp3" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_VIIp1" href="#NoteAnchor_VIIp1" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—✛ The appearance of the Great Kaan’s letter may be illustrated by
      two letters on so-called Corean paper preserved in the French archives;
      one from Arghún Khan of Persia (1289), brought by Buscarel, and the other
      from his son Oljaitu (May, 1305), to Philip the Fair. These are both in
      the Mongol language, and according to Abel Rémusat and other authorities,
      in the Uighúr character, the parent of the present Mongol writing.
      Facsimiles of the letters are given in Rémusat’s paper on intercourse with
      Mongol Princes, in <cite>Mém. de l’Acad. des Inscript.</cite> vols. vii. and viii.,

    <p><a id="Note_VIIp2" href="#NoteAnchor_VIIp2" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—“The Seven Arts,” from a date reaching back nearly to classical
      times, and down through the Middle Ages, expressed the whole circle of
      a liberal education, and it is to these Seven Arts that the degrees in
      arts were understood to apply. They were divided into the <em>Trivium</em>
      of Rhetoric, Logic, and Grammar, and the <em>Quadrivium</em> of Arithmetic,
      Astronomy, Music, and Geometry. The 38th epistle of Seneca was in many
      MSS. (according to Lipsius) entitled “<cite>L. Annaei Senecae Liber de Septem
      Artibus liberalibus.</cite>” I do not find, however, that Seneca there mentions
      categorically more than five, viz., Grammar, Geometry, Music, Astronomy,
      and Arithmetic. In the 5th century we find the Seven Arts to form the
      successive subjects of the last seven books of the work of Martianus
      Capella, much used in the schools during the early Middle Ages. The Seven
      Arts will be found enumerated in the verses of Tzetzes (<cite>Chil. XI.</cite> 525),
      and allusions to them in the mediæval romances are endless. Thus, in
      one of the “Gestes d’Alexandre,” a chapter is headed “<cite>Comment Aristotle
      aprent à Alixandre les Sept Arts.</cite>” In the tale of the Seven Wise Masters,
      Diocletian selects that number of tutors for his son, each to instruct him
      in one of the Seven Arts. In the romance of <cite>Erec and Eneide</cite> we have a
      dress on which the fairies had portrayed the Seven Arts (<cite>Franc. Michel,
      Recherches</cite>, etc. II. 82); in the <cite>Roman de Mahommet</cite> the young impostor is
      master of all the seven. There is one mediæval poem called the <cite>Marriage
      of the Seven Arts</cite>, and another called the <cite>Battle of the Seven Arts</cite>. (See
      also Dante, <cite>Convito</cite>, Trat. II. c. 14; <cite>Not. et Ex.</cite> V., 491 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_VIIp3" href="#NoteAnchor_VIIp3" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The Chinghizide
      Princes were eminently liberal—or indifferent—in
      religion; and even after they became Mahomedan, which, however, the Eastern
      branch never did, they were rarely and only by brief fits persecutors.
      Hence there was scarcely one of the non-Mahomedan Khans of whose conversion
      to Christianity there were not stories spread. The first rumours of
      Chinghiz in the West were as of a Christian conqueror; tales may be found
      of the Christianity of Chagatai, Hulaku, Abaka, Arghun, Baidu, Ghazan,
      Sartak, Kuyuk, Mangu, Kublai, and one or two of the latter’s successors in
      China, all probably false, with one or two doubtful exceptions.</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Great Kaan gave them a Tablet of Gold, bearing his orders in their
    behalf.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Prince had charged them with all his commission, he caused to
    be given them a Tablet of Gold, on which was inscribed that the three
    Ambassadors should be supplied with everything needful in all the countries
    through which they should pass—with horses, with escorts, and, in short,
    with whatever they should require. And when they had made all needful
    preparations, the three Ambassadors took their leave of the Emperor and set out.</p>

  <p>When they had travelled I know not how many days, the Tartar Baron fell
    sick, so that he could not ride, and being very ill, and unable to
    proceed further, he halted at a certain city. So the Two Brothers judged
    it best that they should leave him behind and proceed to carry out their
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>commission; and, as he was well content that they should do so, they
    continued their journey. And I can assure you, that whithersoever they went
    they were honourably provided with whatever they stood in need of, or chose
    to command. And this was owing to that Tablet of Authority from the Lord
    which they carried with them.<a id="NoteAnchor_VIIIp1" href="#Note_VIIIp1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>So they travelled on and on until they arrived at Layas in Hermenia, a
    journey which occupied them, I assure you, for three years.<a id="NoteAnchor_VIIIp2" href="#Note_VIIIp2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> It took
    them so long because they could not always proceed, being stopped sometimes
    by snow, or by heavy rains falling, or by great torrents which they found
    in an impassable state.</p>

      century a place of trade with the West, and the seat of a bishopric, as we
      learn from the romantic but incomplete <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>story of Mary, the noble slave-girl,
      told by Gibbon (ch. 33). As Ayas it became in the latter part of the 13th

      through Tabriz, and was much frequented by the vessels of the Italian

  <div class="subh4">How the Two Brothers came to the city of Acre.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">They</span> departed from Layas and came to <span class="smcap">Acre</span>, arriving there in the month of
    April, in the year of Christ 1269, and then they learned that the Pope
    was dead. And when they found that the Pope was dead (his name was Pope * *),<a id="NoteAnchor_IXp1"
    href="#Note_IXp1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> they went to a certain wise Churchman who was Legate for the
    whole kingdom of Egypt, and a man of great authority, by name <span class="smcap">Theobald of
    Piacenza</span>, and told him of the mission on which they were come. When the
    Legate heard their story, he was greatly surprised, and deemed the thing
    to be of great honour and advantage for the whole of Christendom. So his
    answer to the two Ambassador Brothers was this: “Gentlemen, ye see that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>the
    Pope is dead; wherefore ye must needs have patience until a new Pope be
    made, and then shall ye be able to execute your charge.” Seeing well enough
    that what the Legate said was just, they observed: “But while the Pope is
    a-making, we may as well go to Venice and visit our households.” So they
    departed from Acre and went to Negropont, and from Negropont they continued
    their voyage to Venice.<a id="NoteAnchor_IXp2" href="#Note_IXp2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> On their arrival there, Messer Nicolas

      Pauthier’s, clearly because neither Rusticiano nor Polo remembered it. It
      is supplied correctly in the Crusca Italian as <em>Clement</em>, and in Ramusio as
      <em>Clement IV.</em></p>

    <p>It is not clear that <em>Theobald</em>, though generally adopted, is the
      ecclesiastic’s proper name. It appears in different MSS. as <em>Teald</em> (G.
      T.), <em>Ceabo</em> for <em>Teabo</em> (Pauthier), <em>Odoaldo</em> (Crusca), and in the
      Riccardian as <em>Thebaldus de Vice-comitibus de Placentia</em>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>which corresponds
      to Ramusio’s version. Most of the ecclesiastical chroniclers call him
      <em>Tedaldus</em>, some <em>Thealdus</em>. <em>Tedaldo</em> is a real name, occurring in
      Boccaccio. (Day iii. Novel 7.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_IXp2" href="#NoteAnchor_IXp2" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—After the expulsion of the Venetians from Constantinople, Negropont
      was the centre of their influence in Romania. On the final return of the
      travellers they again take Negropont on their way. [It was one of the ports

    <p><a id="Note_IXp3" href="#NoteAnchor_IXp3" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The <em>edition</em> of the Soc. de Géographie makes Mark’s age <em>twelve</em>,
      but I have verified from inspection the fact noticed by Pauthier that the
      <em>manuscript</em> has distinctly xv. like all the other old texts. In Ramusio
      it is <em>nineteen</em>, but this is doubtless an arbitrary correction to suit
      the mistaken date (1250) assigned for the departure of the father from
      Constantinople.</p>

    <p>There is nothing in the old French texts to justify the usual statement
      that Marco was born after the departure of his father from Venice. All that
      the G.&nbsp;T. says is: “Meser Nicolau treuve que sa fame estoit morte, et les
      remès un filz de xv. anz que avoit à nom Marc,” and Pauthier’s text is to
      the same effect. Ramusio, indeed, has: “M. Nicolò trovò, che sua moglie era
      morta, la quale nella sua partita haveva partorito un figliuolo,” and the
      other versions that are based on Pipino’s seem all to have like statements.</p>

    them, and went straight back to Acre, where they found the Legate of whom
    we have spoken. They had a good deal of discourse with him concerning the
    matter, and asked his permission to go to <span class="smcap">Jerusalem</span> to get some Oil from

    desire to return to the Great Kaan; for we have already tarried long, and
    there has been more than enough delay.” To which the Legate replied: “Since

    <p><a id="Note_XIp1" href="#NoteAnchor_XIp1" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The death of Pope Clement IV. occurred on St Andrew’s Day (29th
      November), 1268; the election of Tedaldo or Tebaldo of Piacenza, a member
      of the Visconti family, and Archdeacon of Liège, did not take place till
      1st September, 1271, owing to the factions among the cardinals. And it is
      said that some of them, anxious only to get away, voted for Theobald in
      full belief that he was dead. The conclave, in its inability to agree,
      had named a committee of six with full powers which the same day elected
      Theobald, on the recommendation of the Cardinal Bishop of Portus (John
      de Toleto, said, in spite of his name, to have been an Englishman). This
      facetious dignitary had suggested that the roof should be taken off the
      Palace at Viterbo where they sat, to allow the divine influences to
      descend more freely on their counsels (<i lang="la">quia nequeunt ad nos per tot
      tecta ingredi</i>). According to some, these doggerel verses, current on the
      occasion, were extemporised by Cardinal John in the pious exuberance of his
      glee:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The Archdeacon, a man of great weight of character, in consequence of
      differences with his Bishop (of Liège), who was a disorderly liver, had
      gone to the Holy Land, and during his stay there he contracted great
      intimacy with Prince Edward of England (Edward I.). Some authors, <i>e.g.</i> John
      Villani (VIII. 39), say that he was Legate in Syria; others, as Rainaldus,
      deny this; but Polo’s statement, and the authority which the Archdeacon
      took on himself in writing to the Kaan, seem to show that he had some such
      position.</p>

    <p>He took the name of Gregory X., and before his departure from Acre,
      preached a moving sermon on the text, “<em>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem</em>,”
      etc. Prince Edward fitted him out for his voyage.</p>

    <p>Gregory reigned barely four years, dying at Arezzo 10th January, 1276. His
      character stood high to the last, and some of the Northern Martyrologies
      enrolled him among the saints, but there has never been canonisation
      by Rome. The people of Arezzo used to celebrate his anniversary with
      torch-light gatherings at his tomb, and plenty of miracles were alleged
      to have occurred there. The tomb still stands in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>Duomo at Arezzo, a

  <div class="subh4">How the Two Brothers presented themselves before the new Pope.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> when they had been thus honourably conducted to Acre they proceeded
    to the presence of the Pope, and paid their respects to him with humble
    reverence. He received them with great honour and satisfaction, and gave
    them his blessing. He then appointed two Friars of the Order of Preachers
    to accompany them to the Great Kaan, and to do whatever might be required
    of them. These were unquestionably as learned Churchmen as were to be found
    in the Province at that day—one being called Friar Nicolas of Vicenza,
    and the other Friar William of Tripoli.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIIp1" href="#Note_XIIp1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> He delivered to them also
    proper credentials, and letters in reply to the Great Kaan’s messages [and
    gave them authority to ordain priests and bishops, and to bestow every kind
    of absolution, as if given by himself in proper person; sending by them
    also many fine vessels of crystal as presents to the Great Kaan].<a id="NoteAnchor_XIIp2" href="#Note_XIIp2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    So when they had got all that was needful, they took leave of the Pope,
    receiving his benediction; and the four set out together from Acre, and
    went to Layas, accompanied always by Messer Nicolas’s son Marco.</p>

  <p>Now, about the time that they reached Layas, Bendocquedar, the Soldan
    of Babylon, invaded Hermenia with a great host of Saracens, and ravaged
    the country, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>so that our Envoys ran a great peril of being taken or
    slain.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIIp3" href="#Note_XIIp3" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> And when the Preaching Friars saw this they were greatly
    frightened, and said that go they never would. So they made over to Messer
    Nicolas and Messer Maffeo all their credentials and documents, and took
    their leave, departing in company with the Master of the Temple.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIIp4" href="#Note_XIIp4" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIIp1" href="#NoteAnchor_XIIp1" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Friar William, of Tripoli, of the Dominican convent at Acre,
      appears to have served there as early as 1250. [He was born <i>circa</i> 1220,
      at Tripoli, in Syria, whence his name.—H.&nbsp;C.] He is known as the author
      of a book, <cite>De Statu Saracenorum post Ludovici Regis de Syriâ reditum</cite>,
      dedicated to Theoldus, Archdeacon of Liège (<i>i.e.</i> Pope Gregory). Of this
      some extracts are printed in Duchesne’s <cite>Hist. Francorum Scriptores</cite>. There
      are two MSS. of it, with different titles, in the Paris Library, and a
      French version in that of Berne. A MS. in Cambridge Univ. Library, which
      contains among other things a copy of Pipino’s Polo, has also the work of
      Friar William:—“<cite>Willelmus Tripolitanus, Aconensis Conventus, de Egressu
      Machometi et Saracenorum, atque progressu eorumdem, de Statu Saracenorum</cite>,”
      etc. It is imperfect; it is addressed <span class="smcap">Theobaldo</span> <i>Ecclesiarcho digno Sancte
      Terre Peregrino Sancto</i>. And from a cursory inspection I imagine that the
      Tract appended to one of the Polo MSS. in the British Museum (Addl. MSS.,
      No. 19,952) is the same work or part of it. To the same author is ascribed
      a tract called <cite>Clades Damiatae</cite>. (<cite>Duchesne</cite>, V. 432; <cite>D’Avezac</cite> in <cite>Rec.
      de Voyages</cite>, IV. 406; <cite>Quétif, Script. Ord. Praed.</cite> I. 264–5; <cite>Catal. of

    <p><a id="Note_XIIp2" href="#NoteAnchor_XIIp2" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—I presume that the powers, stated in this passage from Ramusio to
      have been conferred on the Friars, are exaggerated. In letters of authority
      granted in like cases by Pope Gregory’s successors, Nicolas III. (in 1278)
      and Boniface VIII. (in 1299), the missionary friars to remote regions are
      empowered to absolve from excommunication and release from vows, to settle
      matrimonial questions, to found churches and appoint <i lang="la">idoneos rectores</i>,
      to authorise Oriental clergy who should publicly submit to the Apostolic
      See to enjoy the <i lang="la">privilegium clericale</i>, whilst in the absence of bishops
      those among the missionaries who were priests might consecrate cemeteries,
      altars, palls, etc., admit to the Order of Acolytes, but nothing beyond.
      (See <cite>Mosheim, Hist. Tartar. Eccles.</cite> App. Nos. 23 and 42.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIIp3" href="#NoteAnchor_XIIp3" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The statement here about Bundúḳdár’s invasion of Cilician Armenia
      is a difficulty. He had invaded it in 1266, and his second devastating
      invasion, during which he burnt both Layas and Sis, the king’s residence,
      took place in 1275, a point on which Marino Sanuto is at one with the
      Oriental Historians. Now we know from Rainaldus that Pope Gregory left
      Acre in November or December, 1271, and the text appears to imply that our
      travellers left Acre before him. The utmost corroboration that I can find
      lies in the following facts stated by Makrizi:—</p>

    <p>On the 13th Safar, <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span> 670 (20th September 1271), Bundúḳdár arrived
      unexpectedly at Damascus, and after a brief raid against the Ismaelians
      he returned to that city. In the middle of Rabi I. (about 20–25 October)
      the Tartars made an incursion in northern Syria, and the troops of Aleppo
      retired towards Hamah. There was great alarm at Damascus; the Sultan sent
      orders to Cairo for reinforcements, and these arrived at Damascus on the
      9th November. The Sultan then advanced on Aleppo, sending corps likewise
      towards Marash (which was within the Armenian frontier) and Harran. At the
      latter place the Tartars were attacked and those in the town slaughtered;
      the rest retreated. The Sultan was back at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>Damascus, and off on a different
      expedition, by 7th December. Hence, if the travellers arrived at Ayas
      towards the latter part of November they would probably find alarm existing
      at the advance of Bundúḳdár, though matters did not turn out so serious as
      they imply.</p>

    <p>“Babylon,” of which Bundúḳdár is here styled Sultan, means Cairo, commonly
      so styled (<em>Bambellonia d’Egitto</em>) in that age. Babylon of Egypt is
      mentioned by Diodorus quoting Ctesias, by Strabo, and by Ptolemy; it was
      the station of a Roman Legion in the days of Augustus, and still survives
      in the name of <em>Babul</em>, close to old Cairo.</p>

    <p>Malik Dáhir Ruknuddín Bíbars Bundúḳdári, a native of Kipchak, was
      originally sold at Damascus for 800 dirhems (about 18<i>l.</i>), and returned by
      his purchaser because of a blemish. He was then bought by the Amir Aláuddín
      Aidekín <em>Bundúḳdár</em> (“The Arblasteer”) whose surname he afterwards adopted.
      He became the fourth of the Mameluke Sultans, and reigned from 1259 to
      1276. The two great objects of his life were the repression of the Tartars
      and the expulsion of the Christians from Syria, so that his reign was one
      of constant war and enormous activity. William of Tripoli, in the work
      above mentioned, says: “Bondogar, as a soldier, was not inferior to Julius
      Caesar, nor in malignity to Nero.” He admits, however, that the Sultan
      was sober, chaste, just to his own people, and even kind to his Christian
      subjects; whilst Makrizi calls him one of the best princes that ever
      reigned over Musulmans. Yet if we take Bibars as painted by this admiring
      historian and by other Arabic documents, the second of Friar William’s
      comparisons is justified, for he seems almost a devil in malignity as well
      as in activity. More than once he played tennis at Damascus and Cairo
      within the same week. A strange sample of the man is the letter which
      he wrote to Boemond, Prince of Antioch and Tripoli, to announce to him
      the capture of the former city. After an ironically polite address to
      Boemond as having by the loss of his great city had his title changed from
      Princeship (<em>Al-Brensíyah</em>) to Countship (<em>Al-Komasíyah</em>), and describing
      his own devastations round Tripoli, he comes to the attack of Antioch: “We
      carried the place, sword in hand, at the 4th hour of Saturday, the 4th day
      of Ramadhán, ... Hadst thou but seen thy Knights trodden under the hoofs
      of the horses! thy palaces invaded by plunderers and ransacked for booty!
      thy treasures weighed out by the hundredweight! thy ladies (<em>Dámátaka</em>,
      ‘tes <span class="smcap">Dames</span>’) bought and sold with thine own gear, at four for a dinár!
      hadst thou but seen thy churches demolished, thy crosses sawn in sunder,
      thy garbled Gospels hawked about before the sun, the tombs of thy nobles
      cast to the ground; thy foe the Moslem treading thy Holy of the Holies; the
      monk, the priest, the deacon slaughtered on the Altar; the rich given up to
      misery; princes of royal blood reduced to slavery! Couldst thou but have
      seen the flames devouring thy halls; thy dead cast into the fires temporal
      with the fires eternal hard at hand; the churches of Paul and of Cosmas
      rocking and going down—, then wouldst thou have said, ‘Would God that I
      were dust!’ ... As not a man hath escaped to tell thee the tale, <span class="smcap">I tell it
      thee</span>!”</p>

    <p>A little later, when a mission went to treat with Boemond, Bibars himself
      accompanied it in disguise, to have a look at the defences of Tripoli. In
      drawing out the terms, the Envoys styled Boemond <em>Count</em>, not <em>Prince</em>, as
      in the letter just quoted. He lost patience at their persistence, and made
      a movement which alarmed them. Bibars nudged the Envoy Mohiuddin (who tells
      the story) with his foot to give up the point, and the treaty was made. On
      their way back the Sultan laughed heartily at their narrow escape, “sending
      to the devil all the counts and princes on the face of the earth.”</p>

      had, however, considerable possessions and great influence in Cilician
      Armenia, and how much they were mixed up in its affairs is shown by
      a circumstance related by Makrizi. In 1285, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>when Sultan Mansúr, the
      successor of Bundúḳdár, was besieging the Castle of Markab, there arrived
      in Camp the Commander of the Temple (<em>Kamandúr-ul Dewet</em>) of the Country
      of Armenia, charged to negotiate on the part of the King of Sis (<i>i.e.</i> of

    and asked many questions as to their welfare, and how they had sped. They
    replied that they had in verity sped well, seeing that they found the Kaan
    well and safe. Then they presented the credentials and letters which they
    had received from the Pope, which pleased him right well; and after that
    they produced the Oil from the Sepulchre, and at that also he was very

    <p>What the four characters acquired by Marco were is open to discussion.</p>

    <p>The Chronicle of the Mongol Emperors rendered by Gaubil mentions, as
      characters used in their Empire, the Uíghúr, the Persian and Arabic, that
      of the Lamas (Tibetan), that of the Niuché, introduced by the Kin Dynasty,
      the Khitán, and the <em>Báshpah</em> character, a syllabic alphabet arranged, on
      the basis of the Tibetan and Sanskrit letters chiefly, by a learned chief
      Lama so-called, under the orders of Kublai, and established by edict in
      1269 as the official character. Coins bearing this character, and dating
      from 1308 to 1354, are extant. The forms of the Niuché and Khitán were
      devised in imitation of Chinese writing, but are supposed to be syllabic.
      Of the Khitán but one inscription was known, and no key. “The Khitan
      had two national scripts, the ‘small characters’ (<em>hsiao tzŭ</em>) and the
      ‘large characters’ (<em>ta tzŭ</em>).” S. W. Bushell, <cite>Insc. in the Juchen and

      dictionary, discovered by Dr. F. Hirth and now kept in the Royal Library,
      Berlin.—H.&nbsp;Y. and H.&nbsp;C.</p>

    <p>Chinghiz and his first successors used the Uíghúr, and sometimes the
      Chinese character. Of the Uíghúr character we give a specimen in Bk. IV. It
      is of Syriac origin, undoubtedly introduced into Eastern Turkestan by the
      early Nestorian missions, probably in the 8th or 9th century. The oldest
      known example of this character so applied, the <cite>Kudatku Bilik</cite>, a didactic
      poem in Uíghúr (a branch of Oriental Turkish), dating from <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1069, was
      published by Prof. Vámbéry in 1870. A new edition of the <cite>Kudatku Bilik</cite>
      was published at St. Petersburg, in 1891, by Dr. W. Radloff. Vámbéry had
      a pleasing illustration of the origin of the Uíghúr character, when he
      received a visit at Pesth from certain Nestorians of Urumia on a begging
      tour. On being shown the original MS. of the <cite>Kudatku Bilik</cite>, they read
      the character easily, whilst much to their astonishment they could not
      understand a word of what was written. This Uíghúr is the basis of the
      modern Mongol and Manchu characters. (Cf. E. Bretschneider, <cite>Mediæval
      Researches</cite>, I. pp. 236, 263.)—H.&nbsp;Y. and H.&nbsp;C.</p>

    <p>[At the village of Keuyung Kwan, 40 miles north of Peking, in the sub-prefecture
      of Ch’ang Ping, in the Chih-li province, the road from Peking to
      Kalgan runs beyond the pass of Nankau, under an archway, a view of which
      will be found at the end of this volume, on which were engraved, in 1345,
      two large inscriptions in six different languages: Sanskrit, Tibetan,

      xvii. p. 331, and N.S., vol. v. p. 14) to be Neuchih, Niuché, Niuchen or
      Juchen. M. Devéria has shown that the inscription is written in <em>Si Hia</em>,
      or the language of Tangut, and gave a facsimile of a stone stèle (<em>pei</em>)
      in this language kept in the great Monastery of the Clouds (Ta Yun Ssŭ)
      at Liangchau in Kansuh, together with a translation of the Chinese text,
      engraved on the reverse side of the slab. M. Devéria thinks that this
      writing was borrowed by the Kings of Tangut from the one derived in 920
      by the Khitans from the Chinese. (<em>Stèle Si-Hia de Leang-tcheou</em> ... <cite>J.

    <p>The orders of the Great Kaan are stated to have been published habitually
      in six languages, viz., Mongol, Uíghúr, Arabic, Persian, Tangutan (Si-Hia),
      and Chinese.—H.&nbsp;Y. and H.&nbsp;C.</p>

    <p>Gházán Khan of Persia is said to have understood Mongol, Arabic, Persian,
      something of Kashmiri, of Tibetan, of Chinese, and a little of the <em>Frank</em>
      tongue (probably French).</p>

    <p>The annals of the Ming Dynasty, which succeeded the Mongols in China,
      mention the establishment in the 11th moon of the 5th year Yong-lo (1407)
      of the <em>Sse yi kwan</em>, a linguistic office for diplomatic purposes. The
      languages to be studied were Niuché, Mongol, Tibetan, Sanskrit, Bokharan
      (Persian?), Uíghúr, Burmese, and Siamese. To these were added by the Manchu
      Dynasty two languages called <em>Papeh</em> and <em>Pehyih</em>, both dialects of the
      S.W. frontier. (See <i>infra</i>, Bk. II. ch. lvi.–lvii., and notes.) Since 1382,
      however, official interpreters had to translate Mongol texts; they were
      selected among the Academicians, and their service (which was independent
      of the <em>Sse yi kwan</em> when this was created) was under the control of the
      <em>Han-lin-yuen</em>. There may have been similar institutions under the Yuen,
      but we have no proof of it. At all events, such an office could not then
      be called <em>Sse yi kwan</em> (<em>Sse yi</em>, Barbarians from four sides); Niuché
      (Niuchen) was taught in Yong-lo’s office, but not Manchu. The <em>Sse yi
      kwan</em> must not be confounded with the <em>Hui t’ong kwan</em>, the office for the
      reception of tributary envoys, to which it was annexed in 1748. (<cite>Gaubil</cite>,

    <p>Pauthier supposes Mark’s four acquisitions to have been <em>Báshpah-Mongol,
      Arabic, Uighúr</em>, and <em>Chinese</em>. I entirely reject the Chinese. Sir H. Yule
      adds: “We shall see no reason to believe that he knew either language or
      character” [Chinese]. The blunders Polo made in saying that the name of the
      city, Suju, signifies in our tongue “Earth” and Kinsay “Heaven” show he did
      not know the Chinese characters, but we read in Bk. II. ch. lxviii.: “And
      Messer Marco Polo himself, of whom this Book speaks, did govern this city
      (Yanju) for three full years, by the order of the Great Kaan.” It seems
      to me [H.&nbsp;C.] hardly possible that Marco could have for three years been
      governor of so important and so Chinese a city as Yangchau, in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>heart
      of the Empire, without acquiring a knowledge of the spoken language.—H.&nbsp;C.
      The other three languages seem highly probable. The fourth may have been
      Tibetan. But it is more likely that he counted separately two varieties of
      the same character (<i>e.g.</i> of the Arabic and Persian) as two “<i lang="fr">lettres de
      leur escriptures</i>.”—H.&nbsp;Y. and H.&nbsp;C.</p>

      of Government, as we may see from a passage of Rashiduddin in D’Ohsson,
      which says that “there were always to be found in every city from one to
      two hundred <em>Ilchis</em>, who forced the citizens to furnish them with free

  <div class="subh4">How Mark returned from the Mission whereon he had been sent.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Mark returned from his ambassage he presented himself before the
    Emperor, and after making his report of the business with which he was
    charged, and its successful accomplishment, he went on to give an account
    in a pleasant and intelligent manner of all the novelties and strange
    things that he had seen and heard; insomuch that the Emperor and all such
    as heard his story were surprised, and said: “If this young man live, he
    will assuredly come to be a person of great worth and ability.” And so from
    that time forward he was always entitled <span class="smcap">Messer Marco Polo</span>, and thus we
    shall style him henceforth in this Book of ours, as is but right.</p>

  <p>Thereafter Messer Marco abode in the Kaan’s employment some seventeen
    years, continually going and coming, hither and thither, on the missions
    that were entrusted to him by the Lord [and sometimes, with the permission
    and authority of the Great Kaan, on his own private affairs.] And, as he
    knew all the sovereign’s ways, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>like a sensible man he always took much
    pains to gather knowledge of anything that would be likely to interest
    him, and then on his return to Court he would relate everything in regular
    order, and thus the Emperor came to hold him in great love and favour. And
    for this reason also he would employ him the oftener on the most weighty
    and most distant of his missions. These Messer Marco ever carried out with
    discretion and success, God be thanked. So the Emperor became ever more
    partial to him, and treated him with the greater distinction, and kept him
    so close to his person that some of the Barons waxed very envious thereat.
    And thus it came about that Messer Marco Polo had knowledge of, or had
    actually visited, a greater number of the different countries of the World
    than any other man; the more that he was always giving his mind to get
    knowledge, and to spy out and enquire into everything in order to have
    matter to relate to the Lord.</p>

  <div class="subh4">How Messer Nicolo, Messer Maffeo, and Messer Marco, asked leave of the
    Great Kaan to go their way.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Two Brothers and Mark had abode with the Lord all that time that
    you have been told [having meanwhile acquired great wealth in jewels and
    gold], they began among themselves to have thoughts about returning to
    their own country; and indeed it was time. [For, to say nothing of the
    length and infinite perils of the way, when they considered the Kaan’s
    great age, they doubted whether, in the event of his death before their
    departure, they would ever be able to get home.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIp1" href="#Note_XVIIp1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a>] <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>They applied to
    him several times for leave to go, presenting their request with great
    respect, but he had such a partiality for them, and liked so much to have
    them about him, that nothing on earth would persuade him to let them go.</p>

  <p>Now it came to pass in those days that the Queen <span class="smcap">Bolgana</span>, wife of <span class="smcap">Argon</span>,
    Lord of the Levant, departed this life. And in her Will she had desired
    that no Lady should take her place, or succeed her as Argon’s wife, except
    one of her own family [which existed in Cathay]. Argon therefore despatched
    three of his Barons, by name respectively <span class="smcap">Oulatay</span>, <span class="smcap">Apusca</span>, and <span class="smcap">Coja</span>, as
    ambassadors to the Great Kaan, attended by a very gallant company, in order
    to bring back as his bride a lady of the family of Queen Bolgana, his late
    wife.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIp2" href="#Note_XVIIp2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>When these three Barons had reached the Court of the Great Kaan, they
    delivered their message, explaining wherefore they were come. The Kaan
    received them with all honour and hospitality, and then sent for a lady
    whose name was <span class="smcap">Cocachin</span>, who was of the family of the deceased Queen
    Bolgana. She was a maiden of 17, a very beautiful and charming person, and
    on her arrival at Court she was presented to the three Barons as the Lady
    chosen in compliance with their demand. They declared that the Lady pleased
    them well.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIp3" href="#Note_XVIIp3" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>Meanwhile Messer Marco chanced to return from India, whither he had gone
    as the Lord’s ambassador, and made his report of all the different things
    that he had seen in his travels, and of the sundry seas over which he had
    voyaged. And the three Barons, having seen that Messer Nicolo, Messer
    Maffeo, and Messer Marco were not only Latins, but men of marvellous good
    sense withal, took thought among themselves to get the three to travel
    with them, their intention being to return to their country by sea, on
    account of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>great fatigue of that long land journey for a lady. And the
    ambassadors were the more desirous to have their company, as being aware
    that those three had great knowledge and experience of the Indian Sea and
    the countries by which they would have to pass, and especially Messer
    Marco. So they went to the Great Kaan, and begged as a favour that he would
    send the three Latins with them, as it was their desire to return home by sea.</p>

  <p>The Lord, having that great regard that I have mentioned for those
    three Latins, was very loath to do so [and his countenance showed great
    dissatisfaction]. But at last he did give them permission to depart,
    enjoining them to accompany the three Barons and the Lady.</p>

      (according to strange Mongol custom) the wife successively of Ábáḳa and of
      his son <span class="smcap">Arghun</span>, the Argon of the text, Mongol sovereign of Persia. She died
      on the banks of the Kur in Georgia, 7th April, 1286. She belonged to the

  <div class="subh4">How the Two Brothers and Messer Marco took leave of the Great Kaan, and
    returned to their own Country.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> when the Prince saw that the Two Brothers and Messer Marco were ready
    to set forth, he called them all three to his presence, and gave them two
    golden Tablets of Authority, which should secure them liberty of passage
    through all his dominions, and by means of which, whithersoever they
    should go, all necessaries would be provided for them, and for all their
    company, and whatever they might choose to order.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIIp1" href="#Note_XVIIIp1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> He charged them
    also with messages to the King of France, the King of England,<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIIp2" href="#Note_XVIIIp2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> the
    King of Spain, and the other kings of Christendom. He then caused thirteen
    ships to be equipt, each of which had four masts, and often spread twelve
    sails.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIIp3" href="#Note_XVIIIp3" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> And I could easily give you all particulars about these,
    but as it would be so long an affair I will not enter upon this now, but
    hereafter, when time and place are suitable. [Among the said ships were at
    least four or five that carried crews of 250 or 260 men.]</p>

  <p>And when the ships had been equipt, the Three Barons and the Lady, and the
    Two Brothers and Messer Marco, took leave of the Great Kaan, and went on
    board their ships with a great company of people, and with all necessaries
    provided for two years by the Emperor. They put forth to sea, and after
    sailing for some three months they arrived at a certain Island towards the
    South, which is called <span class="smcap">Java</span>,<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIIp4" href="#Note_XVIIIp4" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> and in which there are many wonderful
    things which we shall tell you all about by-and-bye. Quitting this Island
    they continued <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>to navigate the Sea of India for eighteen months more before
    they arrived whither they were bound, meeting on their way also with many
    marvels, of which we shall tell hereafter.</p>

  <p>And when they got thither they found that Argon was dead, so the Lady was
    delivered to <span class="smcap">Casan</span>, his son.</p>

  <p>But I should have told you that it is a fact that, when they embarked, they
    were in number some 600 persons, without counting the mariners; but nearly
    all died by the way, so that only eight survived.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIIp5" href="#Note_XVIIIp5" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>The sovereignty when they arrived was held by <span class="smcap">Kiacatu</span>, so they commended
    the Lady to him, and executed all their commission. And when the Two
    Brothers and Messer Marco had executed their charge in full, and done
    all that the Great Kaan had enjoined on them in regard to the Lady, they
    took their leave and set out upon their journey.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIIp6" href="#Note_XVIIIp6" class="fnanchor">{6}</a> And before their
    departure, Kiacatu gave them four golden tablets of authority, two of which
    bore gerfalcons, one bore lions, whilst the fourth was plain, and having on
    them inscriptions which directed that the three Ambassadors should receive
    honour and service all through the land as if rendered to the Prince in
    person, and that horses and all provisions, and everything necessary,
    should be supplied to them. And so they found in fact; for throughout the
    country they received ample and excellent supplies of everything needful;
    and many a time indeed, as I may tell you, they were furnished with 200
    horsemen, more or less, to escort them on their way in safety. And this
    was all the more needful because Kiacatu was not the legitimate Lord, and
    therefore the people had less scruple to do mischief than if they had had a
    lawful prince.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIIp7" href="#Note_XVIIIp7" class="fnanchor">{7}</a></p>

  <p>Another thing too must be mentioned, which does credit to those three
    Ambassadors, and shows for what <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>great personages they were held. The Great
    Kaan regarded them with such trust and affection, that he had confided
    to their charge the Queen Cocachin, as well as the daughter of the King
    of Manzi,<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIIIp8" href="#Note_XVIIIp8" class="fnanchor">{8}</a> to conduct to Argon the Lord of all the Levant. And
    those two great ladies who were thus entrusted to them they watched over
    and guarded as if they had been daughters of their own, until they had
    transferred them to the hands of their Lord; whilst the ladies, young and
    fair as they were, looked on each of those three as a father, and obeyed
    them accordingly. Indeed, both Casan, who is now the reigning prince, and
    the Queen Cocachin his wife, have such a regard for the Envoys that there
    is nothing they would not do for them. And when the three Ambassadors took
    leave of that Lady to return to their own country, she wept for sorrow at
    the parting.</p>

  <p>What more shall I say? Having left Kiacatu they travelled day by day till
    they came to Trebizond, and thence to Constantinople, from Constantinople
    to Negropont, and from Negropont to Venice. And this was in the year 1295
    of Christ’s Incarnation.</p>

  <p>And now that I have rehearsed all the Prologue as you have heard, we shall
    begin the Book of the Description of the Divers Things that Messer Marco
    met with in his Travels.</p>

      an error of Ramusio’s, as “it is well known that Chinese vessels do not
      carry any kind of topsail.” This is, however, a mistake, for they do
      sometimes carry a small topsail of cotton cloth (and formerly, it would
      seem from Lecomte, even a topgallant sail at times), though only in quiet
      weather. And the evidence as to the number of sails carried by the great
      Chinese junks of the Middle Ages, which evidently made a great impression
      on Western foreigners, is irresistible. Friar Jordanus, who saw them in
      Malabar, says: “With a fair wind they carry ten sails;” Ibn Batuta: “One
      of these great junks carries from three sails to twelve;” Joseph, the
      Indian, speaking of those that traded to India in the 15th century: “They
      were very great, and had sometimes twelve sails, with innumerable rowers.”

      “From the day that they embarked until their arrival there died of mariners
      and others on board 600 persons; and of the three ambassadors only one
      survived, whose name was Goza (<em>Coja</em>); but of the ladies and damsels died
      but one.”</p>

    <p>It is worth noting that in the case of an embassy sent to Cathay a few
      years later by Gházán Khan, on the return by this same route to Persia, the
      chief of the two Persian ambassadors, and the Great Khan’s envoy, who was
      in company, both died by the way. Their voyage, too, seems to have been
      nearly as long as Polo’s; for they were seven years absent from Persia, and
      of these only four in China. (See <cite>Wassáf</cite> in <cite>Elliot</cite>, III. 47.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVIIIp6" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIIIp6" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—Ramusio’s version states that on learning Arghún’s death (which
      they probably did on landing at Hormuz), they sent word of their arrival
      to Kiacatu, who directed them to conduct the lady to Casan, who was then
      in the region of the <em>Arbre Sec</em> (the Province of Khorasan) guarding the
      frontier passes with 60,000 men, and that they did so, and then turned
      back to Kiacatu (probably at Tabriz), and stayed at his Court nine months.
      Even the Geog. Text seems to imply that they had become personally known
      to Casan, and I have no doubt that Ramusio’s statement is an authentic
      expansion of the original narrative by Marco himself, or on his authority.</p>

    <p>Arghún Khan died 10th March, 1291. He was succeeded (23rd July) by his
      brother Kaikhátú (<em>Quiacatu</em> of Polo), who was put to death 24th March,
      1295.</p>

    <p>We learn from Hammer’s History of the Ilkhans that when Gházán, the son of
      Arghún (<em>Casan</em> of Polo), who had the government of the Khorasan frontier,
      was on his return to his post from Tabriz, where his uncle Kaikhatu had
      refused to see him, “he met at Abher the ambassador whom he had sent to
      the Great Khan to obtain in marriage a relative of the Great Lady Bulghán.
      This envoy brought with him the Lady <span class="smcap">Kúkáchin</span> (our author’s <em>Cocachin</em>),
      with presents from the Emperor, and the marriage was celebrated with due
      festivity.” Abher lies a little west of Kazvín.</p>

    <p>Hammer is not, I find, here copying from Wassáf, and I have not been able
      to procure a thorough search of the work of Rashiduddin, which probably was
      his authority. As well as the date can be made out from the History of the
      Ilkhans, Gházán must have met his bride towards the end of 1293, or quite
      the beginning of 1294. Rashiduddin in another place mentions the fair lady
      from Cathay; “The <em>ordu</em> (or establishment) of Tukiti Khatun was given
      to <span class="smcap">Kukachi Khatun</span>, who had been brought from the Kaan’s Court, and who
      was a kinswoman of the late chief Queen Bulghán. Kúkáchi, the wife of the
      Padshah of Islam, Gházán Khan, died in the month of Shaban, 695,” <i>i.e.</i> in
      June, 1296, so that the poor girl did not long survive her promotion. (See
      <cite>Hammer’s Ilch.</cite> II. 20, and 8, and I. 273; and <cite>Quatremère’s Rashiduddin</cite>,
      p. 97.) Kukachin was the name also of the wife of Chingkim, Kublai’s
      favourite son; but she was of the Kungurát tribe. (<cite>Deguignes</cite>, IV. 179.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVIIIp7" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIIIp7" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.</a>—Here Ramusio’s text says: “During this journey Messers Nicolo,
      Maffeo, and Marco heard the news that the Great Khan had departed this
      life; and this caused them to give up all hope of returning to those parts.”</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVIIIp8" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIIIp8" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.</a>—This Princess of Manzi, or Southern China, is mentioned only in the
      Geog. Text and in the Crusca, which is based thereon. I find no notice of
      her among the wives of Gházán or otherwise.</p>

    <p>On the fall of the capital of the Sung Dynasty—the Kinsay of Polo—in 1276,
      the Princesses of that Imperial family were sent to Peking, and were
      graciously treated by Kublai’s favourite Queen, the Lady Jamui. This young
      lady was, no doubt, one of those captive princesses who had been brought up
      at the Court of Khánbálik. (See <cite>De Mailla</cite>, IX. 376, and <i>infra</i> Bk. II. ch.
      lxv., note 6.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Here the Book begins; and first it speaks of the Lesser Hermenia.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> are two Hermenias, the Greater and the Less. The Lesser Hermenia is
    governed by a certain King, who maintains a just rule in his dominions, but
    is himself subject to the Tartar.<a id="NoteAnchor_I11" href="#Note_I11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> The country contains numerous
    towns and villages,<a id="NoteAnchor_I12" href="#Note_I12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> and has everything in plenty; moreover, it is a
    great country for sport in the chase of all manner of beasts and birds. It
    is, however, by no means a healthy region, but grievously the reverse.<a id="NoteAnchor_I13" href="#Note_I13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a>
    In days of old the nobles there were valiant men, and did doughty deeds
    of arms; but nowadays they are poor creatures, and good at nought, unless
    it be at boozing; they are great at that. Howbeit, they have a city upon
    the sea, which is called <span class="smcap">Layas</span>, at which there is a great trade. For you
    must know that all the spicery, and the cloths of silk and gold, and the
    other valuable wares that come from the interior, are brought to that city.
    And the merchants of Venice and Genoa, and other countries, come thither to
    sell their goods, and to buy what they lack. And whatsoever persons would
    travel to the interior (of the East), merchants or others, they take their
    way by this city of Layas.<a id="NoteAnchor_I14" href="#Note_I14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

    Turcomania.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_I11" href="#NoteAnchor_I11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The <cite>Petite Hermenie</cite> of the Middle Ages was quite distinct from
      the Armenia Minor of the ancient geographers, which name the latter applied
      to the western portion of Armenia, west of the Euphrates, and immediately
      north of Cappadocia.</p>

    <div class="figleft illowp44" id="i042">
      <img class="w100" src="images/i042.jpg" alt="" />
      <div class="caption">Coin of King Hetum and his Queen Isabel.</div>
    </div>

    <p>But when the old Armenian monarchy was broken up (1079–80), Rupen, a
      kinsman of the Bagratid Kings, with many of his countrymen, took refuge
      in the Taurus. His first descendants ruled as <em>barons</em>, a title adopted
      apparently from the Crusaders, but still preserved in Armenia. Leon, the
      great-great-grandson of Rupen, was consecrated King under the supremacy
      of the Pope and the Western Empire in 1198. The kingdom was at its zenith
      under Hetum or Hayton I., husband of Leon’s daughter Isabel (1224–1269); he
      was, however, prudent enough to make an early submission to the Mongols,
      and remained ever staunch to them, which brought his territory constantly
      under the flail of Egypt. It included at one time all Cilicia, with many
      cities of Syria and the ancient Armenia Minor, of Isauria and Cappadocia.
      The male line of Rupen becoming extinct in 1342, the kingdom passed to John
      de Lusignan, of the royal house of Cyprus, and in 1375 it was put an end to
      by the Sultan of Egypt. Leon VI., the ex-king, into whose mouth Froissart
      puts some extraordinary geography, had a pension of 1000<i>l.</i> a year granted
      him by our Richard II., and died at Paris in 1398.</p>

    <p>The chief remaining vestige of this little monarchy is the continued
      existence of a <em>Catholicos</em> of part of the Armenian Church at Sis, which
      was the royal residence. Some Armenian communities still remain both in
      hills and plains; and the former, the more independent and industrious,
      still speak a corrupt Armenian.</p>

    <p>Polo’s contemporary, Marino Sanuto, compares the kingdom of the Pope’s
      faithful Armenians to one between the teeth of four fierce beasts, the
      <em>Lion</em> Tartar, the <em>Panther</em> Soldan, the Turkish <em>Wolf</em>, the Corsair
      <em>Serpent</em>.</p>

    <p>(<cite>Dulaurier</cite>, in <cite>J. As.</cite> sér. V. tom. xvii.; <cite>St. Martin, Arm.</cite>; <cite>Mar.
      San.</cite> p. 32; <cite>Froissart</cite>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XXII2">Bk. II. ch. xxii.</a> <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Langlois, V. en
      Cilicie</cite>, 1861, p. 19.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_I12" href="#NoteAnchor_I12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—“<i lang="fr">Maintes villes et maint chasteaux</i>.” This is a constantly
      recurring phrase, and I have generally translated it as here, believing
      <i lang="fr">chasteaux (castelli)</i> to be used in the frequent old Italian sense of a
      <em>walled</em> village or small walled town, or like the Eastern <em>Kala’</em>, applied
      in Khorasan “to everything—town, village, or private residence—surrounded
      by a wall of earth.” (<cite>Ferrier</cite>, p. 292; see also <cite>A. Conolly</cite>, I. p. 211.)
      Martini, in his <cite>Atlas Sinensis</cite>, uses “<em>Urbes</em>, <em>oppida</em>, castella,” to
      indicate the three classes of Chinese administrative cities.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_I13" href="#NoteAnchor_I13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—“<i lang="fr">Enferme durement</i>.” So Marino Sanuto objects to Lesser Armenia
      as a place of debarkation for a crusade “<i lang="la">quia terra est infirma</i>.”
      Langlois, speaking of the Cilician plain: “In this region once so fair,
      now covered with swamps and brambles, fever decimates a population which
      is yearly diminishing, has nothing to oppose to the scourge but incurable
      apathy, and will end by disappearing altogether,” etc. (<cite>Voyage</cite>, p. 65.)
      Cilician Armenia retains its reputation for sport, and is much frequented
      by our naval officers for that object. Ayas is noted for the extraordinary
      abundance of turtles.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

    <p><a id="Note_I14" href="#NoteAnchor_I14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—The phrase twice used in this passage for the <em>Interior</em> is <i lang="la">Fra
      terre</i>, an Italianism (<i lang="it">Fra terra</i>, or, as it stands in the Geog. Latin,
      “<i lang="la">infra terram Orientis</i>”), which, however, Murray and Pauthier have
      read as an allusion to the <em>Euphrates</em>, an error based apparently on a
      marginal gloss in the published edition of the Soc. de Géographie. It is
      true that the province of Comagene under the Greek Empire got the name of
      <em>Euphratesia</em>, or in Arabic <em>Furátíyah</em>, but that was not in question here.
      The great trade of Ayas was with Tabriz, <i>viâ</i> Sivas, Erzingan, and Erzrum,
      as we see in Pegolotti. Elsewhere, too, in Polo we find the phrase <i lang="la">fra
      terre</i> used, where Euphrates could possibly have no concern, as in relation
      to India and Oman. (See Bk. III. chs. xxix. and xxxviii., and notes in each
      case.)</p>

    <p>With regard to the phrase <em>spicery</em> here and elsewhere, it should be noted
      that the Italian <i lang="it">spezerie</i> included a vast deal more than ginger and other
      things “hot i’ the mouth.” In one of Pegolotti’s lists of <i lang="it">spezerie</i> we
      find drugs, dye-stuffs, metals, wax, cotton, etc.</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Province of Turcomania.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> Turcomania there are three classes of people. First, there are the
    Turcomans; these are worshippers of Mahommet, a rude people with an uncouth
    language of their own.<a id="NoteAnchor_II11" href="#Note_II11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> They dwell among mountains and downs where
    they find good pasture, for their occupation is cattle-keeping. Excellent
    horses, known as <em>Turquans</em>, are reared in their country, and also very
    valuable mules. The other two classes are the Armenians and the Greeks, who
    live mixt with the former in the towns and villages, occupying themselves
    with trade and handicrafts. They weave the finest and handsomest carpets
    in the world, and also a great quantity of fine and rich silks of cramoisy
    and other colours, and plenty of other stuffs. Their chief cities are
    <span class="smcap">Conia</span>, <span class="smcap">Savast</span> [where the glorious Messer Saint Blaise suffered martyrdom],
    and <span class="smcap">Casaria</span>, besides many other towns and bishops’ sees, of which we shall
    not speak at present, for it would be too long a matter. These people are
    subject to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>Tartar of the Levant as their Suzerain.<a id="NoteAnchor_II12" href="#Note_II12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> We will now
    leave this province, and speak of the Greater Armenia.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_II11" href="#NoteAnchor_II11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Ricold of Montecroce, a contemporary of Polo, calls the Turkmans
      <i lang="la">homines bestiales</i>. In our day Ainsworth notes of a Turkman village: “The
      dogs were very ferocious; ... the people only a little better.” (<cite>J. R. G.
      S.</cite> X. 292.) The ill report of the people of this region did not begin with
      the Turkmans, for the Emperor Constantine Porphyrog. quotes a Greek proverb
      to the disparagement of the three <em>kappas</em>, Cappadocia, Crete, and Cilicia.
      (In <cite>Banduri</cite>, I. 6.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_II12" href="#NoteAnchor_II12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—In Turcomania Marco perhaps embraces a great part of Asia Minor,
      but he especially means the territory of the decaying Seljukian monarchy,
      usually then called by Asiatics <em>Rúm</em>, as the Ottoman Empire is now, and
      the capital of which was Iconium, <span class="smcap">Kuniyah</span>, the Conia of the text, and Coyne
      of Joinville. Ibn Batuta calls the whole country Turkey (<em>Al-Turkíyah</em>),
      and the people <em>Turkmán</em>; exactly likewise does Ricold (<em>Thurchia</em> and
      <em>Thurchimanni</em>). Hayton’s account of the various classes of inhabitants
      is quite the same in substance as Polo’s. [The Turkmans emigrated from
      Turkestan to Asia Minor before the arrival of the Seljukid Turks. “Their
      villages,” says Cuinet, <cite>Turquie d’Asie</cite>, II. p. 767, “are distinguished
      by the peculiarity of the houses being built of sun-baked bricks, whereas
      it is the general habit in the country to build them of earth or a kind of
      plaster, called <em>djès</em>”—H.&nbsp;C.] The migratory and pastoral Turkmans still
      exist in this region, but the Kurds of like habits have taken their place
      to a large extent. The fine carpets and silk fabrics appear to be no longer
      produced here, any more than the excellent horses of which Polo speaks,
      which must have been the remains of the famous old breed of Cappadocia. [It
      appears, however (Vital Cuinet’s <cite>Turquie d’Asie</cite>, I. p. 224), that fine
      carpets are still manufactured at Koniah, also a kind of striped cotton
      cloth, called <em>Aladja</em>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>A grant of privileges to the Genoese by Leon II., King of Lesser Armenia,
      dated 23rd December, 1288, alludes to the export of horses and mules,
      etc., from Ayas, and specifies the duties upon them. The horses now of
      repute in Asia as Turkman come from the east of the Caspian. And Asia Minor
      generally, once the mother of so many breeds of high repute, is now poorer
      in horses than any province of the Ottoman empire.</p>

    <p>(<cite>Pereg. Quat.</cite> p. 114; <cite>I. B.</cite> II. 255 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Hayton</cite>, ch. xiii.; <cite>Liber
      Jurium Reip. Januensis</cite>, II. 184; <cite>Tchihatcheff, As. Min.</cite>, 2<sup>de</sup> partie, 631.)</p>

    <p>[The Seljukian Sultanate of Iconium or Rúm, was founded at the expense of
      the Byzantines by Suleiman (1074–1081); the last three sovereigns of the
      dynasty contemporaneous with Marco Polo are Ghiath ed-din Kaïkhosru III.
      (1267–1283), Ghiath ed-din Mas’ud II. (1283–1294), Ala ed-din Kaïkobad III.
      (1294–1308), when this kingdom was destroyed by the Mongols of Persia.
      Privileges had been granted to Venice by Ghiath ed-din Kaïkhosru I. (✛1211),
      and his sons Izz ed-din Kaikaus (1211–1220), and Ala ed-din Kaïkobad
      I. (1220–1237); the diploma of 1220 is unfortunately the only one of the
      three known to be preserved. (Cf. Heyd, I. p. 302.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Though the authors quoted above seem to make no distinction between Turks
      and Turkmans, that which we still understand does appear to have been made
      in the 12th century: “That there may be some distinction, at least in name,
      between those who made themselves a king, and thus achieved such glory, and
      those who still abide in their primitive barbarism and adhere to their old
      way of life, the former are nowadays termed <em>Turks</em>, the latter by their
      old name of <em>Turkomans</em>.” (<cite>William of Tyre</cite>, i. 7.)</p>

    <p>Casaria is <span class="smcap">Kaisaríya</span>, the ancient Caesareia of Cappadocia, close to the
      foot of the great Mount Argaeus. <em>Savast</em> is the Armenian form (<em>Sevasd</em>)
      of Sebaste, the modern <span class="smcap">Sivas</span>. The three cities, Iconium, Caesareia, and
      Sebaste, were metropolitan sees under the Catholicos of Sis.</p>

    <p>[The ruins of Sebaste are situated at about 6 miles to the east of modern
      Sivas, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>near the village of Gavraz, on the <em>Kizil Irmak</em>. In the 11th
      century, the King of Armenia, Senecherim, made his capital of Sebaste. It
      belonged after to the Seljukid Turks, and was conquered in 1397 by Bayezid
      Ilderim with Tokat, Castambol and Sinope. (Cf. <cite>Vital Cuinet</cite>.)</p>

    <p>One of the oldest churches in Sivas is St. George (<em>Sourp-Kévork</em>),
      occupied by the Greeks, but claimed by the Armenians; it is situated near
      the centre of the town, in what is called the “Black Earth,” the spot
      where Timur is said to have massacred the garrison. A few steps north of
      St. George is the Church of St. Blasius, occupied by the Roman Catholic
      Armenians. The tomb of St. Blasius, however, is shown in another part
      of the town, near the citadel mount, and the ruins of a very beautiful
      Seljukian Medresseh. (From a MS. Note by Sir H. Yule. The information had
      been supplied by the American Missionaries to General Sir C. Wilson, and
      forwarded by him to Sir H. Yule.)</p>

    <p>It must be remembered that at the time of the Seljuk Turks, there were
      four Medressehs at Sivas, and a university as famous as that of Amassia.
      Children to the number of 1000, each a bearer of a copy of the Koran, were
      crushed to death under the feet of the horses of Timur, and buried in the
      “Black Earth”; the garrison of 4000 soldiers were buried alive.</p>

    <p>St. Blasius, Bishop of Sebaste, was martyred in 316 by order of Agricola,
      Governor of Cappadocia and Lesser Armenia, during the reign of Licinius.
      His feast is celebrated by the Latin Church on the 3rd of February, and by
      the Greek Church on the 11th of February. He is the patron of the Republic
      of Ragusa in Dalmatia, and in France of wool-carders.</p>

    <p>At the village of Hullukluk, near Sivas, was born in 1676 Mekhitar, founder
      of the well-known Armenian Order, which has convents at Venice, Vienna, and
      Trieste.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <p>The country is indeed a passing great one, and in the summer it is

    a very good silver mine.<a id="NoteAnchor_III13" href="#Note_III13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a>]</p>

  <p>And you must know that it is in this country of Armenia that the Ark of
    Noah exists on the top of a certain great mountain [on the summit of which
    snow is so constant that no one can ascend;<a id="NoteAnchor_III14" href="#Note_III14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> for the snow never
    melts, and is constantly added to by new falls. Below, however, the snow
    does melt, and runs down, producing such rich and abundant herbage that
    in summer cattle are sent to pasture from a long way round about, and it
    never fails them. The melting snow also causes a great amount of mud on the
    mountain].</p>

  <p>The country is bounded on the south by a kingdom called Mosul, the people
    of which are Jacobite and Nestorian Christians, of whom I shall have more
    to tell you presently. On the north it is bounded by the Land of the
    Georgians, of whom also I shall speak. On the confines towards Georgiania
    there is a fountain from which oil springs in great abundance, insomuch
    that a hundred shiploads might be taken from it at one time. This oil is
    not good to use with food, but ’tis good to burn, and is also used to
    anoint camels that have the mange. People come from vast distances to fetch
    it, for in all the countries round about they have no other oil.<a id="NoteAnchor_III15" href="#Note_III15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>Now, having done with Great Armenia, we will tell you of Georgiania.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_III11" href="#NoteAnchor_III11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—[<span class="smcap">Erzinjan</span>, Erzinga, or Eriza, in the vilayet of Erzrum, was rebuilt
      in 1784, after having been destroyed by an earthquake. “Arzendjan,” says
      Ibn Batuta, II. p. 294, “is in possession of well-established markets;
      there are manufactured fine stuffs, which are called after its name.” It
      was at Erzinjan that was fought in 1244 the great battle, which placed the
      Seljuk Turks under the dependency of the Mongol Khans.—H.&nbsp;C.] I do not find
      mention of its hot springs by modern travellers, but Lazari says Armenians
      assured him of their existence. There are plenty of others <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>in Polo’s route
      through the country, as at Ilija, close to Erzrum, and at Hássan Kalá.</p>

    <p>The <em>Buckrams</em> of Arzinga are mentioned both by Pegolotti (<i>circa</i> 1340) and
      by Giov. d’Uzzano (1442). But what were they?</p>

    <p>Buckram in the modern sense is a coarse open texture of cotton or hemp,
      loaded with gum, and used to stiffen certain articles of dress. But this
      was certainly <em>not</em> the mediæval sense. Nor is it easy to bring the
      mediæval uses of the term under a single explanation. Indeed Mr. Marsh
      suggests that probably two different words have coalesced. Fr.-Michel
      says that <em>Bouqueran</em> was <em>at first</em> applied to a light cotton stuff of
      the nature of muslin, and <em>afterwards</em> to linen, but I do not see that he
      makes out this history of the application. Douet d’Arcq, in his <cite>Comptes
      de l’Argenterie</cite>, etc., explains the word simply in the modern sense, but
      there seems nothing in his text to bear this out.</p>

    <p>A quotation in Raynouard’s Romance Dictionary has “<em>Vestirs de polpra e
      de</em> bisso <em>que est</em> bocaran,” where Raynouard renders <em>bisso</em> as <em>lin</em>;
      a quotation in Ducange also makes Buckram the equivalent of Bissus; and
      Michel quotes from an inventory of 1365, “<em>unam culcitram pinctam</em> (qu.
      punctam?) <em>albam factam</em> de bisso <em>aliter</em> boquerant.”</p>

    <p>Mr. Marsh again produces quotations, in which the word is used as a
      proverbial example of <em>whiteness</em>, and inclines to think that it was a
      bleached cloth with a lustrous surface.</p>

    <p>It certainly was not <em>necessarily</em> linen. Giovanni Villani, in a passage
      which is curious in more ways than one, tells how the citizens of Florence
      established races for their troops, and, among other prizes, was one which
      consisted of a <i lang="it">Bucherame di bambagine</i> (of cotton). Polo, near the end of
      the Book (Bk. III. ch. xxxiv.), speaking of Abyssinia, says, according to
      Pauthier’s text: “<em>Et si y fait on moult beaux</em> bouquerans et autres draps
      de coton.” The G.&nbsp;T. is, indeed, more ambiguous: “<em>Il hi se font maint
      biaus dras</em> banbacin e bocaran” (cotton <em>and</em> buckram). When, however, he
      uses the same expression with reference to the delicate stuffs woven on
      the coast of Telingana, there can be no doubt that a cotton texture is
      meant, and apparently a fine muslin. (See Bk. III. ch. xviii.) Buckram
      is <em>generally</em> named as an article of price, <em>chier bouquerant</em>, <em>rice
      boquerans</em>, etc, but not always, for Polo in one passage (Bk. II. ch. xlv.)
      seems to speak of it as the clothing of the poor people of Eastern Tibet.</p>

    <p>Plano Carpini says the tunics of the Tartars were either of buckram
      (<em>bukeranum</em>), of <em>purpura</em> (a texture, perhaps velvet), or of <em>baudekin</em>,
      a cloth of gold (pp. 614–615). When the envoys of the Old Man of the
      Mountain tried to bully St. Lewis, one had a case of daggers to be offered
      in defiance, another a <em>bouqueran</em> for a winding sheet (<cite>Joinville</cite>, p. 136.)</p>

    <p>In accounts of materials for the use of Anne Boleyn in the time of her
      prosperity, <em>bokeram</em> frequently appears for “lyning and taynting” (?)
      gowns, lining sleeves, cloaks, a bed, etc., but it can scarcely have been
      for mere stiffening, as the colour of the buckram is generally specified as
      the same as that of the dress.</p>

    <p>A number of passages seem to point to a <em>quilted</em> material. Boccaccio
      (Day viii. Novel 10) speaks of a quilt (<em>coltre</em>) of the whitest buckram
      of Cyprus, and Uzzano enters buckram quilts (<em>coltre di Bucherame</em>) in a
      list of <em>Linajuoli</em>, or linen-draperies. Both his handbook and Pegolotti’s
      state repeatedly that buckrams were sold by the piece or the half-score
      pieces—never by measure. In one of Michel’s quotations (from <cite>Baudouin de
      Sebourc</cite>) we have:</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry" lang="fr">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“Gaufer li fist premiers armer d’un auqueton</div>
          <div class="i1">Qui fu de <em>bougherant</em> et <em>plaine de bon coton</em>.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Mr. Hewitt would appear to take the view that Buckram meant a quilted
      material; for, quoting from a roll of purchases made for the Court of
      Edward I., an entry for Ten Buckrams to make sleeves of, he remarks, “The
      sleeves appear to have been of <em>pourpointerie</em>,” <i>i.e.</i> quilting. (<cite>Ancient
      Armour</cite>, I. 240.)</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

    <p>This signification would embrace a large number of passages in which the
      term is used, though certainly not all. It would account for the mode or
      sale by the piece, and frequent use of the expression <em>a</em> buckram, for its
      habitual application to <em>coltre</em> or counterpanes, its use in the <em>auqueton</em>
      of Baudouin, and in the jackets of Falstaff’s “men in buckram,” as well
      as its employment in the frocks of the Mongols and Tibetans. The winter
      <em>chapkan</em>, or long tunic, of Upper India, a form of dress which, I believe,
      correctly represents that of the Mongol hosts, and is probably derived
      from them, is almost universally of quilted cotton.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This signification
      would also facilitate the transfer of meaning to the substance now called
      buckram, for that is used as a <em>kind</em> of quilting.</p>

    <p>The derivation of the word is very uncertain. Reiske says it is Arabic,
      <em>Abu-Kairám</em>, “Pannus cum intextis figuris”; Wedgwood, attaching the
      modern meaning, that it is from It., <em>bucherare</em>, to pierce full of holes,
      which might be if <em>bucherare</em> could be used in the sense of <em>puntare</em>,
      or the French <em>piquer</em>; Marsh connects it with the <em>bucking</em> of linen;
      and D’Avezac thinks it was a stuff that took its name from <em>Bokhara</em>.
      If the name be local, as so many names of stuffs are, the French form
      rather suggests <em>Bulgaria</em>. [Heyd, II. 703, says that Buckram (Bucherame)
      was principally manufactured at Erzinjan (Armenia), Mush, and Mardin
      (Kurdistan), Ispahan (Persia), and in India, etc. It was shipped to the
      west at Constantinople, Satalia, Acre, and Famagusta; the name is derived
      from Bokhara.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      in honour of Theodosius the Great; the present name was given by the
      Seljukid Turks, and it means “Roman Country”; it was taken by Chinghiz Khan
      and Timur, but neither kept it long. Odorico (<cite>Cathay</cite>, I. p. 46), speaking
      of this city, says it “is mighty cold.” (See also on the low temperature
      of the place, Tournefort, <cite>Voyage du Levant</cite>, II. pp. 258–259.) Arzizi,
      <span class="smcap">Arjish</span>, in the vilayet of Van, was destroyed in the middle of the 19th
      century; it was situated on the road from Van to Erzrum. Arjish Kalá was
      one of the ancient capitals of the Kingdom of Armenia; it was conquered by
      Toghrul I., who made it his residence. (Cf. Vital Cuinet, <cite>Turquie d’Asie</cite>,
      II. p. 710).—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Arjish is the ancient <em>Arsissa</em>, which gave the Lake Van one of its names.
      It is now little more than a decayed castle, with a village inside.</p>

    <p>Notices of Kuniyah, Kaisariya, Sivas, Arzan-ar-Rumi, Arzangan, and Arjish,

    <p><a id="Note_III13" href="#NoteAnchor_III13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Paipurth, or Baiburt, on the high road between Trebizond and
      Erzrum, was, according to Neumann, an Armenian fortress in the first
      century, and, according to Ritter, the castle <em>Baiberdon</em> was fortified by
      Justinian. It stands on a peninsular hill, encircled by the windings of the
      R. Charok. [According to Ramusio’s version Baiburt was the third relay from
      Trebizund to Tauris, and travellers on their way from one of these cities
      to the other passed under this stronghold.—H.&nbsp;C.] The Russians, in retiring
      from it in 1829, blew up the greater part of the defences. The nearest
      silver mines of which we find modern notice, are those of <em>Gumish-Khánah</em>
      (“Silverhouse”), about 35 miles N.W. of Baiburt; they are more correctly
      mines of lead rich in silver, and were once largely worked. But the
      <em>Masálak-al-absár</em> (14th century), besides these, speaks of two others
      in the same province, one of which was near <em>Bajert</em>. This Quatremère
      reasonably would read <em>Babert</em> or Baiburt. (<cite>Not. et Extraits</cite>, XIII. i.

    <p>Ararat (16,953 feet) was ascended, first by Prof. Parrot, September 1829;
      by Spasski Aotonomoff, August 1834; by Behrens, 1835; by Abich, 1845; by
      Seymour in 1848; by Khodzko, Khanikoff, and others, for trigonometrical
      and other scientific purposes, in August 1850. It is characteristic of the
      account from which I take these notes (<cite>Longrimoff</cite>, in <cite>Bull. Soc. Géog.
      Paris</cite>, sér. IV. tom. i. p. 54), that whilst the writer’s countrymen,
      Spasski and Behrens, were “moved by a noble curiosity,” the Englishman is
      only admitted to have “gratified a tourist’s whim”!</p>

    <p><a id="Note_III15" href="#NoteAnchor_III15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—Though Mr. Khanikoff points out that springs of naphtha are
      abundant in the vicinity of Tiflis, the mention of <em>ship-loads</em> (in Ramusio
      indeed altered, but probably by the Editor, to <em>camel-loads</em>), and the vast
      quantities spoken of, point to the naphtha-wells of the Baku Peninsula
      on the Caspian. Ricold speaks of their supplying the whole country as
      far as Baghdad, and Barbaro alludes to the practice of anointing camels
      with the oil. The quantity collected from the springs about Baku was in
      1819 estimated at 241,000 <em>poods</em> (nearly 4000 tons), the greater part of
      which went to Persia. (<cite>Pereg. Quat.</cite> p. 122; <cite>Ramusio</cite>, II. 109; <cite>El. de

    <p>[The phenomenal rise in the production of the Baku oil-fields between
      1890–1900, may be seen at a glance from the Official Statistics where the
      total output for 1900 is given as 601,000,000 poods, about 9,500,000 tons.

    leagues, and a handful of people might hold it against all the world.
    Alexander caused a very strong tower to be built there, to prevent the

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_IV11" href="#NoteAnchor_IV11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Ramusio has: “One part of the said province is subject to the
      Tartar, and the other part, owing to its fortresses, remains subject
      to the King David.” We give an illustration of one of these mediæval
      Georgian fortresses, from a curious collection of MS. notices and drawings
      of Georgian subjects in the Municipal Library at Palermo, executed by
      a certain P. Cristoforo di Castelli of that city, who was a Theatine
      missionary in Georgia, in the first half of the 17th century.</p>

    <p>The G.&nbsp;T. says the King was <em>always</em> called David. The Georgian Kings of
      the family of Bagratidae claimed descent from King David through a prince
      Shampath, said to have been sent north by Nebuchadnezzar; a descent which
      was usually asserted in their public documents. Timur in his Institutes
      mentions a suit of armour given him by the King of Georgia as forged by
      the hand of the Psalmist King. David is a very frequent name in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>their
      royal lists. [The dynasty of the Bagratidae, which was founded in 786 by
      Ashod, and lasted until the annexation of Georgia by Russia on the 18th
      January, 1801, had nine reigning princes named David. During the second
      half of the 12th century the princes were: Dawith (David) IV. Narin
      (1247–1259), Dawith V. (1243–1272), Dimitri II. Thawdadebuli (1272–1289),
      Wakhtang II. (1289–1292), Dawith VI. (1292–1308).—H.&nbsp;C.] There were two
      princes of that name, David, who shared Georgia between them under the
      decision of the Great Kaan in 1246, and one of them, who survived to
      1269, is probably meant here. The name of David was borne by the last
      titular King of Georgia, who ceded his rights to Russia in 1801. It is
      probable, however, as Marsden has suggested, that the statement about
      the King <em>always</em> being called David arose in part out of some confusion
      with the title of <em>Dadian</em>, which, according to Chardin (and also to P.
      di Castelli), was always assumed by the Princes of Mingrelia, or Colchis
      as the latter calls it. Chardin refers this title to the Persian <em>Dád</em>,
      “equity.” To a portrait of “Alexander, King of Iberia,” or Georgia Proper,
      Castelli attaches the following inscription, giving apparently his official
      style: “With the sceptre of David, Crowned by Heaven, First King of the
      Orient and of the World, King of Israel,” adding, “They say that he has
      on his shoulder a small mark of a cross, ‘<i lang="la">Factus est principatus super
      humerum ejus</i>,’ and they add that he has all his ribs in one piece, and not
      divided.” In another place he notes that when attending the King in illness
      his curiosity moved him strongly to ask if these things were true, but he
      thought better of it! (<cite>Khanikoff; Jour. As.</cite> IX. 370, XI. 291, etc.; <cite>Tim.
      Instit.</cite> p. 143; <cite>Castelli</cite> MSS.)</p>

    <p>[A descendant of these Princes was in St. Petersburg about 1870. He wore
      the Russian uniform, and bore the title of Prince Bagration-Mukransky.]</p>

      in the East <em>Sadd-i-Iskandar</em>, the Rampart of Alexander. Bayer thinks the
      wall was probably built originally by one of the Antiochi, and renewed by
      the Sassanian Kobad or his son Naoshirwan. It is ascribed to the latter by
      Abulfeda; and according to Klaproth’s extracts from the <em>Derbend Námah</em>,
      Naoshirwan completed the fortress of Derbend in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 542, whilst he and
      his father together had erected 360 towers upon the Caucasian Wall which
      extended to the Gate of the Alans (<i>i.e.</i> the Pass of Dariel). Mas’udi says
      that the wall extended for 40 parasangs over the steepest summits and
      deepest gorges. The Russians must have gained some knowledge as to the
      actual existence and extent of the remains of this great work, but I have
      not been able to meet with any modern information of a very precise kind.
      According to a quotation from <em>Reinegg’s Kaukasus</em> (I. 120, a work which
      I have not been able to consult), the remains of defences can be traced
      for many miles, and are in some places as much as 120 feet high. M. Moynet
      indeed, in the <cite>Tour du Monde</cite> (I. 122), states that he traced the wall to
      a distance of 27 versts (18 miles) from Derbend, but unfortunately, instead
      of describing remains of such high interest from his own observation, he
      cites a description written by Alex. Dumas, which he says is quite accurate.</p>

    <p>[“To the west of Narin-Kaleh, a fortress which from the top of a promontory
      rises above the city, the wall, strengthened from distance to distance
      by large towers, follows the ridge of the mountains, descends into the
      ravines, and ascends the slopes to take root on some remote peak. If the
      natives were to be believed, this wall, which, however, no longer has
      any strategetical importance, had formerly its towers bristling upon the
      Caucasus chain from one sea to another; at least, this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>rampart did protect
      all the plains at the foot of the eastern Caucasus, since vestiges were
      found up to 30 kilometres from Derbend.” (<cite>Reclus, Asie russe</cite>, p. 160.)
      It has belonged to Russia since 1813. The first European traveller who
      mentions it is Benjamin of Tudela.</p>

    <p>Bretschneider (II. p. 117) observes: “Yule complains that he was not able
      to find any modern information regarding the famous Caucasian Wall which
      begins at Derbend. I may therefore observe that interesting details on the
      subject are found in Legkobytov’s <cite>Survey of the Russian Dominions beyond
      the Caucasus</cite> (in Russian), 1836, vol. iv. pp. 158–161, and in Dubois de
      Montpéreux’s <cite>Voyage autour du Caucase</cite>, 1840, vol. iv. pp. 291–298, from
      which I shall give here an abstract.”</p>

    <p>(He then proceeds to give an abstract, of which the following is a part:)</p>

    <p>“The famous <em>Dagh bary</em> (mountain wall) now begins at the village of
      <em>Djelgan</em>, 4 versts south-west of Derbend, but we know that as late as the
      beginning of the last century it could be traced down to the southern
      gate of the city. This ancient wall then stretches westward to the high
      mountains of Tabasseran (it seems the Tabarestan of Mas’udi).... Dubois
      de Montpéreux enumerates the following sites of remains of the wall:—In
      the famous defile of <em>Dariel</em>, north-east of Kazbek. In the valley of
      the <em>Assai</em> river, near Wapila, about 35 versts north-east of Dariel.
      In the valley of the Kizil river, about 15 versts north-west of Kazbek.
      Farther west, in the valley of the <em>Fiag</em> or <em>Pog</em> river, between <em>Lacz</em>
      and <em>Khilak</em>. From this place farther west about 25 versts, in the valley
      of the <em>Arredon</em> river, in the district of <em>Valaghir</em>. Finally, the
      westernmost section of the Caucasian Wall has been preserved, which was
      evidently intended to shut up the maritime defile of <em>Gagry</em>, on the Black
      Sea.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>There is another wall claiming the title of <em>Sadd-i-Iskandar</em> at the S.E.
      angle of the Caspian. This has been particularly spoken of by Vámbéry, who
      followed its traces from S.W. to N.E. for upwards of 40 miles. (See his
      <cite>Travels in C. Asia</cite>, 54 <i>seqq.</i>, and <cite>Julius Braun</cite> in the <cite>Ausland</cite>, No.
      22, of 1869.)</p>

    <p>Yule (II. pp. 537–538) says, “To the same friendly correspondent [Professor
      Braun] I owe the following additional particulars on this interesting
      subject, extracted from <cite>Eichwald, Periplus des Kasp. M.</cite> I. 128.</p>

    <p>“‘At the point on the mountain, at the extremity of the fortress (of
      Derbend), where the double wall terminates, there begins a single wall
      constructed in the same style, only this no longer runs in a straight
      line, but accommodates itself to the contour of the hill, turning now
      to the north and now to the south. At first it is quite destroyed, and
      showed the most scanty vestiges, a few small heaps of stones or traces of
      towers, but all extending in a general bearing from east to west.... It is
      not till you get 4 versts from Derbend, in traversing the mountains, that
      you come upon a continuous wall. Thenceforward you can follow it over the
      successive ridges ... and through several villages chiefly occupied by the
      Tartar hill-people. The wall ... makes many windings, and every ¾ verst
      it exhibits substantial towers like those of the city-wall, crested with
      loop-holes. Some of these are still in tolerably good condition; others
      have fallen, and with the wall itself have left but slight vestiges.’</p>

    <p>“Eichwald altogether followed it up about 18 versts (12 miles) not
      venturing to proceed further. In later days this cannot have been
      difficult, but my kind correspondent had not been able to lay his hand on
      information.</p>

    <p>“A letter from Mr. Eugene Schuyler communicates some notes regarding
      inscriptions that have been found at and near Derbend, embracing Cufic of
      <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 465, Pehlvi, and even Cuneiform. Alluding to the fact that the other
      <em>Iron-gate</em>, south of Shahrsabz, was called also <em>Kalugah</em>, or <em>Kohlugah</em>
      he adds: ‘I don’t know what that means, nor do I know if the Russian
      Kaluga, south-west of Moscow, has anything to do with it, but I am told
      there is a Russian popular song, of which two lines run:</p>

    <p>“I may observe that I have seen it lately pointed out that <em>Koluga</em> is a
      Mongol word signifying a <em>barrier</em>; and I see that Timkowski (I. 288) gives
      the same explanation of <em>Kalgan</em>, the name applied by Mongols and Russians
      to the gate in the Great Wall, called Chang-kia-Kau by the Chinese, leading
      to Kiakhta.”</p>

    <p>The story alluded to by Polo is found in the mediæval romances of
      Alexander, and in the Pseudo-Callisthenes on which they are founded. The
      hero chases a number of impure cannibal nations within a mountain barrier,
      and prays that they may be shut up therein. The mountains draw together
      within a few cubits, and Alexander then builds up the gorge and closes it
      with gates of brass or iron. There were in all twenty-two nations with
      their kings, and the names of the nations were Gōth, Magōth, Anugi, Egēs,
      Exenach, etc. Godfrey of Viterbo speaks of them in his rhyming verses:—</p>

    <p>Among the questions that the Jews are said to have put, in order to test
      Mahommed’s prophetic character, was one series: “Who are Gog and Magog?
      Where do they dwell? What sort of rampart did Zu’lḳarnain build between
      them and men?” And in the Koran we find (ch. xviii. <cite>The Cavern</cite>): “They
      will question thee, O Mahommed, regarding Zu’lḳarnain. Reply: I will
      tell you his history”—and then follows the story of the erection of the
      Rampart of Yájúj and Májúj. In ch. xxi. again there is an allusion to their
      expected issue at the latter day. This last expectation was one of very
      old date. Thus the Cosmography of Aethicus, a work long believed (though
      erroneously) to have been abridged by St. Jerome, and therefore to be
      as old at least as the 4th century, says that the <i>Turks</i> of the race of
      Gog and Magog, a polluted nation, eating human flesh and feeding on all
      abominations, never washing, and never using wine, salt, nor wheat, shall
      come forth in the Day of Antichrist from where they lie shut up behind the
      Caspian Gates, and make horrid devastation. No wonder that the irruption of
      the Tartars into Europe, heard of at first with almost as much astonishment
      as such an event would produce now, was connected with this prophetic
      legend!<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Emperor Frederic II., writing to Henry III. of England,
      says of the Tartars: “’Tis said they are descended from the Ten Tribes who
      abandoned the Law of Moses, and worshipped the Golden Calf. They are the
      people whom Alexander Magnus shut up in the Caspian Mountains.”</p>

    <p>According to some chroniclers, the Emperor Heraclius had already let loose
      the Shut-up Nations to aid him against the Persians, but it brought him no
      good, for he was beaten in spite of their aid, and died of grief.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

    <p>The theory that the Tartars were Gog and Magog led to the Rampart of
      Alexander being confounded with the Wall of China (see <i>infra</i>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LIX1">Bk. I. ch.
      lix.</a>), or being relegated to the extreme N.E. of Asia, as we find it in the
      Carta Catalana.</p>

    <p>These legends are referred to by Rabbi Benjamin, Hayton, Rubruquis, Ricold,
      Matthew Paris, and many more. Josephus indeed speaks of the Pass which
      Alexander fortified with gates of steel. But his saying that the King of
      Hyrcania was Lord of this Pass points to the Hyrcanian Gates of Northern
      Persia, or perhaps to the Wall of Gomushtapah, described by Vámbéry.</p>

    <p>Ricold of Montecroce allows two arguments to connect the Tartars with the
      Jews who were shut up by Alexander; one that the Tartars hated the very
      name of Alexander, and could not bear to hear it; the other, that their
      manner of writing was very like the Chaldean, meaning apparently the Syriac
      (<em>anté</em>, p. 29). But he points out that they had no resemblance to Jews,
      and no knowledge of the law.</p>

    <p>Edrisi relates how the Khalif Wathek sent one Salem the Dragoman to explore
      the Rampart of Gog and Magog. His route lay by Tiflis, the Alan country,
      and that of the Bashkirds, to the far north or north-east, and back by
      Samarkand. But the report of what he saw is pure fable.</p>

    <p>In 1857, Dr. Bellew seems to have found the ancient belief in the legend
      still held by Afghan gentlemen at Kandahar.</p>

    <p>At Gelath in Imeretia there still exists one valve of a large iron gate,
      traditionally said to be the relic of a pair brought as a trophy from
      Derbend by David, King of Georgia, called the Restorer (1089–1130). M.
      Brosset, however, has shown it to be the gate of Ganja, carried off in 1139.</p>

      so important an article of Genoese trade, as to give the name of <em>Chao
      de Bux</em> (Cavo di Bussi) to the bay of Bambor, N.W. of Sukum Kala’, where
      the traffic was carried on. (See <cite>Elie de Laprim.</cite> 243.) Abulfeda also
      speaks of the Forest of Box (<em>Shará’ ul-buḳs</em>) on the shores of the Black
      Sea, from which box-wood was exported to all parts of the world; but his
      indication of the exact locality is confused. (<cite>Reinaud’s Abulf.</cite> I. 289.)</p>

    <p>At the present time “Boxwood abounds on the southern coast of the Caspian,
      and large quantities are exported from near Resht to England and Russia. It
      is sent up the Volga to Tsaritzin, from thence by rail to the Don, and down
      that river to the Black Sea, from whence it is shipped to England.” (<cite>MS.

      Armenia,” a term often including Georgia and Caucasus. The name of the bird
      is perhaps the same as <em>’Afçi</em>, “Falco montanus.” (See <cite>Casiri</cite>, I. 320.)
      Major St. John tells me that the <em>Terlán</em>, or goshawk, much used in Persia,
      is still generally brought from Caucasus. (<cite>Cardan, de Rer. Varietate</cite>, VII. 35.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_IV16" href="#NoteAnchor_IV16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—A letter of Warren Hastings, written shortly before his death, and
      after reading Marsden’s Marco Polo, tells how a fish-breeder of Banbury
      warned him against putting pike into his fish-pond, saying, “If you should
      leave them where they are <em>till Shrove Tuesday</em> they will be sure to spawn,
      and then you will never get any other fish to breed in it.” (<cite>Romance of
      Travel</cite>, I. 255.) Edward Webbe in his Travels (1590, reprinted 1868) tells
      us that in the “Land of Siria there is a River having great store of fish
      like unto Salmon-trouts, but no Jew can catch them, though either Christian
      and Turk shall catch them in abundance with great ease.” The circumstance
      of fish being got only for a limited time in spring is noticed with
      reference to Lake Van both by Tavernier and Mr. Brant.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span></p>

    <p>But the exact legend here reported is related (as M. Pauthier has
      already noticed) by Wilibrand of Oldenburg of a stream under the Castle
      of Adamodana, belonging to the Hospitallers, near Naversa (the ancient
      <em>Anazarbus</em>), in Cilicia under Taurus. And Khanikoff was told the same
      story of a lake in the district of Akhaltziké in Western Georgia, in regard
      to which he explains the substance of the phenomenon as a result of the
      rise of the lake’s level by the melting of the snows, which often coincides
      with Lent. I may add that Moorcroft was told respecting a sacred pond near
      Sir-i-Chashma, on the road from Kabul to Bamian, that the fish in the pond
      were not allowed to be touched, but that they were accustomed to desert it
      for the rivulet that ran through the valley regularly every year <em>on the
      day of the vernal equinox</em>, and it was then lawful to catch them.</p>

    <p>Like circumstances would produce the same effect in a variety of lakes,
      and I have not been able to identify the convent of St. Leonard’s. Indeed
      Leonard (<em>Sant Lienard</em>, G.&nbsp;T.) seems no likely name for an Armenian Saint;
      and the patroness of the convent (as she is of many others in that country)
      was perhaps Saint <em>Nina</em>, an eminent personage in the Armenian Church,
      whose tomb is still a place of pilgrimage; or possibly St. <em>Helena</em>, for I
      see that the Russian maps show a place called <em>Elenovka</em> on the shores of
      Lake Sevan, N.E. of Erivan. Ramusio’s text, moreover, says that the lake
      was <em>four days in compass</em>, and this description will apply, I believe, to
      none but the lake just named. This is, according to Monteith, 47 miles in
      length and 21 miles in breadth, and as far as I can make out he travelled
      round it in three very long marches. Convents and churches on its shores
      are numerous, and a very ancient one occupies an island on the lake. The
      lake is noted for its fish, especially magnificent trout.</p>

    <p>Ramusio has: “In this province there is a fine city called <span class="smcap">Tiflis</span>, and
      round about it are many castles and walled villages. It is inhabited by
      Christians, Armenians, Georgians, and some Saracens and Jews, but not many.”</p>

    <p><a id="Note_IV17" href="#NoteAnchor_IV17" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.</a>—The name assigned by Marco to the Caspian, “Mer de Gheluchelan”
      or “Ghelachelan,” has puzzled commentators. I have no doubt that the
      interpretation adopted above is the correct one. I suppose that Marco said
      that the sea was called “La Mer de Ghel ou (de) Ghelan,” a name taken from
      the districts of the ancient <em>Gelae</em> on its south-western shores, called
      indifferently <em>Gíl</em> or <em>Gílán</em>, just as many other regions of Asia have
      like duplicate titles (singular and plural), arising, I suppose, from the
      change of a <em>gentile</em> into a <em>local</em> name. Such are Lár, Lárán, Khutl,
      Khutlán, etc., a class to which Badakhshán, Wakhán, Shaghnán, Mungán,
      Chaghánián, possibly Bámián, and many others have formerly belonged, as
      the adjectives in some cases surviving, <em>Badakhshi, Shaghni, Wákhi</em>, etc.,
      show.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The change exemplified in the induration of these <em>gentile plurals</em>
      into <em>local singulars</em> is everywhere traced in the passage from earlier to
      later geography. The old Indian geographical lists, such as are preserved
      in the Puránas, and in Pliny’s extracts from Megasthenes, are, in the main,
      lists of <em>peoples</em>, not of provinces, and even where the real name seems to
      be local a <em>gentile</em> form is often given. So also <em>Tochari</em> and <em>Sogdi</em> are
      replaced by <em>Tokháristán</em> and <em>Sughd</em>; the <em>Veneti</em> and <em>Taurini</em> by Venice
      and Turin; the <em>Remi</em> and the <em>Parisii</em>, by Rheims and Paris; <em>East-Saxons</em>
      and <em>South-Saxons</em> by Essex and Sussex; not to mention the countless
      <em>-ings</em> that mark the tribal settlement of the Saxons in Britain.</p>

    <p>Abulfeda, speaking of this territory, uses exactly Polo’s phrase, saying
      that the districts in question are properly called <em>Kíl-o-Kílán</em>, but by
      the Arabs <em>Jíl-o-Jílán</em>. Teixeira gives the Persian name of the sea as
      <em>Darya Ghiláni</em>. (See <cite>Abulf.</cite> in <cite>Büsching</cite>, v. 329.)</p>

    <p>[The province of Gíl (Gílán), which is situated between the mountains and
      the Caspian Sea, and between the provinces of Azerbaíján and Mázanderán (H.&nbsp;C.)],
      gave name to the silk for which it was and is still famous, mentioned
      as <em>Ghelle</em> (<em>Gílí</em>) at the end of this chapter. This <em>Seta Ghella</em> is
      mentioned also by Pegolotti (pp. 212, 238, 301), and by Uzzano, with an odd
      transposition, as Seta <em>Leggi</em>, along with Seta <em>Masandroni</em>, <i>i.e.</i> from the
      adjoining province of Mázanderán (p. 192). May not the Spanish <em>Geliz</em>,
      “a silk-dealer,” which seems to have been a puzzle to etymologists, be
      connected with this? (See <cite>Dozy and Engelmann</cite>, 2nd ed. p. 275.) [Prof. F.
      de Filippi (<cite>Viaggo in Persia nel</cite> 1862, ... Milan, 1865, 8vo) speaks of

    <p>The dimensions assigned to the Caspian in the text would be very correct
      if length were meant, but the Geog. Text with the same figure specifies
      <em>circuit</em> (<em>zire</em>). Ramusio again has “a circuit of 2800 miles.” Possibly
      the original reading was 2700; but this would be in excess.</p>

    <p>We have little information as to the Genoese navigation of the Caspian,

      See also <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 50, where an account is given of a remarkable
      enterprise by Genoese buccaneers on the Caspian about that time. Mas’udi
      relates an earlier history of how about the beginning of the 9th century
      a fleet of 500 Russian vessels came out of the Volga, and ravaged all the
      populous southern and western shores of the Caspian. The unhappy population
      was struck with astonishment and horror at this unlooked-for visitation
      from a sea that had hitherto been only frequented by peaceful traders or
      fishermen. (II. 18–24.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Kingdom of Mausul.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the frontier of Armenia towards the south-east is
    the kingdom of <span class="smcap">Mausul</span>.
    It is a very great kingdom, and inhabited<a id="NoteAnchor_V11" href="#Note_V11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> by several different
    kinds of people whom we shall now describe.</p>

  <p>First there is a kind of people called <span class="smcap">Arabi</span>, and these worship Mahommet.
    Then there is another description of people who are <span class="smcap">Nestorian</span> and <span class="smcap">Jacobite</span>
    Christians. These have a Patriarch, whom they call the <span class="smcap">Jatolic</span>, and this
    Patriarch creates Archbishops, and Abbots, and Prelates of all other
    degrees, and sends them into every quarter, as to India, to Baudas, or
    to Cathay, just as the Pope of Rome does in the Latin countries. For you
    must know that though there is a very great number of Christians in those
    countries, they are all Jacobites and Nestorians; Christians indeed, but
    not in the fashion enjoined by the Pope of Rome, for they come short in
    several points of the Faith.<a id="NoteAnchor_V12" href="#Note_V12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>All the cloths of gold and silk that are called <em>Mosolins</em> are made in this
    country; and those great Merchants called <em>Mosolins</em>, who carry for sale
    such quantities of spicery and pearls and cloths of silk and gold, are also
    from this kingdom.<a id="NoteAnchor_V13" href="#Note_V13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>There is yet another race of people who inhabit the mountains in that
    quarter, and are called <span class="smcap">Curds</span>. Some of them are Christians, and some of
    them are Saracens; but they are an evil generation, whose delight it is to
    plunder merchants.<a id="NoteAnchor_V14" href="#Note_V14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>[Near this province is another called <span class="smcap">Mus</span> and <span class="smcap">Merdin</span>, producing an immense
    quantity of cotton, from which they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>make a great deal of buckram<a id="NoteAnchor_V15" href="#Note_V15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a>
    and other cloth. The people are craftsmen and traders, and all are subject

      1.</a>—Polo could scarcely have been justified in calling <span class="smcap">Mosul</span> a very
      great kingdom. This is a bad habit of his, as we shall have to notice
      again. Badruddín Lúlú, the last Atabeg of Mosul of the race of Zenghi had
      at the age of 96 taken sides with Hulaku, and stood high in his favour.
      His son Malik Sálih, having revolted, surrendered to the Mongols in 1261
      on promise of life; which promise they kept in Mongol fashion by torturing
      him to death. Since then the kingdom had ceased to exist as such. Coins
      of Badruddín remain with the name and titles of Mangku Kaan on their
      reverse, and some of his and of other atabegs exhibit curious imitations
      of Greek art. (<cite>Quat. Rash.</cite> p. 389; <cite>Jour. As.</cite> IV. VI. 141.).—H.&nbsp;Y. and
      H.&nbsp;C. [Mosul was pillaged by Timur at the end of the 14th century; during
      the 15th it fell into the hands of the Turkomans, and during the 16th, of
      Ismail, Shah of Persia.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[The population of Mosul is to-day 61,000 inhabitants—(48,000 Musulmans,
      10,000 Christians belonging to various churches, and 3000 Jews).—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_V12" href="#NoteAnchor_V12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—The Nestorian Church was at this time and in the preceding
      centuries diffused over Asia to an extent of which little conception is
      generally entertained, having a chain of Bishops and Metropolitans from
      Jerusalem to Peking. The Church derived its name from Nestorius, Patriarch
      of Constantinople, who was deposed by the Council of Ephesus in 431. The
      chief “point of the Faith” wherein it came short, was (at least in its
      most tangible form) the doctrine that in Our Lord there were two Persons,
      one of the Divine Word, the other of the Man Jesus; the former dwelling in
      the latter as in a Temple, or uniting with the latter “as fire with iron.”
      <em>Nestorin</em>, the term used by Polo, is almost a literal transcript of the
      Arab form <em>Nastúri</em>. A notice of the Metropolitan sees, with a map, will be
      found in <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. ccxliv.</p>

    <p><em>Játhalík</em>, written in our text (from G.&nbsp;T.) <em>Jatolic</em>, by Fr. Burchard
      and Ricold <em>Jaselic</em>, stands for <span lang="el">Καθολικóς</span>. No doubt it was
      originally <em>Gáthalík</em>, but altered in pronunciation by the Arabs. The term
      was applied by Nestorians to their Patriarch; among the Jacobites to the
      <em>Mafrián</em> or Metropolitan. The Nestorian Patriarch at this time resided at
      Baghdad. (<cite>Assemani</cite>, vol. iii. pt. 2; <cite>Per. Quat.</cite> 91, 127.)</p>

    <p>The Jacobites, or Jacobins, as they are called by writers of that age (Ar.
      <em>Ya’úbkíy</em>), received their name from Jacob Baradaeus or James Zanzale,
      Bishop of Edessa (so called, Mas’udi says, because he was a maker of
      <em>barda’at</em> or saddle-cloths), who gave a great impulse to their doctrine in
      the 6th century. [At some time between the years 541 and 578, he separated
      from the Church and became a follower of the doctrine of Eutyches.—H.&nbsp;C.]
      The Jacobites then formed an independent Church, which at one time spread
      over the East at least as far as Sístán, where they had a see under the
      Sassanian Kings. Their distinguishing tenet was <em>Monophysitism</em>, viz., that
      Our Lord had but one Nature, the Divine. It was in fact a rebound from
      Nestorian doctrine, but, as might be expected in such a case, there was a
      vast number of shades of opinion among both bodies. The chief locality of
      the Jacobites was in the districts of Mosul, Tekrit, and Jazírah, and their
      Patriarch was at this time settled at the Monastery of St. Matthew, near
      Mosul, but afterwards, and to the present day, at or near Mardin. [They
      have at present two patriarchates: the Monastery of Zapharan near Baghdad
      and Etchmiadzin.—H.&nbsp;C.] The Armenian, Coptic, Abyssinian, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>and Malabar
      Churches all hold some shade of the Jacobite doctrine, though the first two
      at least have Patriarchs apart.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_V13" href="#NoteAnchor_V13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—We see here that <em>mosolin</em> or <em>muslin</em> had a very different meaning
      from what it has now. A quotation from Ives by Marsden shows it to have
      been applied in the middle of last century to a strong cotton cloth made at
      Mosul. Dozy says the Arabs use <em>Mauçili</em> in the sense of muslin, and refers
      to passages in ‘The Arabian Nights.’ [Bretschneider (<cite>Med. Res.</cite> II. p.
      122) observes “that in the narrative of Ch’ang Ch’un’s travels to the west
      in 1221, it is stated that in Samarkand the men of the lower classes and
      the priests wrap their heads about with a piece of white <em>mo-sze</em>. There
      can be no doubt that mo-sze here denotes ‘muslin,’ and the Chinese author
      seems to understand by this term the same material which we are now used to
      call muslin.”—H.&nbsp;C.] I have found no elucidation of Polo’s application of
      <em>mosolini</em> to a class of merchants. But, in a letter of Pope Innocent IV.
      (1244) to the Dominicans in Palestine, we find classed as different bodies
      of Oriental Christians, “<em>Jacobitae, Nestoritae, Georgiani, Graeci, Armeni,
      Maronitae, et</em> Mosolini.” (<cite>Le Quien</cite>, III. 1342.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_V14" href="#NoteAnchor_V14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—“The Curds,” says Ricold, “exceed in malignant ferocity all the
      barbarous nations that I have seen.... They are called <em>Curti</em>, not because
      they are curt in stature, but from the Persian word for <em>Wolves</em>.... They
      have three principal vices, viz., Murder, Robbery, and Treachery.” Some
      say they have not mended since, but his etymology is doubtful. <em>Kúrt</em> is
      Turkish for a wolf, not Persian, which is <em>Gurg</em>; but the name (<em>Karduchi,
      Kordiaei</em>, etc.) is older, I imagine, than the Turkish language in that
      part of Asia. Quatremère refers it to the Persian <em>gurd</em>, “strong, valiant,
      hero.” As regards the statement that some of the Kurds were Christians,
      Mas’udi states that the Jacobites and certain other Christians in the
      territory of Mosul and Mount Judi were reckoned among the Kurds. (<cite>Not. et
      Ext.</cite> XIII. i. 304.) [The Kurds of Mosul are in part nomadic and are called
      <em>Kotcheres</em>, but the greater number are sedentary and cultivate cereals,
      cotton, tobacco, and fruits. (<em>Cuinet.</em>) Old Kurdistan had Shehrizor
      (Kerkuk, in the sanjak of that name) as its capital.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_V15" href="#NoteAnchor_V15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—Ramusio here, as in all passages where other texts have <em>Bucherami</em>
      and the like, puts <em>Boccassini</em>, a word which has become obsolete in its
      turn. I see both <em>Bochayrani</em> and <em>Bochasini</em> coupled, in a Genoese fiscal
      statute of 1339, quoted by Pardessus. (<cite>Lois Maritimes</cite>, IV. 456.)</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Mush</span> and <span class="smcap">Mardin</span> are in very different regions, but as their actual interval
      is only about 120 miles, they <em>may</em> have been under one provincial
      government. Mush is essentially Armenian, and, though the seat of a
      Pashalik, is now a wretched place. Mardin, on the verge of the Mesopotamian
      Plain, rises in terraces on a lofty hill, and there, says Hammer, “Sunnis
      and Shias, Catholic and Schismatic Armenians, Jacobites, Nestorians,
      Chaldæans, Sun-, Fire-, Calf-, and Devil-worshippers dwell one over the
      head of the other.” (<cite>Ilchan.</cite> I. 191.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the great City of Baudas, and how it was taken.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Baudas</span> is a great city, which used to be the seat of the Calif of all the
    Saracens in the world, just as Rome is the seat of the Pope of all the
    Christians.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI11" href="#Note_VI11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> A very great river flows through the city, and by this
    you can descend to the Sea of India. There is a great traffic of merchants
    with their goods this way; they descend some eighteen days from Baudas,
    and then come to a certain city called <span class="smcap">Kisi</span>, where they enter the Sea of
    India.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI12" href="#Note_VI12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> There is also on the river, as you go from Baudas to Kisi, a
    great city called <span class="smcap">Bastra</span>, surrounded by woods, in which grow the best dates
    in the world.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI13" href="#Note_VI13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>In Baudas they weave many different kinds of silk stuffs and gold brocades,
    such as <em>nasich</em>, and <em>nac</em>, and <em>cramoisy</em>, and many another beautiful
    tissue richly wrought with figures of beasts and birds. It is the noblest
    and greatest city in all those regions.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI14" href="#Note_VI14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>Now it came to pass on a day in the year of Christ 1255, that the Lord of
    the Tartars of the Levant, whose name was Alaü, brother to the Great Kaan
    now reigning, gathered a mighty host and came up against Baudas and took
    it by storm.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI15" href="#Note_VI15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a> It was a great enterprise! for in Baudas there were
    more than 100,000 horse, besides foot soldiers. And when Alaü had taken the
    place he found therein a tower of the Califs, which was full of gold and
    silver and other treasure; in fact the greatest accumulation of treasure
    in one spot that ever was known.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI16" href="#Note_VI16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a> When he beheld that great heap
    of treasure he was astonished, and, summoning the Calif to his presence,
    he said to him: “Calif, tell me now why thou <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>hast gathered such a huge
    treasure? What didst thou mean to do therewith? Knewest thou not that I
    was thine enemy, and that I was coming against thee with so great an host
    to cast thee forth of thine heritage? Wherefore didst thou not take of thy
    gear and employ it in paying knights and soldiers to defend thee and thy city?”</p>

  <p>The Calif wist not what to answer, and said never a word. So the Prince
    continued, “Now then, Calif, since I see what a love thou hast borne thy
    treasure, I will e’en give it thee to eat!” So he shut the Calif up in the
    Treasure Tower, and bade that neither meat nor drink should be given him,
    saying, “Now, Calif, eat of thy treasure as much as thou wilt, since thou
    art so fond of it; for never shalt thou have aught else to eat!”</p>

  <p>So the Calif lingered in the tower four days, and then died like a dog.
    Truly his treasure would have been of more service to him had he bestowed
    it upon men who would have defended his kingdom and his people, rather
    than let himself be taken and deposed and put to death as he was.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI17" href="#Note_VI17" class="fnanchor">{7}</a>
    Howbeit, since that time, there has been never another Calif, either at
    Baudas or anywhere else.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI18" href="#Note_VI18" class="fnanchor">{8}</a></p>

  <p>Now I will tell you of a great miracle that befell at Baudas, wrought by
    God on behalf of the Christians.</p>

      kingdom of <em>Bao-da</em>,” H.&nbsp;C.], is curiously like that used by the Chinese

      brief as to convey an erroneous impression that the Tigris flows to Kisi,
      whereas three-fourths of the length of the Persian Gulf intervene between
      the river mouth and Kisi. The latter is the island and city of <span class="smcap">Kish</span> or
      <span class="smcap">Kais</span>, about 200 miles from the mouth of the Gulf, and for a long time
      one of the chief ports of trade with India and the East. The island, the
      <em>Cataea</em> of Arrian, now called Ghes or Kenn, is singular among the islands
      of the Gulf as being wooded and well supplied with fresh water. The ruins
      of a city [called Harira, according to Lord Curzon,] exist on the north
      side. According to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>Wassáf, the island derived its name from one Kais, the
      son of a poor widow of Síráf (then a great port of Indian trade on the
      northern shore of the Gulf), who on a voyage to India, about the 10th
      century, made a fortune precisely as Dick Whittington did. The proceeds of
      the cat were invested in an establishment on this island. Modern attempts
      to nationalise Whittington may surely be given up! It is one of the tales
      which, like Tell’s shot, the dog Gellert, and many others, are common to
      many regions. (<cite>Hammer’s Ilch.</cite> I. 239; <cite>Ouseley’s Travels</cite>, I. 170; <cite>Notes

    <p>Mr. Badger, in a postscript to his translation of the History of Omán
      (<cite>Hak. Soc.</cite> 1871), maintains that Kish or Kais was at this time a city
      on the mainland, and identical from Síráf. He refers to Ibn Batuta (II.
      244), who certainly does speak of visiting “the city of Kais, called also
      Síráf.” And Polo, neither here nor in Bk. III. ch. xl., speaks of Kisi as
      an island. I am inclined, however, to think that this was from not having
      visited it. Ibn Batuta says nothing of Síráf as a seat of trade; but the
      historian Wassáf, who had been in the service of Jamáluddín al-Thaibi, the
      Lord of Kais, in speaking of the export of horses thence to India, calls
      it “the <em>Island</em> of Kais.” (Elliot, III. 34.) Compare allusions to this
      horse trade in ch. xv. and in Bk. III. ch. xvii. Wassáf was precisely a
      contemporary of Polo.</p>

      From their use in the state canopies and umbrellas of Italian dignitaries,
      the word <em>Baldacchino</em> has come to mean a canopy, even when architectural.
      [<em>Baldekino, baldacchino</em>, was at first entirely made of silk, but
      afterwards silk was mixed (<i lang="la">sericum mixtum</i>) with cotton or thread. When
      Hulaku conquered Baghdad part of the tribute was to be paid with that kind
      of stuff. Later on, says Heyd (II. p. 697), it was also manufactured in
      the province of Ahwaz, at Damas and at Cyprus; it was carried as far as
      France and England. Among the articles sent from Baghdad to Okkodai Khan,
      mentioned in the <cite>Yüan ch’ao pi shi</cite> (made in the 14th century), quoted
      by Bretschneider (<cite>Med. Res.</cite> II. p. 124), we note: <em>Nakhut</em> (a kind of
      gold brocade), <em>Nachidut</em> (a silk stuff interwoven with gold), <em>Dardas</em>
      (a stuff embroidered in gold). Bretschneider (p. 125) adds: “With respect
      to <em>nakhut</em> and <em>nachidut</em>, I may observe that these words represent the
      Mongol plural form of <em>nakh</em> and <em>nachetti</em>.... I may finally mention
      that in the <cite>Yüan shi</cite>, ch. lxxviii. (on official dresses), a stuff,
      <em>na-shi-shi</em>, is repeatedly named, and the term is explained there by
      <em>kin kin</em> (gold brocade).”—H.&nbsp;C.] The stuffs called <em>Nasich</em> and <em>Nac</em>
      are again mentioned by our traveller below (<a href="#CHAPTER_LIX1">ch. lix.</a>). We only know that
      they were of silk and gold, as he implies here, and as Ibn Batuta tells
      us, who mentions <em>Nakh</em> several times and <em>Nasíj</em> once. The latter is also
      mentioned by Rubruquis (<em>Nasic</em>) as a present made to him at the Kaan’s
      court. And Pegolotti speaks of both <em>nacchi</em> and <em>nacchetti</em> of silk and
      gold, the latter apparently answering to <em>Nasich</em>. <em>Nac, Nacques, Nachiz,
      Nacíz, Nasís</em>, appear in accounts and inventories of the 14th century,
      French and English. (See <cite>Dictionnaire des Tissus</cite>, II. 199, and <cite>Douet d’Arcq,
      Comptes de l’Argenterie des Rois de France</cite>, etc., 334.) We find no
      mention of <em>Nakh</em> or <em>Nasíj</em> among the stuffs detailed in the <cite>Aín Akbari</cite>,
      so they must have been obsolete in the 16th century. [Cf. Heyd, <cite>Com.
      du Levant</cite>, II. p. 698; <em>Nacco</em>, nachetto, comes from the Arabic <em>nakh</em>
      (<em>nekh</em>); <em>nassit</em> (<em>nasith</em>) from the Arabic <em>nécidj</em>.—H.&nbsp;C.] <em>Quermesis</em>
      or Cramoisy derived its name from the Kermes insect (Ar. <em>Kirmiz</em>) found on
      <i>Quercus coccifera</i>, now supplanted by cochineal. The stuff so called is
      believed to have been originally a crimson velvet, but apparently, like the
      mediæval <em>Purpura</em>, if not identical with it, it came to indicate a tissue
      rather than a colour. Thus Fr.-Michel quotes velvet of vermeil cramoisy,
      of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>violet, and of blue cramoisy, and <em>pourpres</em> of a variety of colours,
      though he says he has never met with <em>pourpre blanche</em>. I may, however,
      point to Plano Carpini (p. 755), who describes the courtiers at Karakorum
      as clad in white <em>purpura</em>.</p>

    <p>The London prices of <em>Chermisi</em> and <em>Baldacchini</em> in the early part of the
      15th century will be found in Uzzano’s work, but they are hard to elucidate.</p>

    <p>Babylon, of which Baghdad was the representative, was famous for its
      variegated textures in very early days. We do not know the nature of the
      goodly Babylonish garment which tempted Achan in Jericho, but Josephus
      speaks of the affluence of rich stuffs carried in the triumph of Titus,
      “gorgeous with life-like designs from the Babylonian loom,” and he also
      describes the memorable Veil of the Temple as a <span lang="el">πέπλος Βαβυλώνιος</span>
      of varied colours marvellously wrought. Pliny says King Attalus invented
      the intertexture of cloth with gold; but the weaving of damasks of a
      variety of colours was perfected at Babylon, and thence they were called
      Babylonian.</p>

    <p>The brocades wrought with figures of animals in gold, of which Marco
      speaks, are still a <i lang="fr">spécialité</i> at Benares, where they are known by the
      name of <em>Shikárgáh</em> or hunting-grounds, which is nearly a translation of
      the name <em>Thard-wahsh</em> “beast-hunts,” by which they were known to the
      mediæval Saracens. (See <cite>Q. Makrizi</cite>, IV. 69–70.) Plautus speaks of such
      patterns in carpets, the produce of Alexandria—“<em>Alexandrina</em> belluata
      <em>conchyliata tapetia</em>.” Athenaeus speaks of Persian carpets of like
      description at an extravagant entertainment given by Antiochus Epiphanes;
      and the same author cites a banquet given in Persia by Alexander, at which
      there figured costly curtains embroidered with animals. In the 4th century
      Asterius, Bishop of Amasia in Pontus, rebukes the Christians who indulge in
      such attire: “You find upon them lions, panthers, bears, huntsmen, woods,
      and rocks; whilst the more devout display Christ and His disciples, with
      the stories of His miracles,” etc. And Sidonius alludes to upholstery of
      like character:</p>

    <p>The story of the death of Mosta’sim Billah, the last of the Abbaside
      Khalifs, is told in much the same way by Hayton, Ricold, Pachymeres, and
      Joinville. The memory of the last glorious old man must have failed him,
      when he says the facts were related by some merchants who came to King
      Lewis, when before Saiette (or Sidon), viz. in 1253, for the capture of
      Baghdad occurred five years later. Mar. Sanuto says melted gold was poured
      down the Khalif’s throat—a transfer, no doubt, from the old story of
      Crassus and the Parthians. Contemporary Armenian historians assert that
      Hulaku slew him with his own hand.</p>

    <p>All that Rashiduddin says is: “The evening of Wednesday, the 14th of Safar,
      656 (20th February, 1258), the Khalif was put to death in the village of
      Wakf, with his eldest son and five eunuchs who had never quitted him.”
      Later writers say that he was wrapt in a carpet and trodden to death by horses.</p>

    <p>[Cf. <cite>The Story of the Death of the last Abbaside Caliph, from the Vatican
      MS. of Ibn-al-Furāt</cite>, by G. le Strange (<cite>Jour. R. As. Soc.</cite>, April,
      1900, pp. 293–300). This is the story of the death of the Khalif told by
      Ibn-al-Furāt (born in Cairo, 1335 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>):</p>

    <p>“Then Hūlagū gave command, and the Caliph was left a-hungering, until his
      case was that of very great hunger, so that he called asking that somewhat
      might be given him to eat. And the accursed Hūlagū sent for a dish with
      gold therein, and a dish with silver therein, and a dish with gems, and
      ordered these all to be set before the Caliph al Musta’sim, saying to him,
      ‘Eat these.’ But the Caliph made answer, ‘These be not fit for eating.’
      Then said Hūlagū: ‘Since thou didst so well know that these be not fit
      for eating, why didst thou make a store thereof? With part thereof thou
      mightest have sent gifts to propitiate us, and with part thou shouldst have
      raised an army to serve thee and defend thyself against us! And Hūlagū
      commanded them to take forth the Caliph and his son to a place without
      the camp, and they were here bound and put into two great sacks, being
      afterwards trampled under foot till they both died—the mercy of Allah be
      upon them.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The foundation of the story, so widely received among the Christians, is
      to be found also in the narrative of Nikbi (and Mirkhond), which is cited
      by D’Ohsson. When the Khalif surrendered, Hulaku put before him a plateful
      of gold, and told him to eat it. “But one does not eat gold,” said the
      prisoner. “Why, then,” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>replied the Tartar, “did you hoard it, instead of
      expending it in keeping up an army? Why did you not meet me at the Oxus?”
      The Khalif could only say, “Such was God’s will!” “And that which has
      befallen you was also God’s will,” said Hulaku.</p>

    <p>Wassáf’s narrative is interesting:—“Two days after his capture the Khalif
      was at his morning prayer, and began with the verse (<cite>Koran</cite>, III. 25),
      ‘Say God is the Possessor of Dominion! It shall be given to whom He will;
      it shall be taken from whom He will: whom He will He raiseth to honour;
      whom He will He casteth to the ground.’ Having finished the regular office
      he continued still in prayer with tears and importunity. Bystanders
      reported to the Ilkhan the deep humiliation of the Khalif’s prayers, and
      the text which seemed to have so striking an application to those two
      princes. Regarding what followed there are different stories. Some say that
      the Ilkhan ordered food to be withheld from the Khalif, and that when he
      asked for food the former bade a dish of gold be placed before him, etc.
      Eventually, after taking counsel with his chiefs, the Padishah ordered the
      execution of the Khalif. It was represented that the blood-drinking sword
      ought not to be stained with the gore of Mosta’sim. He was therefore rolled
      in a carpet, just as carpets are usually rolled up, insomuch that his limbs
      were crushed.”</p>

    <p>The avarice of the Khalif was proverbial. When the Mongol army was
      investing Miafaraḳain, the chief, Malik Kamál, told his people that
      everything he had should be at the service of those in need: “Thank God, I
      am not like Mosta’sim, a worshipper of silver and gold!”</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Calif of Baudas took counsel to slay all the Christians in his Land.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I will</span> tell you then this great marvel that occurred between Baudas and
    Mausul.</p>

  <p>It was in the year of Christ<a id="NoteAnchor_VII11" href="#Note_VII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> ... that there was a Calif at Baudas
    who bore a great hatred to Christians, and was taken up day and night with
    the thought how he might either bring those that were in his kingdom over
    to his own faith, or might procure them all to be slain. And he used daily
    to take counsel about this with the devotees and priests of his faith,<a id="NoteAnchor_VII12" href="#Note_VII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    for they all <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>bore the Christians like malice. And, indeed, it is a
    fact, that the whole body of Saracens throughout the world are always most
    malignantly disposed towards the whole body of Christians.</p>

  <p>Now it happened that the Calif, with those shrewd priests of his, got hold
    of that passage in our Gospel which says, that if a Christian had faith as
    a grain of mustard seed, and should bid a mountain be removed, it would be
    removed. And such indeed is the truth. But when they had got hold of this
    text they were delighted, for it seemed to them the very thing whereby
    either to force all the Christians to change their faith, or to bring
    destruction upon them all. The Calif therefore called together all the
    Christians in his territories, who were extremely numerous. And when they
    had come before him, he showed them the Gospel, and made them read the text
    which I have mentioned. And when they had read it he asked them if that was
    the truth? The Christians answered that it assuredly was so. “Well,” said
    the Calif, “since you say that it is the truth, I will give you a choice.
    Among such a number of you there must needs surely be this small amount of
    faith; so you must either move that mountain there,”—and he pointed to a
    mountain in the neighbourhood—“or you shall die an ill death; unless you
    choose to eschew death by all becoming Saracens and adopting our Holy Law.
    To this end I give you a respite of ten days; if the thing be not done by
    that time, ye shall die or become Saracens.” And when he had said this he
    dismissed them, to consider what was to be done in this strait wherein they were.</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Christians were in great dismay because of what the Calif had said.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Christians on hearing what the Calif had said were in great dismay,
    but they lifted all their hopes to God, their Creator, that He would help
    them in this their strait. All the wisest of the Christians took counsel
    together, and among them were a number of bishops and priests, but they
    had no resource except to turn to Him from whom all good things do come,
    beseeching Him to protect them from the cruel hands of the Calif.</p>

  <p>So they were all gathered together in prayer, both men and women, for
    eight days and eight nights. And whilst they were thus engaged in prayer
    it was revealed in a vision by a Holy Angel of Heaven to a certain Bishop
    who was a very good Christian, that he should desire a certain Christian
    Cobler,<a id="NoteAnchor_VIII11" href="#Note_VIII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> who had but one eye, to pray to God; and that God in His
    goodness would grant such prayer because of the Cobler’s holy life.</p>

  <p>Now I must tell you what manner of man this Cobler was. He was one who led
    a life of great uprightness and chastity, and who fasted and kept from all
    sin, and went daily to church to hear Mass, and gave daily a portion of
    his gains to God. And the way how he came to have but one eye was this. It
    happened one day that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>a certain woman came to him to have a pair of shoes
    made, and she showed him her foot that he might take her measure. Now she
    had a very beautiful foot and leg; and the Cobler in taking her measure
    was conscious of sinful thoughts. And he had often heard it said in the
    Holy Evangel, that if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast it from
    thee, rather than sin. So, as soon as the woman had departed, he took the
    awl that he used in stitching, and drove it into his eye and destroyed it.
    And this is the way he came to lose his eye. So you can judge what a holy,
    just, and righteous man he was.</p>

    and heard the Holy Mass. And after Mass had been sung, they all went forth
    together in a great procession to the plain in front of the mountain,
    carrying the precious cross before them, loudly singing and greatly weeping
    as they went. And when they arrived at the spot, there they found the Calif
    with all his Saracen host armed to slay them if they would not change their
    faith; for the Saracens believed not in the least that God would grant
    such favour to the Christians. These latter stood indeed in great fear and
    doubt, but nevertheless they rested their hope on their God Jesus Christ.</p>

  <p>So the Cobler received the Bishop’s benison, and then threw himself on his
    knees before the Holy Cross, and stretched out his hands towards Heaven,
    and made this prayer: “Blessed <span class="smcap">Lord God Almighty</span>, I pray Thee by Thy
    goodness that Thou wilt grant this grace unto Thy people, insomuch that
    they perish not, nor Thy faith be cast down, nor abused nor flouted. Not
    that I am in the least worthy to prefer such request unto Thee; but for
    Thy great power and mercy I beseech Thee to hear this prayer from me Thy
    servant full of sin.”</p>

  <p>And when he had ended this his prayer to God the Sovereign Father and Giver
    of all grace, and whilst the Calif and all the Saracens, and other people
    there, were looking on, the mountain rose out of its place and moved <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>to
    the spot which the Calif had pointed out! And when the Calif and all his
    Saracens beheld, they stood amazed at the wonderful miracle that God had
    wrought for the Christians, insomuch that a great number of the Saracens
    became Christians. And even the Calif caused himself to be baptised in the
    name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen, and became a
    Christian, but in secret. Howbeit, when he died they found a little cross
    hung round his neck; and therefore the Saracens would not bury him with the
    other Califs, but put him in a place apart. The Christians exulted greatly
    at this most holy miracle, and returned to their homes full of joy, giving
    thanks to their Creator for that which He had done.<a id="NoteAnchor_X11" href="#Note_X11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>And now you have heard in what wise took place this great miracle. And
    marvel not that the Saracens hate the Christians; for the accursed law that
    Mahommet gave them commands them to do all the mischief in their power to
    all other descriptions of people, and especially to Christians; to strip
    such of their goods, and do them all manner of evil, because they belong
    not to their law. See then what an evil law and what naughty commandments
    they have! But in such fashion the Saracens act, throughout the world.</p>

  <p>Now I have told you something of Baudas. I could easily indeed have told
    you first of the affairs and the customs of the people there. But it would
    be too long a business, looking to the great and strange things that I have
    got to tell you, as you will find detailed in this Book.</p>

  <p>So now I will tell you of the noble city of Tauris.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_X11" href="#NoteAnchor_X11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—We may remember that at a date only three years before Marco
      related this story (viz. in 1295), the cottage of Loreto is asserted to
      have changed its locality for the third and last time by moving to the site
      which it now occupies.</p>

    <p>Some of the old Latin copies place the scene at Tauris. And I observe that
      a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>missionary of the 16th century does the same. The mountain, he says,
      is between Tauris and Nakhshiwan, and is called <em>Manhuc</em>. (<em>Gravina</em>,
      <em>Christianità nell’ Armenia</em>, etc., Roma, 1605, p. 91.)</p>

    <p>The moving of a mountain is one of the miracles ascribed to Gregory
      Thaumaturgus. Such stories are rife among the Mahomedans themselves. “I
      know,” says Khanikoff, “at least half a score of mountains which the
      Musulmans allege to have come from the vicinity of Mecca.”</p>

    <p>Ramusio’s text adds here: “All the Nestorian and Jacobite Christians from
      that time forward have maintained a solemn celebration of the day on which
      the miracle occurred, keeping a fast also on the eve thereof.”</p>

    <p>F. Göring, a writer who contributes three articles on Marco Polo to the
      <cite>Neue Züricher-Zeitung</cite>, 5th, 6th, 8th April, 1878, says: “I heard related
      in Egypt a report which Marco Polo had transmitted to Baghdad. I will give
      it here in connection with another which I also came across in Egypt.</p>

    <p>“‘Many years ago there reigned in Babylon, on the Nile, a haughty Khalif
      who vexed the Christians with taxes and corvées. He was confirmed in his
      hate of the Christians by the Khakam Chacham Bashi or Chief Rabbi of the
      Jews, who one day said to him: “The Christians allege in their books that
      it shall not hurt them to drink or eat any deadly thing. So I have prepared
      a potion that one of them shall taste at my hand: if he does not die on
      the spot then call me no more Chacham Bashi!” The Khalif immediately sent
      for His Holiness the Patriarch of Babylon, and ordered him to drink up the
      potion. The Patriarch just blew a little over the cup and then emptied it
      at a draught, and took no harm. His Holiness then on his side demanded
      that the Chacham Bashi should quaff a cup to the health of the Khalif,
      which he (the Patriarch) should first taste, and this the Khalif found only
      fair and right. But hardly had the Chacham Bashi put the cup to his lips
      than he fell down and expired.’ Still the Musulmans and Jews thirsted for
      Christian blood. It happened at that time that a mass of the hill Mokattani
      became loose and threatened to come down upon Babylon. This was laid to the
      door of the Christians, and they were ordered to stop it. The Patriarch in
      great distress has a vision that tells him summon the saintly cobbler (of
      whom the same story is told as here)—the cobbler bids the rock to stand
      still and it does so to this day. ‘These two stories may still be heard
      in Cairo’—from whom is not said. The hill that threatened to fall on the
      Egyptian Babylon is called in Turkish <em>Dur Dagh</em>, ‘Stay, or halt-hill.’
      (<i>L.c.</i> April, 1878.)”—<cite>MS. Note</cite>, H.&nbsp;Y.</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Noble City of Tauris.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Tauris</span> is a great and noble city, situated in a great province called <span class="smcap">Yrac</span>,
    in which are many other towns and villages. But as Tauris is the most noble
    I will tell you about it.<a id="NoteAnchor_XI11" href="#Note_XI11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>The men of Tauris get their living by trade and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>handicrafts, for they
    weave many kinds of beautiful and valuable stuffs of silk and gold. The
    city has such a good position that merchandize is brought thither from
    India, Baudas, <span class="smcap">Cremesor</span>,<a id="NoteAnchor_XI12" href="#Note_XI12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> and many other regions; and that attracts
    many Latin merchants, especially Genoese, to buy goods and transact other
    business there; the more as it is also a great market for precious stones.
    It is a city in fact where merchants make large profits.<a id="NoteAnchor_XI13" href="#Note_XI13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>The people of the place are themselves poor creatures; and are a great
    medley of different classes. There are Armenians, Nestorians, Jacobites,
    Georgians, Persians, and finally the natives of the city themselves, who
    are worshippers of Mahommet. These last are a very evil generation; they
    are known as <span class="smcap">Taurizi</span>.<a id="NoteAnchor_XI14" href="#Note_XI14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> The city is all girt round with charming
    gardens, full of many varieties of large and excellent fruits.<a id="NoteAnchor_XI15" href="#Note_XI15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>Now we will quit Tauris, and speak of the great country of Persia. [From
    Tauris to Persia is a journey of twelve days.]</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XI11" href="#NoteAnchor_XI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Abulfeda notices that <span class="smcap">Tabríz</span> was vulgarly pronounced <em>Tauriz</em>, and
      this appears to have been adopted by the Franks. In Pegolotti the name is
      always <em>Torissi</em>.</p>

    <p>Tabriz is often reckoned to belong to Armenia, as by Hayton. Properly it
      is the chief city of <em>Azerbaiján</em>, which never was included in <span class="smcap">’Irák</span>. But
      it may be observed that Ibn Batuta generally calls the Mongol Ilkhan of
      Persia <em>Sáhib</em> or <em>Malik ul-’Irák</em>, and as Tabriz was the capital of that
      sovereign, we can account for the mistake, whilst admitting it to be one.
      [The destruction of Baghdad by Hulaku made Tabriz the great commercial and
      political city of Asia, and diverted the route of Indian products from
      the Mediterranean to the Euxine. It was the route to the Persian Gulf by
      Kashan, Yezd, and Kermán, to the Mediterranean by Lajazzo, and later on by
      Aleppo,—and to the Euxine by Trebizond. The destruction of the Kingdom of
      Armenia closed to Europeans the route of Tauris.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XI12" href="#NoteAnchor_XI12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—<em>Cremesor</em>, as Baldelli points out, is <span class="smcap">Garmsir</span>, meaning a hot
      region, a term which in Persia has acquired several specific applications,
      and especially indicates the coast-country on the N.E. side of the Persian
      Gulf, including Hormuz and the ports in that quarter.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XI13" href="#NoteAnchor_XI13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—[Of the Italians established at Tabriz, the first whose name is
      mentioned is the Venetian Pietro Viglioni (Vioni); his will, dated 10th
      December, 1264, is still in existence. (<cite>Archiv. Venet.</cite> XXVI. pp. 161–165;
      <cite>Heyd</cite>, French Ed., II. p. 110.)—H.&nbsp;C.] At a later date (1341) the Genoese
      had a factory at Tabriz headed by a consul <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>with a council of twenty-four
      merchants, and in 1320 there is evidence of a Venetian settlement there.
      (<cite>Elie de la Prim</cite>, 161; <cite>Heyd</cite>, II. 82.)</p>

    <p>Rashiduddin says of Tabriz that there were gathered there under the eyes
      of the Padishah of Islam “philosophers, astronomers, scholars, historians,
      of all religions, of all sects; people of Cathay, of Máchín, of India,
      of Kashmir, of Tibet, of the Uighúr and other Turkish nations, Arabs and
      Franks.” Ibn Batuta: “I traversed the bazaar of the jewellers, and my
      eyes were dazzled by the varieties of precious stones which I beheld.
      Handsome slaves, superbly dressed, and girdled with silk, offered their
      gems for sale to the Tartar ladies, who bought great numbers. [Odoric (ed.
      Cordier) speaks also of the great trade of Tabriz.] Tabriz maintained a
      large population and prosperity down to the 17th century, as may be seen
      in Chardin. It is now greatly fallen, though still a place of importance.”

      he means to say is that the people are called <em>Tabrízís</em>. Not recondite
      information, but ’tis his way. Just so he tells us in ch. iii. that
      the people of Hermenia are called Hermins, and elsewhere that the people of
      Tebet are called Tebet. So Hayton thinks it not inappropriate to say that
      the people of Catay are called Cataini, that the people of Corasmia are
      called Corasmins, and that the people of the cities of Persia are called
      Persians.</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Monastery of St. Barsamo on the Borders of Tauris.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the borders of (the territory of) Tauris there is a monastery called
    after Saint Barsamo, a most devout Saint. There is an Abbot, with many
    Monks, who wear a habit like that of the Carmelites, and these to avoid
    idleness are continually knitting woollen girdles. These they place upon
    the altar of St. Barsamo during the service, and when they go begging about
    the province (like the Brethren of the Holy Spirit) they present them
    to their friends and to the gentlefolks, for they are excellent things
    to remove bodily pain; wherefore every one is devoutly eager to possess
    them.<a id="NoteAnchor_XII11" href="#Note_XII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Barsauma (“The Son of Fasting”) was a native of Samosata, and
      an Archimandrite of the Asiatic Church. He opposed the Nestorians, but
      became himself still more obnoxious to the orthodox as a spreader of the
      Monophysite Heresy. He was condemned by the Council of Chalcedon (451), and
      died in 458. He is a Saint of fame in the Jacobite and Armenian Churches,
      and several monasteries were dedicated to him; but by far the most
      celebrated, and doubtless that meant here, was near Malatia. It must have
      been famous even among the Mahomedans, for it has an article in Bákúi’s
      Geog. Dictionary. (<cite>Dír-Barsúma</cite>, see <cite>N. et Ext.</cite> II. 515.) This monastery
      possessed relics of Barsauma and of St. Peter, and was sometimes the
      residence of the Jacobite Patriarch and the meeting-place of the Synods.</p>

    <p>A more marvellous story than Marco’s is related of this monastery by
      Vincent of Beauvais: “There is in that kingdom (Armenia) a place called
      St. Brassamus, at which there is a monastery for 300 monks. And ’tis said
      that if ever an enemy attacks it, the defences of the monastery move of
      themselves, and shoot back the shot against the besieger.”</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Great Country of Persia; with some account of the Three Kings.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Persia</span> is a great country, which was in old times very illustrious and
    powerful; but now the Tartars have wasted and destroyed it.</p>

  <p>In Persia is the city of <span class="smcap">Saba</span>, from which the Three Magi set out when they
    went to worship Jesus Christ; and in this city they are buried, in three
    very large and beautiful monuments, side by side. And above them there is a
    square building, carefully kept. The bodies are still entire, with the hair
    and beard remaining. One of these was called Jaspar, the second Melchior,
    and the third Balthasar. Messer Marco Polo asked a great many questions
    of the people of that city as to those Three Magi, but never one could he
    find that knew aught of the matter, except that these were three kings who
    were buried there in days of old. However, at a place three days’ journey
    distant he heard of what I am going to tell you. He found a village there
    which goes by the name of <span class="smcap">Cala Ataperistan</span>,<a id="NoteAnchor_XIII11" href="#Note_XIII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> which is as much as to
    say, “The Castle of the Fire-worshippers.” And the name is rightly applied,
    for the people there do worship fire, and I will tell you why.</p>

  <p>They relate that in old times three kings of that country went away to
    worship a Prophet that was born, and they carried with them three manner of
    offerings, Gold, and Frankincense, and Myrrh; in order to ascertain whether
    that Prophet were God, or an earthly King, or a Physician. For, said they,
    if he take the Gold, then he is an earthly King; if he take the Incense he
    is God; if he take the Myrrh he is a Physician.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

  <p>So it came to pass when they had come to the place where the Child was
    born, the youngest of the Three Kings went in first, and found the
    Child apparently just of his own age; so he went forth again marvelling
    greatly. The middle one entered next, and like the first he found the
    Child seemingly of his own age; so he also went forth again and marvelled
    greatly. Lastly, the eldest went in, and as it had befallen the other
    two, so it befell him. And he went forth very pensive. And when the three
    had rejoined one another, each told what he had seen; and then they all
    marvelled the more. So they agreed to go in all three together, and on
    doing so they beheld the Child with the appearance of its actual age, to
    wit, some thirteen days.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIII12" href="#Note_XIII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> Then they adored, and presented their Gold
    and Incense and Myrrh. And the Child took all the three offerings, and then
    gave them a small closed box; whereupon the Kings departed to return into
    their own land.</p>

      old man; Balthazar in his prime, with a beard; Gaspar young and beardless.

  </blockquote>

  <hr class="d40" />
  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XIV1"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER XIV</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">What befell when the Three Kings returned to their own Country.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> when they had ridden many days they said they would see what the
    Child had given them. So they opened the little box, and inside it they
    found a stone. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>On seeing this they began to wonder what this might be
    that the Child had given them, and what was the import thereof. Now the
    signification was this: when they presented their offerings, the Child had
    accepted all three, and when they saw that they had said within themselves
    that He was the True God, and the True King, and the True Physician.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIV11" href="#Note_XIV11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a>
    And what the gift of the stone implied was that this Faith which had
    begun in them should abide firm as a rock. For He well knew what was
    in their thoughts. Howbeit, they had no understanding at all of this
    signification of the gift of the stone; so they cast it into a well. Then
    straightway a fire from Heaven descended into that well wherein the stone
    had been cast.</p>

  <p>And when the Three Kings beheld this marvel they were sore amazed, and it
    greatly repented them that they had cast away the stone; for well they
    then perceived that it had a great and holy meaning. So they took of that
    fire, and carried it into their own country, and placed it in a rich and
    beautiful church. And there the people keep it continually burning, and
    worship it as a god, and all the sacrifices they offer are kindled with
    that fire. And if ever the fire becomes extinct they go to other cities
    round about where the same faith is held, and obtain of that fire from
    them, and carry it to the church. And this is the reason why the people of
    this country worship fire. They will often go ten days’ journey to get of
    that fire.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIV12" href="#Note_XIV12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>Such then was the story told by the people of that Castle to Messer Marco
    Polo; they declared to him for a truth that such was their history, and
    that one of the three kings was of the city called <span class="smcap">Saba</span>, and the second of
    <span class="smcap">Ava</span>, and the third of that very Castle where they still worship fire, with
    the people of all the country round about.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIV13" href="#Note_XIV13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

      apud se sempiternis foculis custodire, cujus portionem exiguam, ut faustam
      praeisse quondam Asiaticis Regibus dicunt.” (<cite>Ammian. Marcell.</cite> XXIII. 6.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIV13" href="#NoteAnchor_XIV13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Saba or Sava still exists as <span class="smcap">Sávah</span>, about 50 miles S.W. of Tehrân.
      It is described by Mr. Consul Abbott, who visited it in 1849, as the most
      ruinous town he had ever seen, and as containing about 1000 families. The
      people retain a tradition, mentioned by Hamd Allah Mastaufi, that the city
      stood on the shores of a Lake which dried up miraculously at the birth of
      Mahomed. Sávah is said to have possessed one of the greatest Libraries in
      the East, until its destruction by the Mongols on their first invasion of
      Persia. Both Sávah and Ávah (or Ábah) are mentioned by Abulfeda as cities
      of Jibal. We are told that the two cities were always at loggerheads, the
      former being Sunni and the latter Shiya. [We read in the <cite>Travels</cite> of
      Thévenot, a most intelligent traveller, “qu’il n’a rien écrit de l’ancienne
      ville de Sava qu’il trouva sur son chemin, et où il a marqué lui-même que
      son esprit de curiosité l’abandonna.” (<cite>Voyages</cite>, éd. 1727, vol. v. p. 343.
      He died a few days after at Miana, in Armenia, 28th November, 1667). (<cite>MS.
      Note.</cite>—H.&nbsp;Y.)]</p>

    <p>As regards the position of <span class="smcap">Avah</span>, Abbott says that a village still stands
      upon the site, about 16 miles S.S.E. of Sávah. He did not visit it, but
      took a bearing to it. He was told there was a mound there on which formerly
      stood a Gueber Castle. At Sávah he could find no trace of Marco Polo’s
      legend. Chardin, in whose time Sávah was not quite so far gone to decay,
      heard of an alleged tomb of Samuel, at 4 leagues from the city. This is
      alluded to by Hamd Allah.</p>

    <p>Keith Johnston and Kiepert put Ávah some 60 miles W.N.W. of Sávah, on the
      road between Kazvin and Hamadan. There seems to be some great mistake here.</p>

    <p>Friar Odoric puts the locality of the Magi at <em>Kashan</em>, though one of the
      versions of Ramusio and the Palatine MS. (see Cordier’s Odoric, pp. xcv.
      and 41 of his Itinerary), perhaps corrected in this, puts it at <em>Saba</em>.—H.&nbsp;Y.
      and H.&nbsp;C.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

    <p>We have no means of fixing the <em>Kala’ Atishparastán</em>. It is probable,
      however, that the story was picked up on the homeward journey, and as it
      seems to be implied that this castle was reached three days <em>after leaving</em>
      Sávah, I should look for it between Sávah and Abher. Ruins to which the
      name <em>Kila’-i-Gabr</em>, “Gueber Castle,” attaches are common in Persia.</p>

    <p>As regards the Legend itself, which shows such a curious mixture of
      Christian and Parsi elements, it is related some 350 years earlier by
      Mas’udi: “In the Province of Fars they tell you of a Well called the
      Well of Fire, near which there was a temple built. When the Messiah was
      born the King Koresh sent three messengers to him, the first of whom
      carried a bag of Incense, the second a bag of Myrrh, and the third a bag
      of Gold. They set out under the guidance of the Star which the king had
      described to them, arrived in Syria, and found the Messiah with Mary His
      Mother. This story of the three messengers is related by the Christians
      with sundry exaggerations; it is also found in the Gospel. Thus they say
      that the Star appeared to Koresh at the moment of Christ’s birth; that it
      went on when the messengers went on, and stopped when they stopped. More
      ample particulars will be found in our Historical Annals, where we have
      given the versions of this legend as current among the Guebers and among
      the Christians. It will be seen that Mary gave the king’s messengers a
      round loaf, and this, after different adventures, they hid under a rock
      in the province of Fars. The loaf disappeared underground, and there they
      dug a well, on which they beheld two columns of fire to start up flaming
      at the surface; in short, all the details of the legend will be found in
      our Annals.” The Editors say that Mas’udi had carried the story to Fars
      by mistaking <em>Shíz</em> in Azerbaiján (the Atropatenian Ecbatana of Sir H.
      Rawlinson) for <em>Shiraz</em>. A rudiment of the same legend is contained in the
      Arabic Gospel of the Infancy. This says that Mary gave the Magi one of the
      bands in which the Child was swathed. On their return they cast this into
      their sacred fire; though wrapt in the flame it remained unhurt.</p>

    <p>We may add that there was a Christian tradition that the Star descended
      into a well between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Gregory of Tours also relates
      that in a certain well, at Bethlehem, from which Mary had drawn water, the
      Star was sometimes seen, by devout pilgrims who looked carefully for it, to
      pass from one side to the other. But only such as merited the boon could
      see it.</p>

    <p>(See <cite>Abbott</cite> in <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXV. 4–6; <cite>Assemani</cite>, III. pt. 2, 750;
      <cite>Chardin</cite>, II. 407; <cite>N. et Ext.</cite> II. 465; <cite>Dict. de la Perse</cite>, 2, 56, 298;
      <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 51; <cite>Mas’udi</cite>, IV. 80; <cite>Greg. Turon. Libri Miraculorum</cite>,
      Paris, 1858, I. 8.)</p>

    <p>Several of the fancies that legend has attached to the brief story of
      the Magi in St. Matthew, such as the royal dignity of the persons; their
      location, now in Arabia, now (as here) at Saba in Persia, and again
      (as in Hayton and the Catalan Map) in Tarsia or Eastern Turkestan; the
      notion that one of them was a Negro, and so on, probably grew out of the
      arbitrary application of passages in the Old Testament, such as: “<i lang="la">Venient
      legati ex Aegypto</i>: <span class="smcap">Aethiopia</span> <i lang="la">praevenit manus ejus Deo</i>” (Ps. lxviii.
      31). This produced the Negro who usually is painted as one of the Three.
      “<i lang="la">Reges</i> <span class="smcap">Tharsis</span> <i lang="la">et Insulae munera offerent: Reges</i>
      <span class="smcap">Arabum</span> <i lang="la">et</i> <span class="smcap">Saba</span> <i lang="la">dona
      adducent</i>” (lxxii. 10). This made the Three into Kings, and fixed them
      in Tarsia, Arabia, and Sava. “<i lang="la">Mundatio Camelorum operiet te, dromedarii
      Madian et</i> <span class="smcap">Epha</span>: <i lang="la">omnes de</i> <span class="smcap">Saba</span> <i lang="la">venient aurum et thus deferentes et
      laudem Domino annunciantes</i>” (Is. lx. 6). Here were Ava and Sava coupled,
      as well as the gold and frankincense.</p>

    <p>One form of the old Church Legend was that the Three were buried at
      <em>Sessania Adrumetorum</em> (Hadhramaut) in Arabia, whence the Empress Helena
      had the bodies conveyed to Constantinople, [and later to Milan in the time
      of the Emperor Manuel Comnenus. After the fall of Milan (1162), Frederic
      Barbarossa gave them to Archbishop Rainald of Dassel (1159–1167), who
      carried them to Cologne (23rd July, 1164).—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The names given by Polo, Gaspar, Melchior, and Balthasar, have been
      accepted from an old date by the Roman Church; but an abundant variety of
      other names has been assigned to them. Hyde quotes a Syriac writer who
      calls them Aruphon, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>Hurmon, and Tachshesh, but says that some call them
      Gudphorbus, Artachshasht, and Labudo; whilst in Persian they were termed
      Amad, Zad-Amad, Drust-Amad, <i>i.e.</i> <em>Venit, Cito Venit, Sincerus Venit</em>.
      Some called them in Greek, Apellius, Amerus, and Damascus, and in Hebrew,
      Magaloth, Galgalath, and Saracia, but otherwise Ator, Sator, and Petatoros!
      The Armenian Church used the same names as the Roman, but in Chaldee they
      were Kaghba, Badadilma, Badada Kharida. (<cite>Hyde, Rel. Vet. Pers.</cite> 382–383;
      <cite>Inchofer, ut supra; J. As.</cite> sér. VI. IX. 160.)</p>

    <p>[Just before going to press we have read Major Sykes’ new book on <cite>Persia</cite>.
      Major Sykes (ch. xxiii.) does not believe that Marco visited Baghdád, and
      he thinks that the Venetians entered Persia near Tabriz, and travelled to
      Sultania, Kashán, and Yezd. Thence they proceeded to Kerman and Hormuz. We
      shall discuss this question in the Introduction.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XV1"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER XV</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Eight Kingdoms of Persia, and how they are named.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> you must know that Persia is a very great country, and contains eight
    kingdoms. I will tell you the names of them all.</p>

  <p>The first kingdom is that at the beginning of Persia, and it is called
    <span class="smcap">Casvin</span>; the second is further to the south, and is called <span class="smcap">Curdistan</span>; the
    third is <span class="smcap">Lor</span>; the fourth [<span class="smcap">Suolstan</span>]; the fifth <span class="smcap">Istanit</span>; the sixth <span class="smcap">Serazy</span>;
    the seventh <span class="smcap">Soncara</span>; the eighth <span class="smcap">Tunocain</span>, which is at the further extremity
    of Persia. All these kingdoms lie in a southerly direction except one, to
    wit, Tunocain; that lies towards the east, and borders on the (country of
    the) Arbre Sol.<a id="NoteAnchor_XV11" href="#Note_XV11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>In this country of Persia there is a great supply of fine horses; and
    people take them to India for sale, for they are horses of great price, a
    single one being worth as much of their money as is equal to 200 livres
    Tournois; some will be more, some less, according to the quality.<a id="NoteAnchor_XV12" href="#Note_XV12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    Here also are the finest asses in the world, one of them being worth full
    30 marks of silver, for they are very large and fast, and acquire a capital
    amble. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>Dealers carry their horses to Kisi and Curmosa, two cities on the
    shores of the Sea of India, and there they meet with merchants who take the
    horses on to India for sale.</p>

  <p>In this country there are many cruel and murderous people, so that no
    day passes but there is some homicide among them. Were it not for the
    Government, which is that of the Tartars of the Levant, they would do
    great mischief to merchants; and indeed, maugre the Government, they often
    succeed in doing such mischief. Unless merchants be well armed they run the
    risk of being murdered, or at least robbed of everything; and it sometimes
    happens that a whole party perishes in this way when not on their guard.
    The people are all Saracens, <i>i.e.</i> followers of the Law of Mahommet.<a id="NoteAnchor_XV13" href="#Note_XV13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>In the cities there are traders and artizans who live by their labour and
    crafts, weaving cloths of gold, and silk stuffs of sundry kinds. They have
    plenty of cotton produced in the country; and abundance of wheat, barley,
    millet, panick, and wine, with fruits of all kinds.</p>

  <p>[Some one may say, “But the Saracens don’t drink wine, which is prohibited
    by their law.” The answer is that they gloss their text in this way, that
    if the wine be boiled, so that a part is dissipated and the rest becomes
    sweet, they may drink without breach of the commandment; for it is then no
    longer called wine, the name being changed with the change of flavour.<a id="NoteAnchor_XV14" href="#Note_XV14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a>]
  </p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XV11" href="#NoteAnchor_XV11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The following appear to be Polo’s Eight Kingdoms:—</p>

    <p>I. <span class="smcap">Kazvín</span>; then a flourishing city, though I know not why he calls it a
      kingdom. Persian ’Irák, or the northern portion thereof, seems intended.
      Previous to Hulaku’s invasion Kazvín seems to have been in the hands of the
      Ismailites or Assassins.</p>

    <p>II. <span class="smcap">Kurdistan</span>. I do not understand the difficulties of Marsden, followed
      by Lazari and Pauthier, which lead them to put forth that Kurdistan is
      not Kurdistan but something else. The boundaries of Kurdistan according
      to Hamd Allah were Arabian ’Irák, Khuzistán, Persian ’Irák, Azerbaijan
      and Diarbekr. (<cite>Dict. de la P.</cite> 480.) [Cf. Curzon, <cite>Persia pass.</cite>—H.&nbsp;C.]
      Persian Kurdistan, in modern as in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>mediæval times, extends south beyond
      Kermanshah to the immediate border of Polo’s next kingdom, viz.:</p>

    <p>III. <span class="smcap">Lúr</span> or Lúristán. [On Lúristán, see Curzon, <cite>Persia</cite>, II. pp. 273–303,
      with the pedigree of the Ruling Family of the Feili Lurs (Pusht-i-Kuh),
      p. 278.—H.&nbsp;C.] This was divided into two principalities, Great Lúr and
      Little Lúr, distinctions still existing. The former was ruled by a Dynasty
      called the <em>Faslúyah</em> Atabegs, which endured from about 1155 to 1424, [when
      it was destroyed by the Timurids; it was a Kurd Dynasty, founded by Emad
      ed-din Abu Thaher (1160–1228), and the last prince of which was Ghiyas
      ed-din (1424). In 1258 the general Kitubuka (Hulagu’s <cite>Exp. to Persia</cite>,
      Bretschneider, <cite>Med. Res.</cite> I. p. 121) is reported to have reduced the
      country of Lúr or Lúristán and its Atabeg Teghele.—H.&nbsp;C.]. Their territory
      lay in the mountainous district immediately west of Ispahan, and extended
      to the River of Dizfúl, which parted it from Little Lúr. The stronghold
      of the Atabegs was the extraordinary hill fort of Mungasht, and they had
      a residence also at Aidhej or Mal-Amir in the mountains south of Shushan,
      where Ibn Batuta visited the reigning Prince in 1327. Sir H. Rawlinson has
      described Mungasht, and Mr. Layard and Baron de Bode have visited other
      parts, but the country is still very imperfectly known. Little Lúristán
      lay west of the R. Dizfúl, extending nearly to the Plain of Babylonia. Its
      Dynasty, called Kurshid, [was founded in 1184 by the Kurd Shodja ed-din
      Khurshid, and existed till Shah-Werdy lost his throne in 1593.—H.&nbsp;C.].</p>

    <p>The Lúrs are akin to the Kurds, and speak a Kurd dialect, as do all those
      Ilyáts, or nomads of Persia, who are not of Turkish race. They were noted
      in the Middle Ages for their agility and their dexterity in thieving. The
      tribes of Little Lúr “do not affect the slightest veneration for Mahomed
      or the Koran; their only general object of worship is their great Saint
      Baba Buzurg,” and particular disciples regard with reverence little short
      of adoration holy men looked on as living representatives of the Divinity.
      (<cite>Ilchan.</cite> I. 70 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Rawlinson</cite> in <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> IX.; <cite>Layard</cite> in <cite>Do.</cite>

      330, <cite>I. B.</cite> II. 31; <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, IV. 171–172.)</p>

    <p>IV. <span class="smcap">Shúlistán</span>, best represented by Ramusio’s <em>Suolstan</em>, whilst the old
      French texts have <em>Cielstan</em> (<i>i.e.</i> Shelstán); the name applied to the
      country of the <em>Shúls</em>, or <em>Shauls</em>, a people who long occupied a part of
      Lúristán, but were expelled by the Lúrs in the 12th century, and settled
      in the country between Shíráz and Khuzistán (now that of the Mamaseni,
      whom Colonel Pelly’s information identifies with the Shúls), their central
      points being Naobanján and the fortress called Kala’ Safed or “White
      Castle.” Ibn Batuta, going from Shiraz to Kazerun, encamped the first day
      in the country of the Shúls, “a Persian desert tribe which includes some
      pious persons.” (<cite>Q. R.</cite> p. 385; <cite>N. et E.</cite> XIII. i. 332–333; <cite>Ilch.</cite> I.
      71; <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XIII. Map; <cite>I. B.</cite> II. 88.) [“Adjoining the Kuhgelus
      on the East are the tents of the Mamasenni (qy. Mohammed Huseini) Lúrs,
      occupying the country still known as Shúlistán, and extending as far east
      and south-east as Fars and the Plain of Kazerun. This tribe prides itself
      on its origin, claiming to have come from Seistán, and to be directly
      descended from Rustam, whose name is still borne by one of the Mamasenni
      clans.” (Curzon, <cite>Persia</cite>, II. p. 318.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>V. <span class="smcap">Ispahan</span>? The name is in Ramusio <em>Spaan</em>, showing at least that he or
      some one before him had made this identification. The unusual combination
      <em>ff</em>, <i>i.e.</i> sf, in manuscript would be so like the frequent one <em>ft</em>, <i>i.e.</i>
      st, that the change from Isfan to Istan would be easy. But why Istan<em>it</em>?</p>

    <p>VI. <span class="smcap">Shíráz</span> [(<em>Shir</em> = milk, or <em>Shir</em> = lion)—H.&nbsp;C.] representing the
      province of Fars or Persia Proper, of which it has been for ages the chief
      city. [It was founded after the Arab conquest in 694 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>, by Mohammed, son
      of Yusuf Kekfi. (Curzon, <cite>Persia</cite>, II. pp. 93–110.)—H.&nbsp;C.] The last Dynasty
      that had reigned in Fars was that of the Salghur Atabegs, founded about the
      middle of the 12th century. Under Abubakr (1226–1260) this kingdom attained
      considerable power, embracing Fars, Kermán, the islands of the Gulf and its
      Arabian shores; and Shíráz then flourished in arts and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>literature; Abubakr
      was the patron of Saadi. From about 1262, though a Salghurian princess,
      married to a son of Hulaku, had the nominal title of Atabeg, the province
      of Fars was under Mongol administration. (<cite>Ilch. passim</cite>.)</p>

    <p>VII. <span class="smcap">Shawánkára</span> or Shabánkára. The G.&nbsp;T. has <em>Soucara</em>, but the Crusca
      gives the true reading <em>Soncara</em>. It is the country of the Shawánkárs, a
      people coupled with the Shúls and Lúrs in mediæval Persian history, and
      like them of Kurd affinities. Their princes, of a family Faslúyah, are
      spoken of as influential before the Mahomedan conquest, but the name of
      the people comes prominently forward only during the Mongol era of Persian
      history. [Shabánkára was taken in 1056 from the Buyid Dynasty, who ruled
      from the 10th century over a great part of Persia, by Fazl ibn Hassan
      (Fazluïeh-Hasunïeh). Under the last sovereign, Ardeshir, Shabánkára was
      taken in 1355 by the Modhafferians, who reigned in ’Irák, Fars, and Kermán,
      one of the Dynasties established at the expense of the Mongol Ilkhans after
      the death of Abu Saïd (1335), and were themselves subjugated by Timur in
      1392.—H.&nbsp;C.] Their country lay to the south of the great salt lake east of
      Shíráz, and included Niriz and Darábjird, Fassa, Forg, and Tárum. Their
      capital was I′g or I′j, called also Irej, about 20 miles north-west of
      Daráb, with a great mountain fortress; it was taken by Hulaku in 1259.
      The son of the prince was continued in nominal authority, with Mongol
      administrators. In consequence of a rebellion in 1311 the Dynasty seems to
      have been extinguished. A descendant attempted to revive their authority
      about the middle of the same century. The latest historical mention of the
      name that I have found is in Abdurrazzák’s <cite>History of Shah Rukh</cite>, under
      the year H. 807 (1404). (See <cite>Jour. As.</cite> 3d. s. vol. ii. 355.) But a note
      by Colonel Pelly informs me that the name Shabánkára is still applied (1)
      to the district round the towns of Runiz and Gauristan near Bandar Abbas;
      (2) to a village near Maiman, in the old country of the tribe; (3) to a
      <em>tribe</em> and district of Dashtistan, 38 farsakhs west of Shíráz.</p>

    <p>With reference to the form in the text, <em>Soncara</em>, I may notice that in
      two passages of the <cite>Masálak-ul-Absár</cite>, translated by Quatremère, the name
      occurs as <em>Shankárah</em>. (<cite>Q. R.</cite> pp. 380, 440 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>N. et E.</cite> XIII.;
      <cite>Ilch.</cite> I. 71 and <cite>passim; Ouseley’s Travels</cite>, II. 158 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>

    <p>VIII. <span class="smcap">Tún-o-Káin</span>, the eastern Kuhistán or Hill country of Persia, of which
      Tún and Káin are chief cities. The practice of indicating a locality by
      combining two names in this way is common in the East. Elsewhere in this
      book we find <em>Ariora-Keshemur</em> and <em>Kes-macoran</em> (Kij-Makrán). Upper Sind
      is often called in India by the Sepoys <em>Rori-Bakkar</em>, from two adjoining
      places on the Indus; whilst in former days, Lower Sind was often called
      <em>Diul-Sind. Karra-Mánikpúr, Uch-Multán, Kunduz-Baghlán</em> are other examples.</p>

    <p>The exact expression <em>Tún-o-Káin</em> for the province here in question is used
      by Baber, and evidently also by some of Hammer’s authorities. (<cite>Baber</cite>,
      pp. 201, 204; see <cite>Ilch.</cite> II. 190; I. 95, 104, and <cite>Hist. de l’Ordre des
      Assassins</cite>, p. 245.)</p>

    <p>[We learn from (Sir) C. Macgregor’s (1875) <cite>Journey through Khorasan</cite> (I.
      p. 127) that the same territory including Gháín or Kaïn is now called by
      the analogous name of Tabas-o-Tún. Tún and Kaïn (Gháín) are both described
      in their modern state, by Macgregor. (<i>Ibid.</i> pp. 147 and 161.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Note that the identification of <em>Suolstan</em> is due to Quatremère (see <cite>N.
      et E.</cite> XIII. i. <i>circa</i> p. 332); that of <em>Soncara</em> to Defréméry (<cite>J. As.</cite>
      sér. IV. tom. xi. p. 441); and that of <em>Tunocain</em> to Malte-Brun. (<cite>N.
      Ann. des V.</cite> xviii. p. 261.) I may add that the <em>Lúrs</em>, the <em>Shúls</em>, and
      the <i>Shabánkáras</i> are the subjects of three successive sections in the
      <cite>Masálak-al-Absár</cite> of <cite>Shihábuddin Dimishki</cite>, a work which reflects much of
      Polo’s geography. (See <cite>N. et E.</cite> XIII. i. 330–333; Curzon, <cite>Persia</cite>, II.
      pp. 248 and 251.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XV12" href="#NoteAnchor_XV12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—The horses exported to India, of which we shall hear more
      hereafter, were probably the same class of “Gulf Arabs” that are now
      carried thither. But the Turkman horses of Persia are also very valuable,
      especially for endurance. Kinneir speaks of one accomplishing 900 miles in
      eleven days, and Ferrier states a still more extraordinary feat from his
      own knowledge. In that case one of those horses went <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>from Tehran to Tabriz,
      returned, and went again to Tabriz, within twelve days, including two days’
      rest. The total distance is about 1100 miles.</p>

    <p>The <i lang="fr">livre tournois</i> at this period was equivalent to a little over 18
      francs of modern French silver. But in bringing the value to our modern
      gold standard we must add one-third, as the ratio of silver to gold was
      then 1:12 instead of 1:16. Hence the equivalent in gold of the livre
      tournois is very little less than 1<i>l.</i> sterling, and the price of the
      horse would be about 193<i>l.</i><a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>Mr. Wright quotes an ordinance of Philip III. of France (1270–1285)
      fixing the maximum price that might be given for a palfrey at 60 <i lang="fr">livres
      tournois</i>, and for a squire’s <em>roncin</em> at 20 livres. Joinville, however,
      speaks of a couple of horses presented to St. Lewis in 1254 by the Abbot
      of Cluny, which he says would at the time of his writing (1309) have been
      worth 500 livres (the pair, it would seem). Hence it may be concluded
      in a general way that the <em>ordinary</em> price of imported horses in India
      approached that of the highest class of horses in Europe. (<cite>Hist. of Dom.
      Manners</cite>, p. 317; <cite>Joinville</cite>, p. 205.)</p>

    <p>About 1850 a very fair Arab could be purchased in Bombay for 60<i>l.</i>, or
      even less; but prices are much higher now.</p>

    <p>With regard to the donkeys, according to Tavernier, the fine ones used
      by merchants in Persia were imported from Arabia. The mark of silver was
      equivalent to about 44<i>s.</i> of our silver money, and allowing as before for
      the lower relative value of gold, 30 marks would be equivalent to 88<i>l.</i>
      sterling.</p>

    <p><em>Kisi</em> or Kish we have already heard of. <em>Curmosa</em> is Hormuz, of which
      we shall hear more. With a Pisan, as Rusticiano was, the sound of <em>c</em> is
      purely and strongly aspirate. Giovanni d’Empoli, in the beginning of the
      16th century, another Tuscan, also calls it <em>Cormus</em>. (See <cite>Archiv. Stor.
      Ital.</cite> Append. III. 81.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XV13" href="#NoteAnchor_XV13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The character of the nomad and semi-nomad tribes of Persia in those
      days—Kurds, Lúrs, Shúls, Karaunahs, etc.—probably deserved all that Polo
      says, and it is not changed now. Take as an example Rawlinson’s account of
      the Bakhtyáris of Luristán: “I believe them to be individually brave, but
      of a cruel and savage character; they pursue their blood feuds with the
      most inveterate and exterminating spirit.... It is proverbial in Persia
      that the Bakhtiyaris have been compelled to forego altogether the reading
      of the <cite>Fatihah</cite> or prayer for the dead, for otherwise they would have no
      other occupation. They are also most dextrous and notorious thieves.” (<cite>J.
      R. G. S.</cite> IX. 105.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XV14" href="#NoteAnchor_XV14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—The Persians have always been lax in regard to the abstinence from
      wine.</p>

    <p>According to Athenaeus, Aristotle, in his <cite>Treatise on Drinking</cite> (a work
      lost, I imagine, to posterity), says, “If the wine be moderately boiled
      it is less apt to intoxicate.” In the preparation of some of the sweet
      wines of the Levant, such as that of Cyprus, the must is boiled, but I
      believe this is not the case <em>generally</em> in the East. Baber notices it as
      a peculiarity among the Kafirs of the Hindu Kush. Tavernier, however, says
      that at Shíráz, besides the wine for which that city was so celebrated, a
      good deal of <em>boiled wine</em> was manufactured, and used among the poor and
      by travellers. No doubt what is meant is the sweet liquor or syrup called
      <em>Dúsháb</em>, which Della Valle says is just the Italian <i lang="it">Mostocotto</i>, but
      better, clearer, and not so mawkish (I. 689). (<cite>Yonge’s Athen.</cite> X. 34;

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Great City of Yasdi.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Yasdi</span> also is properly in Persia; it is a good and noble city, and has a
    great amount of trade. They weave there quantities of a certain silk tissue
    known as <em>Yasdi</em>, which merchants carry into many quarters to dispose of.
    The people are worshippers of Mahommet.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVI11" href="#Note_XVI11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>When you leave this city to travel further, you ride for seven days over
    great plains, finding harbour to receive you at three places only. There
    are many fine woods [producing dates] upon the way, such as one can easily
    ride through; and in them there is great sport to be had in hunting and
    hawking, there being partridges and quails and abundance of other game, so
    that the merchants who pass that way have plenty of diversion. There are
    also wild asses, handsome creatures. At the end of those seven marches over
    the plain you come to a fine kingdom which is called Kerman.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVI12" href="#Note_XVI12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XVI11" href="#NoteAnchor_XVI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—<span class="smcap">Yezd</span>, an ancient city, supposed by D’Anville to be the <em>Isatichae</em>
      of Ptolemy, is not called by Marco a kingdom, though having a better
      title to the distinction than some which he classes as such. The atabegs
      of Yezd dated from the middle of the 11th century, and their Dynasty was
      permitted by the Mongols to continue till the end of the 13th, when it was
      extinguished by Ghazan, and the administration made over to the Mongol
      Diwan.</p>

    <p>Yezd, in pre-Mahomedan times, was a great sanctuary of the Gueber worship,
      though now it is a seat of fanatical Mahomedanism. It is, however, one of
      the few places where the old religion lingers. In 1859 there were reckoned
      850 families of Guebers in Yezd and fifteen adjoining villages, but they
      diminish rapidly.</p>

    <p>[Heyd (<cite>Com. du Levant</cite>, II. p. 109) says the inhabitants of Yezd wove the
      finest silk of Taberistan.—H.&nbsp;C.] The silk manufactures still continue,
      and, with other weaving, employ a large part of the population. The
      <em>Yazdi</em>, which Polo mentions, finds a place in the Persian dictionaries,
      and is spoken of by D’Herbelot as <em>Ḳumásh-i-Yezdi</em>, “Yezd stuff.” [“He
      [Nadir Shah] bestowed upon the ambassador [Hakeem Ataleek, the prime
      minister of Abulfiez Khan, King of Bokhara] a donation of a thousand
      mohurs of Hindostan, twenty-five pieces of <em>Yezdy</em> brocade, a rich dress,
      and a horse with silver harness....” (<cite>Memoirs of Khojah Abdulkurreem,
      a Cashmerian <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>of distinction ... transl. from the original Persian</cite>, by
      Francis Gladwin ... Calcutta, 1788, 8vo, p. 36.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Yezd is still a place of important trade, and carries on a thriving
      commerce with India by Bandar Abbási. A visitor in the end of 1865 says:
      “The external trade appears to be very considerable, and the merchants of
      Yezd are reputed to be amongst the most enterprising and respectable of
      their class in Persia. Some of their agents have lately gone, not only to
      Bombay, but to the Mauritius, Java, and China.”</p>

    <p>(<cite>Ilch.</cite> I. 67–68; <cite>Khanikoff, Mém.</cite> p. 202; <cite>Report by Major R. M. Smith</cite>, R.E.)</p>

    <p>Friar Odoric, who visited Yezd, calls it the third best city of the Persian
      Emperor, and says (<cite>Cathay</cite>, I. p. 52): “There is very great store of
      victuals and all other good things that you can mention; but especially
      is found there great plenty of figs; and raisins also, green as grass and
      very small, are found there in richer profusion than in any other part of
      the world.” [He also gives from the smaller version of Ramusio’s an awful
      description of the Sea of Sand, one day distant from Yezd. (Cf. Tavernier,
      1679, I. p. 116.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVI12" href="#NoteAnchor_XVI12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—I believe Della Valle correctly generalises when he says of
      Persian travelling that “you always travel in a plain, but you always
      have mountains on either hand” (I. 462). [Compare Macgregor, I. 254: “I
      really cannot describe the road. Every road in Persia as yet seems to
      me to be exactly alike, so ... my readers will take it for granted that
      the road went over a waste, with barren rugged hills in the distance, or
      near; no water, no houses, no people passed.”—H.&nbsp;C.] The distance from
      Yezd to Kermán is, according to Khanikoff’s survey, 314 <em>kilomètres</em>, or
      about 195 miles. Ramusio makes the time eight days, which is probably the
      better reading, giving a little over 24 miles a day. Westergaard in 1844,
      and Khanikoff in 1859, took <em>ten</em> days; Colonel Goldsmid and Major Smith
      in 1865 <em>twelve</em>. [“The distance from Yezd to Kermán by the present high
      road, 229 miles, is by caravans, generally made in nine stages; persons
      travelling with all comforts do it in twelve stages; travellers whose time
      is of some value do it easily in <em>seven</em> days.” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i>
      pp. 490–491.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Khanikoff observes on this chapter: “This notice of woods easy to ride
      through, covering the plain of Yezd, is very curious. Now you find it a
      plain of great extent indeed from N.W. to S.E., but narrow and arid; indeed
      I saw in it only thirteen inhabited spots, counting two caravanserais.
      Water for the inhabitants is brought from a great distance by subterraneous
      conduits, a practice which may have tended to desiccate the soil, for every
      trace of wood has completely disappeared.”</p>

    <p>Abbott travelled from Yezd to Kermán in 1849, by a road through Báfk,
      <em>east</em> of the usual road, which Khanikoff followed, and parallel to it;
      and it is worthy of note that he found circumstances more accordant with
      Marco’s description. Before getting to Báfk he says of the plain that it
      “extends to a great distance north and south, and is probably 20 miles
      in breadth;” whilst Báfk “is remarkable for its <em>groves of date-trees</em>,
      in the midst of which it stands, and which occupy a considerable space.”
      Further on he speaks of “wild tufts and bushes growing abundantly,” and
      then of “thickets of the <em>Ghez</em> tree.” He heard of the wild asses, but did
      not see any. In his report to the Foreign Office, alluding to Marco Polo’s
      account, he says: “It is still true that wild asses and other game are
      found in the <em>wooded spots</em> on the road.” The ass is the <i>Asinus Onager</i>,
      the <em>Gor Khar</em> of Persia, or <em>Kulan</em> of the Tartars. (<cite>Khan. Mém.</cite> p.
      200; <cite>Id. sur Marco Polo</cite>, p. 21; <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXV. 20–29; <cite>Mr. Abbott’s
      MS. Report in Foreign office</cite>.) [The difficulty has now been explained by
      General Houtum-Schindler in a valuable paper published in the <cite>Jour. Roy.
      As. Soc.</cite> N.S. XIII., October, 1881, p. 490. He says: “Marco Polo travelled
      from Yazd to Kermán <i>viâ</i> Báfk. His description of the road, seven days over
      great plains, harbour at three places only, is perfectly exact. The fine
      woods, producing dates, are at Báfk itself. (The place is generally called
      Báft.) Partridges and quails still abound; wild asses I saw several on the
      western road, and I was told that there were a great many on the Báfk road.
      Travellers and caravans now always go by the eastern road <i>viâ</i> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>Anár and
      Bahrámábád. Before the Sefavíehs (<i>i.e.</i> before <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1500) the Anár road was
      hardly, if ever, used; travellers always took the Báfk road. The country
      from Yazd to Anár, 97 miles, seems to have been totally uninhabited before
      the Sefavíehs. Anár, as late as <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1340, is mentioned as the frontier
      place of Kermán to the north, on the confines of the Yazd desert. When
      Sháh Abbás had caravanserais built at three places between Yazd and Anár
      (Zein ud-dín, Kermán-sháhán, and Shamsh), the eastern road began to be
      neglected.” (Cf. Major Sykes’ <cite>Persia</cite>, ch. xxiii.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Kingdom of Kerman.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Kerman</span> is a kingdom which is also properly in Persia, and formerly it had
    a hereditary prince. Since the Tartars conquered the country the rule is
    no longer hereditary, but the Tartar sends to administer whatever lord he
    pleases.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVII11" href="#Note_XVII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> In this kingdom are produced the stones called turquoises
    in great abundance; they are found in the mountains, where they are
    extracted from the rocks.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVII12" href="#Note_XVII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> There are also plenty of veins of steel
    and <em>Ondanique</em>.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVII13" href="#Note_XVII13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> The people are very skilful in making harness of
    war; their saddles, bridles, spurs, swords, bows, quivers, and arms of
    every kind, are very well made indeed according to the fashion of those
    parts. The ladies of the country and their daughters also produce exquisite
    needlework in the embroidery of silk stuffs in different colours, with
    figures of beasts and birds, trees and flowers, and a variety of other
    patterns. They work hangings for the use of noblemen so deftly that they
    are marvels to see, as well as cushions, pillows quilts, and all sorts of
    things.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVII14" href="#Note_XVII14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>In the mountains of Kerman are found the best falcons in the world. They
    are inferior in size to the Peregrine, red on the breast, under the neck,
    and between the thighs; their flight so swift that no bird can escape
    them.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVII15" href="#Note_XVII15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

  <p>On quitting the city you ride on for seven days, always finding towns,
    villages, and handsome dwelling-houses, so that it is very pleasant
    travelling; and there is excellent sport also to be had by the way in
    hunting and hawking. When you have ridden those seven days over a plain
    country, you come to a great mountain; and when you have got to the top of
    the pass you find a great descent which occupies some two days to go down.
    All along you find a variety and abundance of fruits; and in former days
    there were plenty of inhabited places on the road, but now there are none;
    and you meet with only a few people looking after their cattle at pasture.
    From the city of Kerman to this descent the cold in winter is so great that
    you can scarcely abide it, even with a great quantity of clothing.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVII16" href="#Note_XVII16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XVII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XVII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Kermán is mentioned by Ptolemy, and also by Ammianus amongst the
      cities of the country so called (<em>Carmania</em>): “<em>inter quas nitet</em> Carmana
      <em>omnium mater</em>.” (XXIII. 6.)</p>

    <p>M. Pauthier’s supposition that <em>Sirján</em> was in Polo’s time the capital, is
      incorrect. (See <cite>N. et E.</cite> XIV. 208, 290.) Our Author’s Kermán is the city
      still so called; and its proper name would seem to have been <em>Kuwáshír</em>.
      (See <cite>Reinaud, Mém. sur l’Inde</cite>, 171; also <cite>Sprenger P. and R. R.</cite> 77.)
      According to Khanikoff it is 5535 feet above the sea.</p>

    <p>Kermán, on the fall of the Beni Búya Dynasty, in the middle of the 11th
      century, came into the hands of a branch of the Seljukian Turks, who
      retained it till the conquests of the Kings of Khwarizm, which just
      preceded the Mongol invasion. In 1226 the Amir Borák, a Kara Khitaian,
      who was governor on behalf of Jaláluddin of Khwarizm, became independent
      under the title of Kutlugh Sultan. [He died in 1234.] The Mongols allowed
      this family to retain the immediate authority, and at the time when Polo
      returned from China the representative of the house was a lady known as
      the <em>Pádishah Khátún</em> [who reigned from 1291], the wife successively of
      the Ilkhans Abaka and Kaikhatu; an ambitious, clever, and masterful woman,
      who put her own brother Siyurgutmish to death as a rival, and was herself,
      after the decease of Kaikhatu, put to death by her brother’s widow and
      daughter [1294]. The Dynasty continued, nominally at least, to the reign
      of the Ilkhan Khodabanda (1304–13), when it was extinguished. [See Major
      Sykes’ <cite>Persia</cite>, chaps, v. and xxiii.]</p>

    <p>Kermán was a Nestorian see, under the Metropolitan of Fars. (<cite>Ilch. passim;
      Weil</cite>, III. 454; <cite>Lequien</cite>, II. 1256.)</p>

    <p>[“There is some confusion with regard to the names of Kermán both as a
      town and as a province or kingdom. We have the names Kermán, Kuwáshír,
      Bardshír. I should say the original name of the whole country was Kermán,
      the ancient Karamania. A province of this was called Kúreh-i-Ardeshír,
      which, being contracted, became Kuwáshír, and is spoken of as the province
      in which Ardeshír Bábekán, the first Sassanian monarch, resided. A part of
      Kúreh-i-Ardeshír was called Bardshír, or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>Bard-i-Ardeshír, now occasionally
      Bardsír, and the present city of Kermán was situated at its north-eastern
      corner. This town, during the Middle Ages, was called Bardshír. On a coin
      of Qara Arslán Beg, King of Kermán, of <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span> 462, Mr. Stanley Lane Poole
      reads Yazdashír instead of Bardshír. Of Al Idrísí’s Yazdashír I see no
      mention in histories; Bardshír was the capital and the place where most
      of the coins were struck. Yazdashír, if such a place existed, can only
      have been a place of small importance. It is, perhaps, a clerical error
      for Bardshír; without diacritical points, both words are written alike.
      Later, the name of the city became Kermán, the name Bardshír reverting to
      the district lying south-west of it, with its principal place Mashíz. In a
      similar manner Mashíz was often, and is so now, called Bardshír. Another
      old town sometimes confused with Bardshír was Sírján or Shírján, once more
      important than Bardshír; it is spoken of as the capital of Kermán, of
      Bardshír, and of Sardsír. Its name now exists only as that of a district,
      with principal place S’aídábád. The history of Kermán, ’Agd-ul-’Olá,
      plainly says Bardshír is the capital of Kermán, and from the description
      of Bardshír there is no doubt of its having been the present town Kermán.
      It is strange that Marco Polo does not give the name of the city. In
      Assemanni’s <cite>Bibliotheca Orientalis</cite> Kuwáshír and Bardashír are mentioned
      as separate cities, the latter being probably the old Mashíz, which as
      early as <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span> 582 (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1186) is spoken of in the <cite>History of Kermán</cite> as
      an important town. The Nestorian bishop of the province Kermán, who stood
      under the Metropolitan of Fars, resided at Hormúz.” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>,
      <i>l.c.</i> pp. 491–492.)</p>

    <p>There does not seem any doubt as to the identity of Bardashir with
      the present city of Kermán. (See <cite>The Cities of Kirmān in the time of
      Hamd-Allah Mustawfi and Marco Polo</cite>, by Guy le Strange, <cite>Jour. R. As. Soc.</cite>
      April, 1901, pp. 281, 290.) Hamd-Allah is the author of the Cosmography
      known as the <cite>Nuzhat-al-Kūlūb</cite> or “Heart’s Delight.” (Cf. Major Sykes’

      <em>Shebavek</em> in Kermán as the site of a Turquoise mine. This is probably
      <em>Shahr-i-Babek</em>, about 100 miles west of the city of Kermán, and not far
      from <em>Párez</em>, where Abbott tells us there is a mine of these stones, now
      abandoned. Goebel, one of Khanikoff’s party, found a deposit of turquoises
      at Taft, near Yezd. (<cite>Ouseley’s Travels</cite>, I. 211; <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXVI.
      63–65; <cite>Khan. Mém.</cite> 203.)</p>

    <p>[“The province Kermán is still rich in turquoises. The mines of Páríz
      or Párez are at Chemen-i-mó-aspán, 16 miles from Páríz on the road to
      Bahrámábád (principal place of Rafsinján), and opposite the village or
      garden called Gód-i-Ahmer. These mines were worked up to a few years ago;
      the turquoises were of a pale blue. Other turquoises are found in the
      present Bardshír plain, and not far from Mashíz, on the slopes of the
      Chehel tan mountain, opposite a hill called the Bear Hill (tal-i-Khers).
      The Shehr-i-Bábek turquoise mines are at the small village Kárík, a mile
      from Medvár-i-Bálá, 10 miles north of Shehr-i-Bábek. They have two shafts,
      one of which has lately been closed by an earthquake, and were worked up
      to about twenty years ago. At another place, 12 miles from Shehr-i-Bábek,
      are seven old shafts now not worked for a long period. The stones of
      these mines are also of a very pale blue, and have no great value.”
      (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> 1881, p. 491.)</p>

    <p>The finest turquoises came from Khorasan; the mines were near Maaden, about
      48 miles to the north of Nishapūr. (Heyd, <cite>Com. du Levant</cite>, II. p. 653;
      Ritter, <cite>Erdk.</cite> pp. 325–330.)</p>

    <p>It is noticeable that Polo does not mention indigo at Kermán.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVII13" href="#NoteAnchor_XVII13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Edrisi says that excellent iron was produced in the “cold

      borders of Kermán, were famous. These are also spoken of by Teixeira. Major

    <p>[“Marco Polo’s steel mines are probably the Parpa iron mines on the road
      from Kermán to Shíráz, called even to-day M’aden-i-fúlád (steel mine); they
      are not worked now. Old Kermán weapons, daggers, swords, old stirrups,
      etc., made of steel, are really beautiful, and justify Marco Polo’s praise
      of them” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 491.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><em>Ondanique</em> of the Geog. Text, <em>Andaine</em> of Pauthier’s, <em>Andanicum</em> of
      the Latin, is an expression on which no light has been thrown since
      Ramusio’s time. The latter often asked the Persian merchants who visited
      Venice, and they all agreed in stating that it was a sort of steel of
      such surpassing value and excellence, that in the days of yore a man who
      possessed a mirror, or sword, of <em>Andanic</em> regarded it as he would some
      precious jewel. This seems to me excellent evidence, and to give the true
      clue to the meaning of <em>Ondanique</em>. I have retained the latter form because
      it points most distinctly to what I believe to be the real word, viz.
      <em>Hundwáníy</em>, “Indian Steel.”<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (See <cite>Johnson’s Pers. Dict.</cite> and <cite>De Sacy’s
      Chrestomathie Arabe</cite>, II. 148.) In the <cite>Vocabulista Arabico</cite>, of about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
      1200 (Florence, 1871, p. 211), <em>Hunduwán</em> is explained by <em>Ensis</em>. Vüllers
      explains <em>Hundwán</em> as “anything peculiar to India, especially swords,” and
      quotes from Firdúsi, “<em>Khanjar-i-Hundwán</em>,” a hanger of Indian steel.</p>

    <p>The like expression appears in the quotation from Edrisi below as
      <em>Hindiah</em>, and found its way into Spanish in the shapes of <em>Alhinde,
      Alfinde, Alinde</em>, first with the meaning of <em>steel</em>, then assuming, that of
      <em>steel mirror</em>, and finally that of metallic foil of a glass mirror. (See
      <cite>Dozy</cite> and <cite>Engelmann</cite>, 2d ed. pp. 144–145.) <em>Hint</em> or <em>Al-hint</em> is used in
      Berber also for steel. (See <cite>J. R. A. S.</cite> IX. 255.)</p>

    <p>The sword-blades of India had a great fame over the East, and Indian steel,
      according to esteemed authorities, continued to be imported into Persia
      till days quite recent. Its fame goes back to very old times. Ctesias
      mentions two wonderful swords of such material that he got from the king
      of Persia and his mother. It is perhaps the <i lang="la">ferrum candidum</i> of which the
      Malli and Oxydracae sent a 100 talents weight as a present to Alexander.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
      Indian Iron and Steel (<span lang="el">σíδηρος Ἰνδικòς καì στóμωμα</span>) are mentioned
      in the <cite>Periplus</cite> as imports into the Abyssinian ports. <i lang="la">Ferrum Indicum</i>
      appears (at least according to one reading) among the Oriental <em>species</em>
      subject to duty in the Law of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus on that matter.
      Salmasius notes that among surviving Greek chemical treatises there was one
      περì βαφῆς Ἰνδικοῦ σιδήρου, “On the Tempering of Indian Steel.”
      Edrisi says on this subject: “The Hindus excel in the manufacture of iron,
      and in the preparation of those ingredients along with which it is fused
      to obtain that kind of soft Iron which is usually styled <em>Indian Steel</em>
      (<span class="smcap">Hindiah</span>).<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> They also have workshops wherein are forged the most famous
      sabres in the world.... It is impossible to find anything to surpass the
      edge that you get from Indian Steel (<em>al-hadíd al-Hindí</em>).”</p>

    <p>Allusions to the famous sword-blades of India would seem to be frequent in
      Arabic literature. Several will be found in Hamása’s collection of ancient
      Arabic poems translated by Freytag. The old commentator on one of these
      passages says: “<em>Ut optimos gladios significet</em> ... Indicos <em>esse dixit</em>,”
      and here the word used in the original is <em>Hundwániyah</em>. In Manger’s
      version of Arabshah’s <cite>Life of Timur</cite> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>are several allusions of the same
      kind; one, a quotation from <cite>Antar</cite>, recalls the <i lang="la">ferrum candidum</i> of
      Curtius:</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“Albi (gladii) Indici <em>meo in sanguine abluuntur</em>.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">In the histories, even of the Mahomedan conquest of India, the Hindu
      infidels are sent to <em>Jihannam</em> with “the well-watered blade of the Hindi
      sword”; or the sword is personified as “a Hindu of good family.” Coming
      down to later days, Chardin says of the steel of Persia: “They combine it
      with Indian steel, which is more tractable ... and is much more esteemed.”
      Dupré, at the beginning of this century, tells us: “I used to believe
      ... that the steel for the famous Persian sabres came from certain mines
      in Khorasan. But according to all the information I have obtained, I can
      assert that no mine of steel exists in that province. What is used for
      these blades comes in the shape of disks from Lahore.” Pottinger names
      <em>steel</em> among the imports into Kermán from India. Elphinstone the Accurate,
      in his <cite>Caubul</cite>, confirms Dupré: “Indian Steel [in Afghanistan] is most
      prized for the material; but the best swords are made in Persia and in
      Syria;” and in his <cite>History of India</cite>, he repeats: “The steel of India was
      in request with the ancients; it is celebrated in the oldest Persian poem,
      and is still the material of the scimitars of Khorasan and Damascus.”<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

    <p>Klaproth, in his <cite>Asia Polyglotta</cite>, gives <em>Andun</em> as the Ossetish and
      <em>Andan</em> as the Wotiak, for Steel. Possibly these are essentially the
      same with <em>Hundwáníy</em> and <em>Alhinde</em>, pointing to India as the original
      source of supply. [In the <cite>Sikandar Nāma,e Bará</cite> (or “Book of Alexander
      the Great,” written <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1200, by Abū Muhammad bin Yusuf bin
      Mu,Ayyid-i-Nizāmu-’d-Dīn), translated by Captain H. Wilberforce Clarke (Lond.,
      1881, large 8vo), steel is frequently mentioned: Canto xix. 257, p. 202;
      xx. 12, p. 211; xlv. 38, p. 567; lviii. 32, pp. 695, 42, pp. 697, 62, 66,
      pp. 699; lix. 28, p. 703.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Avicenna, in his fifth book <cite>De Animâ</cite>, according to Roger Bacon,
      distinguishes three very different species of iron: “1st. Iron which is
      good for striking or bearing heavy strokes, and for being forged by hammer
      and fire, but not for cutting-tools. Of this hammers and anvils are made,
      and this is what we commonly call <em>Iron</em> simply. 2nd. That which is purer,
      has more heat in it, and is better adapted to take an edge and to form
      cutting-tools, but is not so malleable, viz. <em>Steel</em>. And the 3rd is that
      which is called <span class="smcap">Andena</span>. This is less known among the Latin nations. Its
      special character is that like silver it is malleable and ductile under a
      very low degree of heat. In other properties it is intermediate between
      iron and steel.” (<cite>Fr. R. Baconis Opera Inedita</cite>, 1859, pp. 382–383.) The
      same passage, apparently, of Avicenna is quoted by Vincent of Beauvais,
      but with considerable differences. (See <cite>Speculum Naturale</cite>, VII. ch.
      lii. lx., and <cite>Specul. Doctrinale</cite>, XV. ch. lxiii.) The latter author
      writes <em>Alidena</em>, and I have not been able to refer to Avicenna, so that
      I am doubtful whether his <em>Andena</em> is the same term with the <em>Andaine</em> of
      Pauthier and our <em>Ondanique</em>.</p>

    <p>The popular view, at least in the Middle Ages, seems to have regarded
      <em>Steel</em> as a distinct natural species, the product of a necessarily
      different <em>ore</em>, from iron; and some such view is, I suspect, still common
      in the East. An old Indian officer told me of the reply of a native friend
      to whom he had tried to explain the conversion of iron into steel—“What!
      You would have me believe that if I put an ass into the furnace it will
      come forth a horse.” And Indian Steel again seems to have been regarded
      as a distinct natural species from ordinary steel. It is in fact made by
      a peculiar but simple process, by which the iron is converted <em>directly</em>
      into cast-steel, without passing through any intermediate stage analogous
      to that of <em>blister-steel</em>. When specimens were first examined in England,
      chemists concluded that the steel was made direct from the <em>ore</em>. The
      <em>Ondanique</em> of Marco no doubt was a fine steel resembling the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>Indian
      article. (<cite>Müller’s Ctesias</cite>, p. 80; <cite>Curtius</cite>, IX. 24; <cite>Müller’s Geog. Gr.

    <p><a id="Note_XVII14" href="#NoteAnchor_XVII14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—Paulus Jovius in the 16th century says, I know not on what
      authority, that Kermán was then celebrated for the fine temper of its steel
      in scimitars and lance-points. These were eagerly bought at high prices
      by the Turks, and their quality was such that one blow of a Kermán sabre
      would cleave an European helmet without turning the edge. And I see that
      the phrase, “Kermání blade” is used in poetry by Marco’s contemporary Amír
      Khusrú of Delhi. (<cite>P. Jov. Hist. of his own Time</cite>, Bk. XIV.; <cite>Elliot</cite>, III. 537.)</p>

    <p>There is, or was in Pottinger’s time, still a great manufacture of
      <em>matchlocks</em> at Kermán; but rose-water, shawls, and carpets are the staples
      of the place now. Polo says nothing that points to shawl-making, but it
      would seem from Edrisi that some such manufacture already existed in the
      adjoining district of Bamm. It is possible that the “hangings” spoken of by
      Polo may refer to the carpets. I have seen a genuine Kermán carpet in the
      house of my friend, Sir Bartle Frere. It is of very short pile, very even
      and dense; the design, a combination of vases, birds, and floral tracery,
      closely resembling the illuminated frontispiece of some Persian MSS.</p>

    <p>The shawls are inferior to those of Kashmir in exquisite softness, but
      scarcely in delicacy of texture and beauty of design. In 1850, their
      highest quality did not exceed 30 <em>tomans</em> (14<i>l.</i>) in price. About 2200
      looms were employed on the fabric. A good deal of Kermán wool called
      <em>Kurk</em>, goes <i>viâ</i> Bandar Abbási and Karáchi to Amritsar, where it is mixed
      with the genuine Tibetan wool in the shawl manufacture. Several of the
      articles named in the text, including <em>pardahs</em> (“cortines”) are woven in
      shawl-fabric. I scarcely think, however, that Marco would have confounded
      woven shawl with needle embroidery. And Mr. Khanikoff states that the silk
      embroidery, of which Marco speaks, is still performed with great skill and
      beauty at Kermán. Our cut illustrates the textures figured with animals,
      already noticed at <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>.</p>

    <p>The Guebers were numerous here at the end of last century, but they
      are rapidly disappearing now. The Musulman of Kermán is, according to
      Khanikoff, an epicurean gentleman, and even in regard to wine, which is
      strong and plentiful, his divines are liberal. “In other parts of Persia
      you find the scribblings on the walls of Serais to consist of philosophical
      axioms, texts from the Koran, or abuse of local authorities. From Kermán to
      Yezd you find only rhymes in praise of fair ladies or good wine.”</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVII15" href="#NoteAnchor_XVII15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—Parez is famous for its falcons still, and so are the districts of
      Aktár and Sirján. Both Mr. Abbott and Major Smith were entertained with
      hawking by Persian hosts in this neighbourhood. The late Sir O. St. John
      identifies the bird described as the <i>Sháhín</i> (Falco <i>Peregrinator</i>), one
      variety of which, the <i>Fársi</i>, is abundant in the higher mountains of S.
      Persia. It is now little used in that region, the <i>Terlán</i> or goshawk being
      most valued, but a few are caught and sent for sale to the Arabs of Oman.
      (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXV. 50, 63, and <cite>Major St. John’s Notes</cite>.)</p>

    <p>[“The fine falcons, ‘with red breasts and swift of flight,’ come from
      Páríz. They are, however, very scarce, two or three only being caught
      every year. A well-trained Páríz falcon costs from 30 to 50 tomans (12<i>l.</i>
      to 20<i>l.</i>), as much as a good horse.” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 491.)
      Major Sykes, <cite>Persia</cite>, ch. xxiii., writes: “Marco Polo was evidently a keen
      sportsman, and his description of the <em>Sháhin</em>, as it is termed, cannot be
      improved upon.” Major Sykes has a list given him by a Khán of seven hawks
      of the province, all black and white, except the <em>Sháhin</em>, which has yellow
      eyes, and is the third in the order of size.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the City of Camadi and its Ruins; also touching the Carauna Robbers.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> you have ridden down hill those two days, you find yourself in a vast
    plain, and at the beginning thereof there is a city called <span class="smcap">Camadi</span>, which
    formerly was a great and noble place, but now is of little consequence, for
    the Tartars in their incursions have several times ravaged it. The plain
    whereof I speak is a very hot region; and the province that we now enter is
    called <span class="smcap">Reobarles</span>.</p>

  <p>The fruits of the country are dates, pistachioes, and apples of Paradise,
    with others of the like not found in our cold climate. [There are vast
    numbers of turtledoves, attracted by the abundance of fruits, but the
    Saracens never take them, for they hold them in abomination.] And on this
    plain there is a kind of bird called francolin, but different from the
    francolin of other countries, for their colour is a mixture of black and
    white, and the feet and beak are vermilion colour.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIII11" href="#Note_XVIII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>The beasts also are peculiar; and first I will tell you of their oxen.
    These are very large, and all over white as snow; the hair is very short
    and smooth, which is owing to the heat of the country. The horns are short
    and thick, not sharp in the point; and between the shoulders they have a
    round hump some two palms high. There are no handsomer creatures in the
    world. And when they have to be loaded, they kneel like the camel; once the
    load is adjusted, they rise. Their load is a heavy one, for they are very
    strong animals. Then there are sheep here as big as asses; and their tails
    are so large and fat, that one tail shall weigh some 30 lbs. They are fine
    fat beasts, and afford capital mutton.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIII12" href="#Note_XVIII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

  <p>In this plain there are a number of villages and towns which have lofty
    walls of mud, made as a defence against the banditti,<a id="NoteAnchor_XVIII13" href="#Note_XVIII13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> who are very
    numerous, and are called <span class="smcap">Caraonas</span>. This name is given them because they
    are the sons of Indian mothers by Tartar fathers. And you must know that
    when these Caraonas wish to make a plundering incursion, they have certain
    devilish enchantments whereby they do bring darkness over the face of day,
    insomuch that you can scarcely discern your comrade riding beside you;
    and this darkness they will cause to extend over a space of seven days’
    journey. They know the country thoroughly, and ride abreast, keeping near
    one another, sometimes to the number of 10,000, at other times more or
    fewer. In this way they extend across the whole plain that they are going
    to harry, and catch every living thing that is found outside of the towns
    and villages; man, woman, or beast, nothing can escape them! The old men
    whom they take in this way they butcher; the young men and the women they
    sell for slaves in other countries; thus the whole land is ruined, and has
    become well-nigh a desert.</p>

  <p>The King of these scoundrels is called <span class="smcap">Nogodar</span>. This Nogodar had gone to
    the Court of Chagatai, who was own brother to the Great Kaan, with some
    10,000 horsemen of his, and abode with him; for Chagatai was his uncle. And
    whilst there this Nogodar devised a most audacious enterprise, and I will
    tell you what it was. He left his uncle who was then in Greater Armenia,
    and fled with a great body of horsemen, cruel unscrupulous fellows, first
    through <span class="smcap">Badashan</span>, and then through another province called <span class="smcap">Pashai-Dir</span>,
    and then through another called <span class="smcap">Ariora-Keshemur</span>. There he lost a great
    number of his people and of his horses, for the roads were very narrow and
    perilous. And when he had conquered all those provinces, he entered India
    at the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>extremity of a province called <span class="smcap">Dalivar</span>. He established himself in
    that city and government, which he took from the King of the country,

    off and threw himself into a village that was hard by, called <span class="smcap">Conosalmi</span>.

    <p><a id="Note_XVIII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Ramusio has “Adam’s apple” for apples of Paradise. This was some
      kind of <em>Citrus</em>, though Lindley thinks it impossible to say precisely
      what. According to Jacques de Vitry it was a beautiful fruit of the Citron
      kind, in which the bite of human teeth was plainly discernible. (Note
      to <cite>Vulgar Errors</cite>, II. 211; <cite>Bongars</cite>, I. 1099.) Mr. Abbott speaks of
      this tract as “the districts (of Kermán) lying towards the South, which
      are termed the Ghermseer or Hot Region, where the temperature of winter
      resembles that of a charming spring, and where the palm, orange, and
      lemon-tree flourish.” (<cite>MS. Report</cite>; see also <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXV. 56.)</p>

    <p>[“Marco Polo’s apples of Paradise are more probably the fruits of the Konár
      tree. There are no plantains in that part of the country. Turtle doves, now
      as then, are plentiful, and as they are seldom shot, and are said by the
      people to be unwholesome food, we can understand Marco Polo’s saying that
      the people do not eat them.” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> pp. 492–493.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The Francolin here spoken of is, as Major Smith tells me, the <em>Darráj</em> of
      the Persians, the <em>Black Partridge</em> of English sportsmen, sometimes called
      the Red-legged Francolin. The Darráj is found in some parts of Egypt, where
      its peculiar call is interpreted by the peasantry into certain Arabic
      words, meaning “Sweet are the corn-ears! Praised be the Lord!” In India,
      Baber tells us, the call of the Black Partridge was (less piously) rendered
      “<em>Shír dáram shakrak</em>,” “I’ve got milk and sugar!” The bird seems to be
      the <span lang="el">ἀτταγὰς</span> of Athenaeus, a fowl “speckled like the partridge,
      but larger,” found in Egypt and Lydia. The Greek version of its cry is the
      best of all: “<span lang="el">τρìς τοῖς κακούργοις κακά</span>” (“Threefold ills to the
      ill-doers!”). This is really like the call of the black partridge in India
      as I recollect it. [<cite>Tetrao francolinus</cite>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVIII12" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—Abbott mentions the humped (though small) oxen in this part of
      Persia, and that in some of the neighbouring districts they are taught to
      kneel to receive the load, an accomplishment which seems to have struck
      Mas’udi (III. 27), who says he saw it exhibited by oxen at Rai (near
      modern Tehran). The Aín Akbari also ascribes it to a very fine breed in
      Bengal. The whimsical name <em>Zebu</em>, given to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>humped or Indian ox in
      books of Zoology, was taken by Buffon from the exhibitors of such a beast
      at a French Fair, who probably invented it. That the humped breeds of oxen
      existed in this part of Asia in ancient times is shown by sculptures at
      Kouyunjik. (See cut below.)</p>

    <p>A letter from Agassiz, printed in the Proc. As. Soc. Bengal (1865), refers
      to wild “zebus,” and calls the species a small one. There is no wild
      “zebu,” and some of the breeds are of enormous size.</p>

    <p>[“White oxen, with short thick horns and a round hump between the
      shoulders, are now very rare between Kermán and Bender ’Abbás. They are,
      however, still to be found towards Belúchistán and Mekrán, and they kneel
      to be loaded like camels. The sheep which I saw had fine large tails; I
      did not, however, hear of any having so high a weight as thirty pounds.”
      (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 493.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The fat-tailed sheep is well known in many parts of Asia and part of
      Africa. It is mentioned by Ctesias, and by Ælian, who says the shepherds
      used to extract the tallow from the live animal, sewing up the tail again;
      exactly the same story is told by the Chinese Pliny, Ma Twan-lin. Marco’s
      statements as to size do not surpass those of the admirable Kämpfer: “In
      size they so much surpass the common sheep that it is not unusual to see
      them as tall as a donkey, whilst all are much more than three feet; and
      as to the tail I shall not exceed the truth, though I may exceed belief,
      if I say that it sometimes reaches 40 lbs. in weight.” Captain Hutton was
      assured by an Afghan sheep-master that tails had occurred in his flocks
      weighing 12 Tabriz <em>mans</em>, upwards of 76 lbs.! The Afghans use the fat
      as an aperient, swallowing a dose of 4 to 6 lbs! Captain Hutton’s friend
      testified that trucks to bear the sheep-tails were sometimes used among
      the Taimúnis (north of Herat). This may help to locate that ancient and
      slippery story. Josafat Barbaro says he had seen the thing, but is vague as
      to place. (<cite>Ælian Nat. An.</cite> III. 3, IV. 32; <cite>Amoen. Exoticae; Ferrier</cite>, H.

    <p>The <span class="smcap">Ḳaraunahs</span> are mentioned often in the histories of the Mongol regime in
      Persia, first as a Mongol tribe forming a <em>Tuman</em>, <i>i.e.</i> a division or corps
      of 10,000 in the Mongol army (and I suspect it was the phrase the <em>Tuman
      of the Ḳaraunahs</em> in Marco’s mind that suggested his repeated use of the
      number 10,000 in speaking of them); and afterwards as daring and savage
      freebooters, scouring the Persian provinces, and having their headquarters
      on the Eastern frontiers of Persia. They are described as having had their
      original seats on the mountains north of the Chinese wall near <em>Ḳaraún
      Jidun</em> or <em>Khidun</em>; and their special accomplishment in war was the use of
      Naphtha Fire. Rashiduddin mentions the <em>Ḳaránut</em> as a branch of the great
      Mongol tribe of the Kunguráts, who certainly had their seat in the vicinity
      named, so these may possibly be connected with the Ḳaraunahs. The same
      author says that the Tuman of the Ḳaraunahs formed the <em>Injú</em> or <em>peculium</em>
      of Arghún Khan.</p>

    <p>Wassáf calls them “a kind of goblins rather than human beings, the most
      daring of all the Mongols”; and Mirkhond speaks in like terms.</p>

    <p>Dr. Bird of Bombay, in discussing some of the Indo-Scythic coins which bear
      the word <em>Korano</em> attached to the prince’s name, asserts this to stand
      for the name of the Ḳaraunah, “who were a Græco-Indo-Scythic tribe of
      robbers in the Punjab, who are mentioned by Marco Polo,” a somewhat hasty
      conclusion which Pauthier adopts. There is, Quatremère observes, no mention
      of the Ḳaraunahs before the Mongol invasion, and this he regards as the
      great obstacle to any supposition of their having been a people previously
      settled in Persia. Reiske, indeed, with no reference to the present
      subject, quotes a passage from Hamza of Ispahan, a writer of the 10th
      century, in which mention is made of certain troops called <em>Ḳaráunahs</em>. But
      it seems certain that in this and other like cases the real reading was
      <em>Kazáwinah</em>, people of Kazvin. (See <cite>Reiske’s Constant. Porphyrog.</cite> Bonn.
      ed. II. 674; <cite>Gottwaldt’s Hamza Ispahanensis</cite>, p. 161; and <cite>Quatremère</cite>
      in <cite>J. A.</cite> sér. V. tom. xv. 173.) Ibn Batuta only once mentions the
      name, saying that Tughlak Sháh of Dehli was “one of those Turks called
      <em>Ḳaráunas</em> who dwell in the mountains between Sind and Turkestan.” Hammer
      has suggested the derivation of the word <em>Carbine</em> from <em>Karáwinah</em> (as
      he writes), and a link in such an etymology is perhaps furnished by the
      fact that in the 16th century the word <em>Carbine</em> was used for some kind of
      irregular horseman.</p>

    <p>As regards the account given by Marco of the origin of the Caraonas, it
      seems almost necessarily a mistaken one. As Khanikoff remarks, he might
      have confounded them with the Biluchis, whose Turanian aspect (at least as
      regards the Brahuis) shows a strong infusion of Turki blood, and who might
      be rudely described as a cross between Tartars and Indians. It is indeed
      an odd fact that the word <em>Karáni</em> (vulgo <em>Cranny</em>) is commonly applied in
      India at this day to the mixed race sprung from European fathers and Native
      mothers, and this might be cited in corroboration of Marsden’s reference to
      the Sanskrit <em>Karana</em>, but I suspect the coincidence arises in another way.
      <em>Karana</em> is the name applied to a particular class of mixt blood, whose
      special occupation was writing and accounts. But the prior sense of the
      word seems to have been “clever, skilled,” and hence a writer or scribe. In
      this sense we find <em>Karáni</em> applied in Ibn Batuta’s day to a ship’s clerk,
      and it is used in the same sense in the <em>Aín Akbari</em>. Clerkship is also
      the predominant occupation of the East-Indians, and hence the term Karáni
      is applied to them from their business, and not from their mixt blood. We
      shall see hereafter that there is a Tartar term <em>Arghún</em>, applied to fair
      children born of a Mongol mother and <em>white</em> father; it is possible that
      there may have been a correlative word like <em>Ḳaráun</em> (from <em>Ḳará</em>, black)
      applied to dark children born of Mongol father and black mother, and that
      this led Marco to a false theory.</p>

    <p>[Major Sykes (<cite>Persia</cite>) devotes a chapter (xxiv.) to <cite>The Karwán
      Expedition</cite> in which he says: “Is it not possible that the Karwánis are the
      Caraonas of Marco Polo? They are distinct from the surrounding Baluchis,
      and pay no tribute.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    </div>

    <p>Let us turn now to the name of Nogodar. Contemporaneously with the
      Ḳaraunahs we have frequent mention of predatory bands known as <em>Nigúdaris</em>,
      who seem to be distinguished from the Ḳaraunahs, but had a like character
      for truculence. Their headquarters were about Sijistán, and Quatremère
      seems disposed to look upon them as a tribe indigenous in that quarter.
      Hammer says they were originally the troops of Prince Nigudar, grandson of
      Chaghatai, and that they were a rabble of all sorts, Mongols, Turkmans,
      Kurds, Shúls, and what not. We hear of their revolts and disorders down to
      1319, under which date Mirkhond says that there had been one-and-twenty
      fights with them in four years. Again we hear of them in 1336 about Herat,
      whilst in Baber’s time they turn up as <em>Nukdari</em>, fairly established as
      tribes in the mountainous tracts of Karnúd and Ghúr, west of Kabul, and
      coupled with the Hazáras, who still survive both in name and character.
      “Among both,” says Baber, “there are some who speak the Mongol language.”
      Hazáras and <em>Takdaris</em> (read <em>Nukdaris</em>) again occur coupled in the
      <cite>History of Sind</cite>. (See <cite>Elliot</cite>, I. 303–304.) [On the struggle against
      Timur of Toumen, veteran chief of the Nikoudrians (1383–84), see Major
      David Price’s <cite>Mahommedan History</cite>, London, 1821, vol. iii. pp. 47–49, H.&nbsp;C.]
      In maps of the 17th century, as of Hondius and Blaeuw, we find the
      mountains north of Kabul termed <em>Nochdarizari</em>, in which we cannot miss
      the combination Nigudar-Hazárah, whencesoever it was got. The Hazáras are
      eminently Mongol in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>feature to this day, and it is very probable that they
      or some part of them are the descendants of the Ḳaráunahs or the Nigudaris,
      or of both, and that the origination of the bands so called, from the
      scum of the Mongol inundation, is thus in degree confirmed. The Hazáras
      generally are said to speak an old dialect of Persian. But one tribe in
      Western Afghanistan retains both the name of Mongols and a language of
      which six-sevenths (judging from a vocabulary published by Major Leech)
      appear to be Mongol. Leech says, too, that the Hazáras generally are termed
      <em>Moghals</em> by the Ghilzais. It is worthy of notice that Abu’l Fázl, who also
      mentions the Nukdaris among the nomad tribes of Kabul, says the Hazáras
      were the remains of the Chaghataian army which Mangu Kaan sent to the aid
      of Hulaku, under the command of Nigudar Oghlan. (<cite>Not. et Ext.</cite> XIV. 284;
      <cite>Ilch.</cite> I. 284, 309, etc,; <cite>Baber</cite>, 134, 136, 140; <cite>J. As.</cite> sér. IV. tom.
      iv. 98; <cite>Ayeen Akbery</cite>, II. 192–193.)</p>

    <p>So far, excepting as to the doubtful point of the relation between
      Ḳaráunahs and Nigudaris, and as to the origin of the former, we have a
      general accordance with Polo’s representations. But it is not very easy to
      identify with certainty the inroad on India to which he alludes, or the
      person intended by Nogodar, nephew of Chaghatai. It seems as if two persons
      of that name had each contributed something to Marco’s history.</p>

    <p>We find in Hammer and D’Ohsson that one of the causes which led to the war
      between Barka Khan and Hulaku in 1262 (see above, <cite>Prologue</cite>, ch. ii.)
      was the violent end that had befallen three princes of the House of Juji,
      who had accompanied Hulaku to Persia in command of the contingent of that
      House. When war actually broke out, the contingent made their escape from
      Persia. One party gained Kipchak by way of Derbend; another, in greater
      force, led by <span class="smcap">Nigudar</span> and Onguja, escaped to Khorasan, pursued by the
      troops of Hulaku, and thence eastward, where they seized upon Ghazni and
      other districts bordering on India.</p>

    <p>But again: Nigudar Aghul, or Oghlan, son of (the younger) Juji, son of
      <em>Chaghatai</em>, was the leader of the Chaghataian contingent in Hulaku’s
      expedition, and was still attached to the Mongol-Persian army in 1269, when
      Borrak Khan, of the House of Chaghatai, was meditating war against his
      kinsman, Abaka of Persia. Borrak sent to the latter an ambassador, who was
      the bearer of a secret message to Prince Nigudar, begging him not to serve
      against the head of his own House. Nigudar, upon this, made a pretext of
      retiring to his own headquarters in <em>Georgia</em>, hoping to reach Borrak’s
      camp by way of Derbend. He was, however, intercepted, and lost many of
      his people. With 1000 horse he took refuge in Georgia, but was refused an
      asylum, and was eventually captured by Abaka’s commander on that frontier.
      His officers were executed, his troops dispersed among Abaka’s army, and
      his own life spared under surveillance. I find no more about him. In 1278
      Hammer speaks of him as dead, and of the Nigudarian bands as having been
      formed out of his troops. But authority is not given.</p>

    <p>The second Nigudar is evidently the one to whom Abu’l Fázl alludes.
      Khanikoff assumes that the Nigudar who went off towards India about 1260
      (he puts the date earlier) was Nigudar, the grandson of Chaghatai, but he
      takes no notice of the second story just quoted.</p>

    <p>In the former story we have bands under <em>Nigudar</em> going off by Ghazni, <em>and
      conquering country on the Indian frontier</em>. In the latter we have <em>Nigudar,
      a descendant of Chaghatai</em>, trying to escape from his camp <em>on the frontier
      of Great Armenia</em>. Supposing the Persian historians to be correct, it looks
      as if Marco had rolled two stories into one.</p>

    <p>Some other passages may be cited before quitting this part of the subject.
      A chronicle of Herat, translated by Barbier de Meynard, says, under 1298:
      “The King Fakhruddin (of Herat) had the imprudence to authorise <em>the
      Amir Nigudar</em> to establish himself in a quarter of the city, with 300
      adventurers from ’Irák. This little troop made frequent raids in Kuhistan,
      Sijistan, Farrah, etc., spreading terror. Khodabanda, at the request of his
      brother Ghazan Khan, came from Mazanderan to demand the immediate surrender
      of these brigands,” etc. And in the account of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>tremendous foray of the
      Chaghataian Prince Kotlogh Shah, on the east and south of Persia in 1299,
      we find one of his captains called <em>Nigudar</em> Bahadur. (<cite>Gold. Horde</cite>, 146,
      157, 164; <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, IV. 378 <i>seqq.</i>, 433 <i>seqq.</i>, 513 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Ilch.</cite> I. 216,

    <p>As regards the route taken by Prince Nogodar in his incursion into India,
      we have no difficulty with <span class="smcap">Badakhshan</span>. <span class="smcap">Pashai-Dir</span> is a copulate name; the
      former part, as we shall see reason to believe hereafter, representing the
      country between the Hindu Kush and the Kabul River (see <i>infra</i>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XXX1">ch. xxx.</a>);
      the latter (as Pauthier already has pointed out), <span class="smcap">Dir</span>, the chief town of
      Panjkora, in the hill country north of Peshawar. In <cite>Ariora-Keshemur</cite>
      the first portion only is perplexing. I will mention the most probable
      of the solutions that have occurred to me, and a second, due to that
      eminent archæologist, General A. Cunningham. (1) <em>Ariora</em> may be some
      corrupt or Mongol form of <em>Aryavartta</em>, a sacred name applied to the
      Holy Lands of Indian Buddhism, of which Kashmir was eminently one to the
      Northern Buddhists. <em>Oron</em>, in Mongol, is a Region or Realm, and may have
      taken the place of <em>Vartta</em>, giving <em>Aryoron</em> or Ariora. (2) “<em>Ariora</em>,”
      General Cunningham writes, “I take to be the <em>Harhaura</em> of Sanscrit—<i>i.e.</i>
      the Western Panjáb. Harhaura was the North-Western Division of the <em>Nava-Khanda</em>,
      or Nine Divisions of Ancient India. It is mentioned between
      <em>Sindhu-Sauvira</em> in the west (<i>i.e.</i> Sind), and <em>Madra</em> in the north (<i>i.e.</i>
      the Eastern Panjáb, which is still called <em>Madar-Des</em>). The name of
      Harhaura is, I think, preserved in the Haro River. Now, the Sind-Sagor
      Doab formed a portion of the kingdom of Kashmir, and the joint names,
      like those of Sindhu-Sauvira, describe only one State.” The names of the
      Nine Divisions in question are given by the celebrated astronomer, Varaha
      Mihira, who lived in the beginning of the 6th century, and are repeated by
      Al Biruni. (See <cite>Reinaud, Mém. sur l’Inde</cite>, p. 116.) The only objection to
      this happy solution seems to lie in Al Biruni’s remark, that the names in
      question were in general no longer used even in his time (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1030).</p>

    <p>There can be no doubt that <em>Asidin Soldan</em> is, as Khanikoff has said,
      Ghaiassuddin Balban, Sultan of Delhi from 1266 to 1286, and for years
      before that a man of great power in India, and especially in the Panjáb, of
      which he had in the reign of Ruknuddin (1236) held independent possession.</p>

    <p>Firishta records several inroads of Mongols in the Panjáb during the
      reign of Ghaiassuddin, in withstanding one of which that King’s eldest
      son was slain; and there are constant indications of their presence in
      Sind till the end of the century. But we find in that historian no hint of
      the chief circumstances of this part of the story, viz., the conquest of
      Kashmir and the occupation of <em>Dalivar</em> or <em>Dilivar</em> (G.&nbsp;T.), evidently
      (whatever its identity) in the plains of India. I do find, however, in the
      history of Kashmir, as given by Lassen (III. 1138), that in the end of
      1259, Lakshamana Deva, King of Kashmir, was killed in a campaign against
      the <em>Turushka</em> (Turks or Tartars), and that their leader, who is called
      Kajjala, got hold of the country and held it till 1287.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is difficult
      not to connect this both with Polo’s story and with the escapade of Nigudar
      about 1260, noting also that this occupation of Kashmir extended through
      the whole reign of Ghaiassuddin.</p>

    <p>We seem to have a memory of Polo’s story preserved in one of Elliot’s
      extracts from Wassáf, which states that in 708 (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1308), after a great
      defeat of a Mongol inroad which had passed the Ganges, Sultan Ala’uddin
      Khilji ordered a pillar of Mongol heads to be raised before the Badáun
      gate, “<em>as was done with the</em> Nigudari <em>Moghuls</em>” (III. 48).</p>

    <p>We still have to account for the occupation and locality of <em>Dalivar</em>;
      Marsden supposed it to be <em>Lahore</em>; Khanikoff considers it to be <em>Diráwal</em>,
      the ancient desert capital of the Bhattis, properly (according to Tod)
      <em>Deoráwal</em>, but by a transposition common in India, as it is in Italy,
      sometimes called <em>Diláwar</em>, in the modern State of Bháwalpúr. But General
      Cunningham suggests a more probable locality in <span class="smcap">Diláwar</span> on the west bank
      of the Jelam, close to Dárápúr, and opposite to Mung. These two <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>sites,
      Diláwar-Dárápúr on the west bank, and Mung on the east, are identified
      by General Cunningham (I believe justly) with Alexander’s Bucephala and
      Nicaea. The spot, which is just opposite the battlefield of Chiliánwála,
      was visited (15th December, 1868) at my request, by my friend Colonel
      R. Maclagan, R.E. He writes: “The present village of Diláwar stands a
      little above the town of Dárápúr (I mean on higher ground), looking down
      on Dárápúr and on the river, and on the cultivated and wooded plain
      along the river bank. The remains of the Old Diláwar, in the form of
      quantities of large bricks, cover the low round-backed spurs and knolls
      of the broken rocky hills around the present village, but principally on
      the land side. They cover a large area of very irregular character, and
      may clearly be held to represent a very considerable town. There are no
      indications of the form of buildings, ... but simply large quantities of
      large bricks, which for a long time have been carried away and used for
      modern buildings.... After rain coins are found on the surface.... There
      can be no doubt of a very large extent of ground, of very irregular and
      uninviting character, having been covered at some time with buildings. The
      position on the Jelam would answer well for the Diláwar which the Mongol
      invaders took and held.... The strange thing is that the name should not
      be mentioned (I believe it is not) by any of the well-known Mahomedan
      historians of India. So much for Diláwar.... The people have no traditions.
      But there are the remains; and there is the name, borne by the existing
      village on part of the old site.” I had come to the conclusion that this
      was almost certainly Polo’s Dalivar, and had mapped it as such, before I
      read certain passages in the <cite>History of Zíyáuddín Barni</cite>, which have been
      translated by Professor Dowson for the third volume of Elliot’s <cite>India</cite>.
      When the comrades of Ghaiassuddin Balban urged him to conquests, the
      Sultan pointed to the constant danger from the Mongols,<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> saying: “These
      accursed wretches have heard of the wealth and condition of Hindustan, and
      have set their hearts upon conquering and plundering it. <em>They have taken
      and plundered Lahor within my territories, and no year passes that they
      do not come here and plunder the villages</em>.... They even talk about the
      conquest and sack of Delhi.” And under a later date the historian says:
      “The Sultan ... marched to Lahor, and ordered the rebuilding of the fort
      which the Mughals had destroyed in the reigns of the sons of Shamsuddin.
      The towns and villages of Lahor which the Mughals had devastated and laid
      waste he repeopled.” Considering these passages, and the fact that Polo had
      no personal knowledge of Upper India, I now think it probable that Marsden
      was right, and that <em>Dilivar</em> is really a misunderstanding of “<em>Città</em> di
      Livar” for <em>Lahàwar</em> or Lahore.</p>

    <p>The <em>Magical darkness</em> which Marco ascribes to the evil arts of the
      Karaunas is explained by Khanikoff from the phenomenon of <em>Dry Fog</em>, which
      he has often experienced in Khorasan, combined with the <em>Dust Storm</em> with
      which we are familiar in Upper India. In Sind these phenomena often produce
      a great degree of darkness. During a battle fought between the armies of
      Sindh and Kachh in 1762, such a fog came on, obscuring the light of day for
      some six hours, during which the armies were intermixed with one another
      and fighting desperately. When the darkness dispersed they separated, and
      the consternation of both parties was so great at the events of the day
      that both made a precipitate retreat. In 1844 this battle was still spoken
      of with wonder. (<cite>J. Bomb. Br. R. A. S.</cite> I. 423.)</p>

    <p>Major St. John has given a note on his own experience of these curious
      Kermán fogs (see <cite>Ocean Highways</cite>, 1872, p. 286): “Not a breath of air was
      stirring, and the whole effect was most curious, and utterly unlike any
      other fog I have seen. No deposit of dust followed, and the feeling of the
      air was decidedly damp. I unfortunately could not get my hygrometer till
      the fog had cleared away.”</p>

    <p>[<em>General Houtum-Schindler</em>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 493, writes: “The magical darkness
      might, as Colonel Yule supposes, be explained by the curious dry fogs or
      dust storms, often occurring in the neighbourhood of Kermán, but it must be
      remarked that Marco Polo <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>was caught in one of these storms down in Jíruft,
      where, according to the people I questioned, such storms now never occur.
      On the 29th of September, 1879, at Kermán, a high wind began to blow from
      S.S.W. at about 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> First there came thick heavy clouds of dust with a
      few drops of rain. The heavy dust then settled down, the lighter particles
      remained in the air, forming a dry fog of such density that large objects,
      like houses, trees, etc., could not even faintly be distinguished at a
      distance of a hundred paces. The barometers suffered no change, the three
      I had with me remained in <em>statu quo</em>.” “The heat is over by the middle of
      September, and after the autumnal equinox, there are a few days of what is
      best described as a dense dry fog. This was undoubtedly the haze referred
      to by Marco Polo.” (<cite>Major Sykes</cite>, ch. iv.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Richthofen’s remarkable exposition of the phenomena of the <em>löss</em> in North
      China, and of the sub-aerial deposits of the steppes and of Central Asia
      throws some light on this. But this hardly applies to St John’s experience
      of “no deposit of dust.” (See Richthofen, <cite>China</cite>, pp. 96–97 s. <cite>MS. Note</cite>,
      H.&nbsp;Y.)</p>

    <p>The belief that such opportune phenomena were produced by enchantment was
      a thoroughly Tartar one. D’Herbelot relates (art. <cite>Giagathai</cite>) that in an
      action with a rebel called Mahomed Tarabi, the Mongols were encompassed by
      a dust storm which they attributed to enchantment on the part of the enemy,
      and it so discouraged them that they took to flight.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVIII15" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIII15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—The specification that only <em>seven</em> were saved from Marco’s company
      is peculiar to Pauthier’s Text, not appearing in the G.&nbsp;T.</p>

    <p>Several names compounded of <em>Salm</em> or <em>Salmi</em> occur on the dry lands on
      the borders of Kermán. Edrisi, however (I. p. 428), names a place called
      <span class="smcap">Ḳanát-ul-Shám</span> as the first march in going from Jíruft to Walashjird.
      Walashjird is, I imagine, represented by <em>Galashkird</em>, Major R. Smith’s
      third march from Jíruft (see my Map of Routes from Kermán to Hormuz); and
      as such an indication agrees with the view taken below of Polo’s route,
      I am strongly disposed to identify Ḳanát-ul-Shám with his <em>castello</em> or
      walled village of <em>Canosalmi</em>.</p>

    <p>[“Marco Polo’s Conosalmi, where he was attacked by robbers and lost the
      greater part of his men, is perhaps the ruined town or village Kamasal
      (Kahn-i-asal = the honey canal), near Kahnúj-i-pancheh and Vakílábád in
      Jíruft. It lies on the direct road between Shehr-i-Daqíánús (Camadi) and
      the Nevergún Pass. The road goes in an almost due southerly direction.
      The Nevergún Pass accords with Marco Polo’s description of it; it is very
      difficult, on account of the many great blocks of sandstone scattered upon
      it. Its proximity to the Bashakird mountains and Mekrán easily accounts for
      the prevalence of robbers, who infested the place in Marco Polo’s time. At
      the end of the Pass lies the large village Shamíl, with an old fort; the
      distance thence to the site of Hormúz or Bender ’Abbás (lying more to the
      west) is 52 miles, two days’ march. The climate of Bender ’Abbás is very
      bad, strangers speedily fall sick, two of my men died there, all the others
      were seriously ill.” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> pp. 495–496.) Major Sykes
      (ch. xxiii.) says: “Two marches from Camadi was Kahn-i-Panchur, and a stage
      beyond it lay the ruins of Fariáb or Pariáb, which was once a great city,
      and was destroyed by a flood, according to local legend. It may have been
      Alexander’s Salmous, as it is about the right distance from the coast, and
      if so, could not have been Marco’s <em>Cono Salmi</em>. Continuing on, Galashkird
      mentioned by Edrisi, is the next stage.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The raids of the Mekranis and Biluchis long preceded those of the Karaunas,
      for they were notable even in the time of Mahmud of Ghazni, and they have
      continued to our own day to be prosecuted nearly on the same stage and in
      the same manner. About 1721, 4000 horsemen of this description plundered
      the town of Bander Abbási, whilst Captain Alex. Hamilton was in the port;
      and Abbott, in 1850, found the dread of Bilúch robbers to extend almost to
      the gates of Ispahan. A striking account of the Bilúch robbers and their
      characteristics is given by General Ferrier. (See <cite>Hamilton</cite>, I. 109;
      <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXV.; <cite>Khanikoff’s Mémoire; Macd. Kinneir</cite>, 196; <cite>Caravan

  <div class="subh4">Of the Descent to the City of Hormos.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Plain of which we have spoken extends in a southerly direction for
    five days’ journey, and then you come to another descent some twenty miles
    in length, where the road is very bad and full of peril, for there are
    many robbers and bad characters about. When you have got to the foot of
    this descent you find another beautiful plain called the <span class="smcap">Plain of Formosa</span>.
    This extends for two days’ journey; and you find in it fine streams of
    water with plenty of date-palms and other fruit-trees. There are also many
    beautiful birds, francolins, popinjays, and other kinds such as we have
    none of in our country. When you have ridden these two days you come to the
    Ocean Sea, and on the shore you find a city with a harbour which is called
    <span class="smcap">Hormos</span>.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIX11" href="#Note_XIX11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> Merchants come thither from India, with ships loaded with
    spicery and precious stones, pearls, cloths of silk and gold, elephants’
    teeth, and many other wares, which they sell to the merchants of Hormos,
    and which these in turn carry all over the world to dispose of again. In
    fact, ’tis a city of immense trade. There are plenty of towns and villages
    under it, but it is the capital. The King is called <span class="smcap">Ruomedam Ahomet</span>. It is
    a very sickly place, and the heat of the sun is tremendous. If any foreign
    merchant dies there, the King takes all his property.</p>

  <p>In this country they make a wine of dates mixt with spices, which is
    very good. When any one not used to it first drinks this wine, it causes
    repeated and violent purging, but afterwards he is all the better for it,
    and gets fat upon it. The people never eat meat and wheaten bread except
    when they are ill, and if they take such food when they are in health it
    makes them ill. Their food when in health consists of dates and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>salt-fish
    (tunny, to wit) and onions, and this kind of diet they maintain in order to
    preserve their health.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIX12" href="#Note_XIX12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>Their ships are wretched affairs, and many of them get lost; for they have
    no iron fastenings, and are only stitched together with twine made from
    the husk of the Indian nut. They beat this husk until it becomes like
    horse-hair, and from that they spin twine, and with this stitch the planks
    of the ships together. It keeps well, and is not corroded by the sea-water,
    but it will not stand well in a storm. The ships are not pitched, but are
    rubbed with fish-oil. They have one mast, one sail, and one rudder, and
    have no deck, but only a cover spread over the cargo when loaded. This
    cover consists of hides, and on the top of these hides they put the horses
    which they take to India for sale. They have no iron to make nails of, and
    for this reason they use only wooden trenails in their shipbuilding, and
    then stitch the planks with twine as I have told you. Hence ’tis a perilous
    business to go a voyage in one of those ships, and many of them are lost,
    for in that Sea of India the storms are often terrible.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIX13" href="#Note_XIX13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>The people are black, and are worshippers of Mahommet. The residents avoid
    living in the cities, for the heat in summer is so great that it would
    kill them. Hence they go out (to sleep) at their gardens in the country,
    where there are streams and plenty of water. For all that they would not
    escape but for one thing that I will mention. The fact is, you see, that
    in summer a wind often blows across the sands which encompass the plain,
    so intolerably hot that it would kill everybody, were it not that when
    they perceive that wind coming they plunge into water up to the neck, and
    so abide until the wind have ceased.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIX14" href="#Note_XIX14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> [And to prove the great heat
    of this wind, Messer Mark related a case that befell when he was there.
    The Lord of Hormos, not having paid his tribute to the King of Kerman the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>latter resolved to claim it at the time when the people of Hormos were
    residing away from the city. So he caused a force of 1600 horse and 5000
    foot to be got ready, and sent them by the route of Reobarles to take
    the others by surprise. Now, it happened one day that through the fault
    of their guide they were not able to reach the place appointed for their
    night’s halt, and were obliged to bivouac in a wilderness not far from
    Hormos. In the morning as they were starting on their march they were
    caught by that wind, and every man of them was suffocated, so that not one
    survived to carry the tidings to their Lord. When the people of Hormos
    heard of this they went forth to bury the bodies lest they should breed a
    pestilence. But when they laid hold of them by the arms to drag them to the
    pits, the bodies proved to be so <em>baked</em>, as it were, by that tremendous
    heat, that the arms parted from the trunks, and in the end the people had
    to dig graves hard by each where it lay, and so cast them in.]<a id="NoteAnchor_XIX15" href="#Note_XIX15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>The people sow their wheat and barley and other corn in the month of
    November, and reap it in the month of March. The dates are not gathered
    till May, but otherwise there is no grass nor any other green thing, for
    the excessive heat dries up everything.</p>

  <p>When any one dies they make a great business of the mourning, for women
    mourn their husbands four years. During that time they mourn at least once
    a day, gathering together their kinsfolk and friends and neighbours for the
    purpose, and making a great weeping and wailing. [And they have women who
    are mourners by trade, and do it for hire.]</p>

  <p>Now, we will quit this country. I shall not, however, now go on to tell you
    about India; but when time and place shall suit we shall come round from
    the north and tell you about it. For the present, let us return by another
    road to the aforesaid city of Kerman, for we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>cannot get at those countries
    that I wish to tell you about except through that city.</p>

  <p>I should tell you first, however, that King Ruomedam Ahomet of Hormos,
    which we are leaving, is a liegeman of the King of Kerman.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIX16" href="#Note_XIX16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <p>On the road by which we return from Hormos to Kerman you meet with some
    very fine plains, and you also find many natural hot baths; you find plenty
    of partridges on the road; and there are towns where victual is cheap and
    abundant, with quantities of dates and other fruits. The wheaten bread,
    however, is so bitter, owing to the bitterness of the water, that no one
    can eat it who is not used to it. The baths that I mentioned have excellent
    virtues; they cure the itch and several other diseases.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIX17" href="#Note_XIX17" class="fnanchor">{7}</a></p>

  <p>Now, then, I am going to tell you about the countries towards the north, of
    which you shall hear in regular order. Let us begin.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XIX11" href="#NoteAnchor_XIX11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Having now arrived at <span class="smcap">Hormuz</span>, it is time to see what can be made of
      the Geography of the route from Kermán to that port.</p>

    <p>The port of Hormuz, [which had taken the place of Kish as the most
      important market of the Persian Gulf (H.&nbsp;C.),] stood upon the mainland. A
      few years later it was transferred to the island which became so famous,
      under circumstances which are concisely related by Abulfeda:—“Hormuz
      is the port of Kermán, a city rich in palms, and very hot. One who has
      visited it in our day tells me that the ancient Hormuz was devastated by
      the incursions of the Tartars, and that its people transferred their abode
      to an island in the sea called Zarun, near the continent, and lying west
      of the old city. At Hormuz itself no inhabitants remain, but some of the
      lowest order.” (In <cite>Büsching</cite>, IV. 261–262.) Friar Odoric, about 1321,
      found Hormuz “on an island some 5 miles distant from the main.” Ibn Batuta,
      some eight or nine years later, discriminates between Hormuz or Moghistan
      on the mainland, and New Hormuz on the Island of Jeraun, but describes only
      the latter, already a great and rich city.</p>

    <p>The site of the Island Hormuz has often been visited and described; but I
      could find no published trace of any traveller having verified the site
      of the more ancient city, though the existence of its ruins was known to
      John de Barros, who says that a little fort called <em>Cuxstac</em> (<em>Kuhestek</em> of
      P. della Valle, II. p. 300) stood on the site. An application to Colonel
      Pelly, the very able British Resident at Bushire, brought me from his
      own personal knowledge the information that I sought, and the following
      particulars are compiled from the letters with which he has favoured me:—</p>

    <p>“The ruins of Old Hormuz, well known as such, stand several miles up
      a creek, and in the centre of the present district of Minao. They are
      extensive (though in large part obliterated by long cultivation over
      the site), and the traces of a long pier or Bandar were pointed out to
      Colonel Pelly. They are about 6 or 7 miles from the fort of Minao, and
      the Minao river, or its stony bed, winds down towards them. The creek is
      quite traceable, but is silted up, and to embark goods you have to go a
      farsakh towards the sea, where there is a custom-house on that part of
      the creek which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>is still navigable. Colonel Pelly collected a few bricks
      from the ruins. From the mouth of the Old Hormuz creek to the New Hormuz
      town, or town of Turumpak on the island of Hormuz, is a sail of about three
      farsakhs. It may be a trifle more, but any native tells you at once that
      it is three farsakhs from Hormuz Island to the creek where you land to go
      up to Minao. <em>Hormuzdia</em> was the name of the region in the days of its
      prosperity. Some people say that Hormuzdia was known as <em>Jerunia</em>, and Old
      Hormuz town as <em>Jerun</em>.” (In this I suspect tradition has gone astray.)
      “The town and fort of Minao lie to the N.E. of the ancient city, and are
      built upon the lowest spur of the Bashkurd mountains, commanding a gorge
      through which the Rudbar river debouches on the plain of Hormuzdia.” In
      these new and interesting particulars it is pleasing to find such precise
      corroboration both of Edrisi and of Ibn Batuta. The former, writing in the
      12th century, says that Hormuz stood on the banks of a canal or creek from
      the Gulf, by which vessels came up to the city. The latter specifies the
      breadth of sea between Old and New Hormuz as <em>three farsakhs</em>. (<cite>Edrisi</cite>,
      I. 424; <i>I. B.</i> II. 230.)</p>

    <p>I now proceed to recapitulate the main features of Polo’s Itinerary from
      Kermán to Hormuz. We have:—</p>

    <p>No European traveller, so far as I know, has described the most direct
      road from Kermán to Hormuz, or rather to its nearest modern representative
      Bander Abbási,—I mean the road by Báft. But a line to the eastward of
      this, and leading through the plain of Jíruft, was followed partially by
      Mr. Abbott in 1850, and completely by Major R. M. Smith, R.E., in 1866.
      The details of this route, except in one particular, correspond closely in
      essentials with those given by our author, and form an excellent basis of
      illustration for Polo’s description.</p>

    <p>Major Smith (accompanied at first by Colonel Goldsmid, who diverged to
      Mekran) left Kermán on the 15th of January, and reached Bander Abbási on
      the 3rd of February, but, as three halts have to be deducted, his total
      number of marches was exactly the same as Marco’s, viz. 17. They divide as
      follows:—</p>

    <p>In the previous edition of this work I was inclined to identify Marco’s
      route <em>absolutely</em> with this Itinerary. But a communication from Major
      St. John, who surveyed the section from Kermán towards Deh Bakri in 1872,
      shows that this first section does not answer well to the description.
      The road is not all plain, for it crosses a mountain pass, though not a
      formidable one. Neither is it through a thriving, populous tract, for, with
      the exception of two large villages, Major St. John found the whole road
      to Deh Bakri from Kermán as desert and dreary as any in Persia. On the
      other hand, the more direct route to the south, which is that always used
      except in seasons of extraordinary severity (such as that of Major Smith’s
      journey, when this route was impassable from snow), answers better, as
      described to Major St. John by muleteers, to Polo’s account. The first <em>six
      days</em> are occupied by a gentle ascent through the districts of Bardesir
      and Kairat-ul-Arab, which are the best-watered and most fertile uplands of
      Kermán. From the crest of the pass reached in those six marches (which is
      probably more than 10,000 feet above the sea, for it was closed by snow
      on 1st May, 1872), an easy descent of <em>two days</em> leads to the Garmsir.
      This is traversed in four days, and then a very difficult pass is crossed
      to reach the plains bordering on the sea. The cold of this route is much
      greater than that of the Deh Bakri route. Hence the correspondence with
      Polo’s description, as far as the descent to the Garmsir, or Reobarles,
      seems decidedly better by this route. It is admitted to be quite possible
      that on reaching this plain the two routes coalesced. We shall assume this
      provisionally, till some traveller gives us a detailed account of the
      Bardesir route. Meantime all the remaining particulars answer well.</p>

    <p>[General Houtum-Schindler (<i>l.c.</i> pp. 493–495), speaking of the Itinerary
      from Kermán to Hormúz and back, says: “Only two of the many routes
      between Kermán and Bender ’Abbás coincide more or less with Marco Polo’s
      description. These two routes are the one over the Deh Bekrí Pass [see
      above, Colonel Smith], and the one <i>viâ</i> Sárdú. The latter is the one, I
      think, taken by Marco Polo. The more direct roads to the west are for the
      greater part through mountainous country, and have not twelve stages in
      plains which we find enumerated in Marco Polo’s Itinerary. The road <i>viâ</i>
      Báft, Urzú, and the Zendán Pass, for instance, has only four stages in
      plains; the road, <i>viâ</i> Ráhbur, Rúdbár and the Nevergún Pass only six; and
      the road <i>viâ</i> Sírján also only six.”</p>

    <p>The Sárdú road enters the Jíruft plain at the ruins of the old city, the
      Deh Bekrí route does so at some distance to the eastward. The first six
      stages performed by Marco Polo in seven days go through fertile plains
      and past numerous villages. Regarding the cold, “which you can scarcely
      abide,” Marco Polo does not speak of it as existing on the mountains only;
      he says, “From the city of Kermán to this descent the cold in winter is
      very great,” that is, from Kermán to near Jíruft. The winter at Kermán
      itself is fairly severe; from the town the ground gradually but steadily
      rises, the absolute altitudes of the passes crossing the mountains to the
      south varying from 8000 to 11,000 feet. These passes are up to the month
      of March always very cold; in one it froze slightly in the beginning of
      June. The Sárdú Pass lies lower than the others. The name is Sárdú, not
      Sardú from sard, “cold.” Major Sykes (<cite>Persia</cite>, ch. xxiii.) comes to the
      same conclusion: “In 1895, and again in 1900, I made a tour partly with the
      object of solving this problem, and of giving a geographical existence to
      Sárdu, which appropriately means the ‘Cold Country.’ I found that there was
      a route which exactly fitted Marco’s conditions, as at Sarbizan the Sárdu
      plateau terminates in a high pass of 9200 feet, from which there is a most
      abrupt descent to the plain of Jíruft, Komádin being about 35 miles, or two
      days’ journey from the top of the pass. Starting from Kermán, the stages
      would be as follows:—I. Jupár (small town); 2. Bahrámjird (large village);
      3. Gudar (village); 4. Ráin (small town).... Thence to the Sarbizan pass is
      a distance of 45 miles, or three desert stages, thus constituting a total
      of 110 miles for the seven days. This is the camel route to the present
      day, and absolutely fits in with the description given.... The question to
      be decided by this section of the journey may then, I think, be considered
      to be finally and most satisfactorily settled, the route proving to lie
      between the two selected by Colonel Yule, as being the most suitable,
      although he wisely left the question open.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>In the abstract of Major Smith’s Itinerary as we have given it, we do not
      find Polo’s city of <em>Camadi</em>. Major Smith writes to me, however, that
      this is probably to be sought in “the ruined city, the traces of which I
      observed in the plain of Jíruft near Kerimabad. The name of the city is
      now apparently lost.” It is, however, known to the natives as the <em>City of
      Dakiánús</em>, as Mr. Abbott, who visited the site, informs us. This is a name
      analogous only to the Arthur’s ovens or Merlin’s caves of our own country,
      for all over Mahomedan Asia there are old sites to which legend attaches
      the name of <em>Dakianus</em> or the Emperor Decius, the persecuting tyrant of the
      Seven Sleepers. “The spot,” says Abbott, “is an elevated part of the plain
      on the right bank of the Hali Rúd, and is thickly strewn with kiln-baked
      bricks, and shreds of pottery and glass.... After heavy rain the peasantry
      search amongst the ruins for ornaments of stone, and rings and coins of
      gold, silver, and copper. The popular tradition concerning the city is that
      it was destroyed by a flood long before the birth of Mahomed.”</p>

    <p>[General Houtum-Schindler, in a paper in the <cite>Jour. R. As. Soc.</cite>, Jan.
      1898, p. 43, gives an abstract of Dr. Houtsma’s (of Utrecht) memoir, <cite>Zur
      Geschichte der Saljuqen von Kerman</cite>, and comes to the conclusion that “from
      these statements we can safely identify Marco Polo’s Camadi with the suburb
      Qumādīn, or, as I would read it, Qamādīn, of the city of Jíruft.”—(Cf.
      <cite>Major Sykes’ Persia</cite>, chap. xxiii.: “Camadi was sacked for the first time,
      after the death of Toghrul Shah of Kermán, when his four sons reduced the
      province to a condition of anarchy.”)</p>

    <p>Major P. Molesworth Sykes, <cite>Recent Journeys in Persia</cite> (<cite>Geog. Journal</cite>,
      X. 1897, p. 589), says: “Upon arrival in Rudbar, we turned northwards
      and left the Farman Farma, in order to explore the site of Marco Polo’s
      ‘Camadi.’... We came upon a huge area littered with yellow bricks eight
      inches square, while not even a broken wall is left to mark the site of
      what was formerly a great city, under the name of the Sher-i-Jiruft.”—H.&nbsp;C.]
      The actual distance from Bamm to the City of Dakianus is, by Abbott’s
      Journal, about 66 miles.</p>

    <p>The name of <span class="smcap">Reobarles</span>, which Marco applies to the plain intermediate
      between <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>the two descents, has given rise to many conjectures. Marsden
      pointed to <cite>Rúdbár</cite>, a name frequently applied in Persia to a district on
      a river, or intersected by streams—a suggestion all the happier that he
      was not aware of the fact that there is a district of <span class="smcap">Rudbar</span> exactly in
      the required position. The last syllable still requires explanation. I
      ventured formerly to suggest that it was the Arabic <em>Laṣṣ</em>, or, as Marco
      would certainly have written it, <em>Les</em>, a robber. Reobarles would then
      be <span class="smcap">Rudbar-i-Laṣṣ</span>, “Robber’s River District.” The appropriateness of the
      name Marco has amply illustrated; and it appeared to me to survive in that
      of one of the rivers of the plain, which is mentioned by both Abbott and
      Smith under the title of <em>Rúdkhánah-i-Duzdi</em>, or Robbery River, a name
      also applied to a village and old fort on the banks of the stream. This
      etymology was, however, condemned as an inadmissible combination of Persian
      and Arabic by two very high authorities both as travellers and scholars—Sir
      H. Rawlinson and Mr. Khanikoff. The <em>Les</em>, therefore, has still to be
      explained.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>[Major Sykes (<cite>Geog. Journal</cite>, 1902, p. 130) heard of robbers, some five
      miles from Mináb, and he adds: “However, nothing happened, and after
      crossing the Gardan-i-Pichal, we camped at Birinti, which is situated just
      above the junction of Rudkhána Duzdi, or ‘River of Theft,’ and forms part
      of the district of Rudán, in Fars.”</p>

    <p>“The Jíruft and Rúdbár plains belong to the germsír (hot region), dates,
      pistachios, and konars (apples of Paradise) abound in them. Reobarles is
      Rúdbár or Rüdbáris.” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> 1881, p. 495.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>We have referred to Marco’s expressions regarding the great cold
      experienced on the pass which formed the first descent; and it is worthy of
      note that the title of “The Cold Mountains” is applied by Edrisi to these
      very mountains. Mr. Abbott’s MS. Report also mentions in this direction,
      <em>Sardu</em>, said to be a cold country (as its name seems to express [see
      above,—H.&nbsp;C.]), which its population (Iliyáts) abandon in winter for the
      lower plains. It is but recently that the importance of this range of
      mountains has become known to us. Indeed the <em>existence</em> of the chain, as
      extending continuously from near Kashán, was first indicated by Khanikoff
      in 1862. More recently Major St. John has shown the magnitude of this
      range, which rises into summits of 15,000 feet in altitude, and after a
      course of 550 miles terminates in a group of volcanic hills some 50 miles
      S.E. of Bamm. Yet practically this chain is ignored on all our maps!</p>

    <p>Marco’s description of the “Plain of Formosa” does not apply, now at least,
      to the <em>whole</em> plain, for towards Bander Abbási it is barren. But to the
      eastward, about Minao, and therefore about Old Hormuz, it has not fallen
      off. Colonel Pelly writes: “The district of Minao is still for those
      regions singularly fertile. Pomegranates, oranges, pistachio-nuts, and
      various other fruits grow in profusion. The source of its fertility is of
      course the river, and you can walk for miles among lanes and cultivated
      ground, partially sheltered from the sun.” And Lieutenant Kempthorne, in
      his notes on that coast, says of the same tract: “It is termed by the
      natives the Paradise of Persia. It is certainly most beautifully fertile,
      and abounds in orange-groves, and orchards containing apples, pears,
      peaches, and apricots; with vineyards producing a delicious grape, from
      which was at one time made a wine called <em>amber-rosolli</em>”—a name not easy
      to explain. <em>’Ambar-i-Rasúl</em>, “The Prophet’s Bouquet!” would be too bold a
      name even for Persia, though names more sacred are so profaned at Naples
      and on the Moselle. Sir H. Rawlinson suggests <em>’Ambar-’asali</em>, “Honey
      Bouquet,” as possible.</p>

    <p>When Nearchus beached his fleet on the shore of <em>Harmozeia</em> at the mouth
      of the <em>Anamis</em> (the River of Minao), Arrian tells us he found the country
      a kindly one, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>very fruitful in every way except that there were no
      olives. The weary mariners landed and enjoyed this pleasant rest from their
      toils. (<cite>Indica</cite>, 33; <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> V. 274.)</p>

    <p>The name Formosa is probably only Rusticiano’s misunderstanding of
      <em>Harmuza</em>, aided, perhaps, by Polo’s picture of the beauty of the plain.
      We have the same change in the old <em>Mafomet</em> for Mahomet, and the converse
      one in the Spanish <i lang="es">hermosa</i> for <em>formosa</em>. Teixeira’s Chronicle says that
      the city of Hormuz was founded by Xa Mahamed Dranku, <i>i.e.</i> Shah Mahomed
      Dirhem-Ko, in “a plain of the same name.”</p>

    <p>The statement in Ramusio that Hormuz stood upon an island, is, I doubt not,
      an interpolation by himself or some earlier transcriber.</p>

    <p>When the ships of Nearchus launched again from the mouth of the Anamis,
      their first day’s run carried them past a certain desert and bushy island
      to another which was large and inhabited. The desert isle was called
      <em>Organa</em>; the large one by which they anchored <em>Oaracta</em>. (<cite>Indica</cite>, 37.)
      Neither name is quite lost; the latter greater island is Kishm or <em>Brakht</em>;
      the former <em>Jerún</em>,<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> perhaps in old Persian <em>Gerún</em> or <em>Gerán</em>, now
      again desert though no longer bushy, after having been for three centuries
      the site of a city which became a poetic type of wealth and splendour. An
      Eastern saying ran, “Were the world a ring, Hormuz would be the jewel in it.”</p>

    <p>[“The <cite>Yüan shi</cite> mentions several seaports of the Indian Ocean as carrying
      on trade with China; Hormuz is not spoken of there. I may, however, quote
      from the Yüan History a curious statement which perhaps refers to this
      port. In ch. cxxiii., biography of Arsz-lan, it is recorded that his
      grandson Hurdutai, by order of Kubilai Khan, accompanied <em>Bu-lo no-yen</em>
      on his mission to the country of <em>Ha-rh-ma-sz</em>. This latter name may be
      intended for Hormuz. I do not think that by the Noyen <em>Bulo</em>, M. Polo could
      be meant, for the title Noyen would hardly have been applied to him. But
      Rashid-eddin mentions a distinguished Mongol, by name <em>Pulad</em>, with whom
      he was acquainted in Persia, and who furnished him with much information
      regarding the history of the Mongols. This may be the <em>Bu-lo no-yen</em> of the
      Yüan History.” (Bretschneider, <cite>Med. Res.</cite> II. p. 132.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIX12" href="#NoteAnchor_XIX12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—A spirit is still distilled from dates in Persia, Mekran, Sind,
      and some places in the west of India. It is mentioned by Strabo and

    <p>The date and dry-fish diet of the Gulf people is noticed by most
      travellers, and P. della Valle repeats the opinion about its being the only
      wholesome one. Ibn Batuta says the people of Hormuz had a saying, “<em>Khormá
      wa máhí lút-i-Pádshahi</em>,” <i>i.e.</i> “Dates and fish make an Emperor’s dish!” A
      fish, exactly like the tunny of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>Mediterranean in general appearance
      and habits, is one of the great objects of fishery off the Sind and Mekran
      coasts. It comes in pursuit of shoals of anchovies, very much like the
      Mediterranean fish also. (<cite>I. B.</cite> II. 231; <cite>Sir B. Frere</cite>.)</p>

    <p>[Friar Odoric (<cite>Cathay</cite>, I. pp. 55–56) says: “And there you find (before
      arriving at Hormuz) people who live almost entirely on dates, and you get
      forty-two pounds of dates for less than a groat; and so of many other things.”]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIX13" href="#NoteAnchor_XIX13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The
      stitched vessels of Kermán (<span lang="el">πλοιάρια ῥαπτὰ</span>) are
      noticed in the <cite>Periplus</cite>. Similar accounts to those of our text are given
      of the ships of the Gulf and of Western India by Jordanus and John of
      Montecorvino. (<cite>Jord.</cite> p. 53; <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 217.) “Stitched vessels,” Sir
      B. Frere writes, “are still used. I have seen them of 200 tons burden; but
      they are being driven out by iron-fastened vessels, as iron gets cheaper,
      except where (as on the Malabar and Coromandel coasts) the pliancy of a
      stitched boat is useful in a surf. Till the last few years, when steamers
      have begun to take all the best horses, the Arab horses bound to Bombay
      almost all came in the way Marco Polo describes.” Some of them do still,
      standing over a date cargo, and the result of this combination gives
      rise to an extraordinary traffic in the Bombay bazaar. From what Colonel
      Pelly tells me, the stitched build in the Gulf is <em>now</em> confined to
      fishing-boats, and is disused for sea-going craft.</p>

    <p>[Friar Odoric (<cite>Cathay</cite>, I. p. 57) mentioned these vessels: “In this
      country men make use of a kind of vessel which they call <em>Jase</em>, which is
      fastened only with stitching of twine. On one of these vessels I embarked,
      and I could find no iron at all therein.” <em>Jase</em> is for the Arabic
      <em>Djehaz</em>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The fish-oil used to rub the ships was whale-oil. The old Arab voyagers of
      the 9th century describe the fishermen of Siraf in the Gulf as cutting up
      the whale-blubber and drawing the oil from it, which was mixed with other
      stuff, and used to rub the joints of ships’ planking. (<cite>Reinaud</cite>, I. 146.)</p>

    <p>Both Montecorvino and Polo, in this passage, specify <em>one rudder</em>, as if
      it was a peculiarity of these ships worth noting. The fact is that, in
      the Mediterranean at least, the double rudders of the ancients kept their
      place to a great extent through the Middle Ages. A Marseilles MS. of the
      13th century, quoted in Ducange, says: “A ship requires three rudders,
      two in place, and one to spare.” Another: “Every two-ruddered bark shall
      pay a groat each voyage; every one-ruddered bark shall,” etc. (See Duc.
      under <em>Timonus</em> and <em>Temo</em>.) Numerous proofs of the use of two rudders in
      the 13th century will be found in “<cite>Documenti inediti riguardanti le due
      Crociate di S. Ludovico IX., Re di Francia</cite>, etc., da <cite>L. T. Belgrano</cite>,
      Genova, 1859.” Thus in a specification of ships to be built at Genoa for
      the king (p. 7), each is to have “<em>Timones duo</em>, affaiticos, grossitudinis
      palmorum viiii et dimidiae, longitudinis cubitorum xxiiii.” Extracts given
      by Capmany, regarding the equipment of galleys, show the same thing, for
      he is probably mistaken in saying that one of the <em>dos timones</em> specified
      was a spare one. Joinville (p. 205) gives incidental evidence of the
      same: “Those Marseilles ships have each two rudders, with each a tiller
      (? <em>tison</em>) attached to it in such an ingenious way that you can turn the
      ship right or left as fast as you would turn a horse. So on the Friday the
      king was sitting upon one of these tillers, when he called me and said to
      me,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Francesco da Barberino, a poet of the 13th century, in the 7th
      part of his <cite>Documenti d’Amore</cite> (printed at Rome in 1640), which instructs
      the lover to whose lot it may fall to escort his lady on a sea-voyage
      (instructions carried so far as to provide even for the case of her death
      at sea!), alludes more than once to these plural rudders. Thus—</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

    <p>A representation of a vessel over the door of the Leaning Tower at Pisa
      shows this arrangement, which is also discernible in the frescoes of
      galley-fights by Spinello Aretini, in the Municipal Palace at Siena.</p>

    <p>[Godinho de Eredia (1613), describing the smaller vessels of Malacca which
      he calls <em>bâlos</em> in ch. 13, <cite>De Embarcaçôes</cite>, says: “At the poop they have
      two rudders, one on each side to steer with.” E por poupa dos bâllos, tem
      2 lêmes, hum en cada lado pera o governo. (<cite>Malacca, l’ Inde mérid. et le
      Cathay</cite>, Bruxelles, 1882, 4to, f. 26.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The midship rudder seems to have been the more usual in the western seas,
      and the double quarter-rudders in the Mediterranean. The former are
      sometimes styled <em>Navarresques</em> and the latter <em>Latins</em>. Yet early seals of
      some of the Cinque Ports show vessels with the double rudder; one of which
      (that of Winchelsea) is given in the cut.</p>

    <p>In the Mediterranean the latter was still in occasional use late in the
      16th century. Captain Pantero Pantera in his book, <cite>L’ Armata Navale</cite> (Rome,
      1614, p. 44), says that the Galeasses, or great galleys, had the helm
      <em>alla Navarresca</em>, but also a great oar on each side of it to assist in
      turning the ship. And I observe that the great galeasses which precede the
      Christian line of battle at Lepanto, in one of the frescoes by Vasari in
      the Royal Hall leading to the Sistine Chapel, have the quarter-rudder very
      distinctly.</p>

    <p>The Chinese appear occasionally to employ it, as seems to be indicated in
      a woodcut of a vessel of war which I have traced from a Chinese book in
      the National Library at Paris. (See above, <a href="#Page_37">p. 37</a>.) [For the Chinese words
      for <em>rudder</em>, see p. 126 of J. Edkins’ article on <cite>Chinese Names for Boats
      and Boat Gear, Jour. N. China Br. R. As. Soc.</cite> N.S. XI. 1876.—H.&nbsp;C.] It
      is also used by certain craft of the Indian Archipelago, as appears from
      Mr. Wallace’s description of the Prau in which he sailed from Macassar to
      the Aru Islands. And on the Caspian, it is stated in Smith’s “Dict. of
      Antiquities” (art. <cite>Gubernaculum</cite>), the practice remained in force till
      late times. A modern traveller was nearly wrecked on that sea, because the
      two rudders were in the hands of two pilots who spoke different languages,
      and did not understand each other!</p>

    <p>(Besides the works quoted see <cite>Jal, Archéologie Navale</cite>, II. 437–438, and
      <cite>Capmany, Memorias</cite>, III. 61.)</p>

    <p>[Major Sykes remarks (<cite>Persia</cite>, ch. xxiii.): “Some unrecorded event,
      probably the sight of the unseaworthy craft, which had not an ounce of iron
      in their composition, made our travellers decide that the risks of the sea
      were too great, so that we have the pleasure of accompanying them back to
      Kermán and thence northwards to Khorasán.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIX14" href="#NoteAnchor_XIX14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—So also at Bander Abbási Tavernier says it was so unhealthy that
      foreigners could not stop there beyond March; everybody left it in April.
      Not a hundredth part of the population, says Kämpfer, remained in the city.
      Not a beggar would stop for any reward! The rich went to the towns of the
      interior or to the cool recesses of the mountains, the poor took refuge
      in the palm-groves at the distance of a day or two from the city. A place
      called ’Ishin, some 12 miles north of the city, was a favourite resort of
      the European and Hindu merchants. Here were fine gardens, spacious baths,
      and a rivulet of fresh and limpid water.</p>

    <p>The custom of lying in water is mentioned also by Sir John Maundevile, and
      it was adopted by the Portuguese when they occupied Insular Hormuz, as P.
      della Valle and Linschoten relate. The custom is still common during great
      heats, in Sind and Mekran (Sir B. F.).</p>

    <p>An anonymous ancient geography (<cite>Liber Junioris Philosophi</cite>) speaks of a
      people <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>in India who live in the Terrestrial Paradise, and lead the life
      of the Golden Age.... The sun is so hot <em>that they remain all day in the river!</em></p>

    <p>The heat in the Straits of Hormuz drove Abdurrazzak into an anticipation of
      a verse familiar to English schoolboys: “Even the bird of rapid flight was
      burnt up in the heights of heaven, as well as the fish in the depths of the
      sea!” (<cite>Tavern.</cite> Bk. V. ch. xxiii.; <cite>Am. Exot.</cite> 716, 762; <cite>Müller, Geog.
      Gr. Min.</cite> II. 514; <cite>India in XV. Cent.</cite> p. 49.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIX15" href="#NoteAnchor_XIX15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—A like description of the effect of the <em>Simúm</em> on the human body
      is given by Ibn Batuta, Chardin, A. Hamilton, Tavernier, Thévenot, etc.;
      and the first of these travellers speaks specially of its prevalence in the
      desert near Hormuz, and of the many graves of its victims; but I have met
      with no reasonable account of its poisonous action. I will quote Chardin,
      already quoted at greater length by Marsden, as the most complete parallel
      to the text: “The most surprising effect of the wind is not the mere fact
      of its causing death, but its operation on the bodies of those who are
      killed by it. It seems as if they became decomposed without losing shape,
      so that you would think them to be merely asleep, when they are not merely
      dead, but in such a state that if you take hold of any part of the body it
      comes away in your hand. And the finger penetrates such a body as if it
      were so much dust.” (III. 286.)</p>

    <p>Burton, on his journey to Medina, says: “The people assured me that this
      wind never killed a man in their Allah-favoured land. I doubt the fact.
      At Bir Abbas the body of an Arnaut was brought in swollen, and decomposed
      rapidly, the true diagnosis of death by the poison-wind.” Khanikoff is
      very distinct as to the immediate fatality of the desert wind at Khabis,
      near Kermán, but does not speak of the effect on the body after death.
      This Major St. John does, describing a case that occurred in June, 1871,
      when he was halting, during intense heat, at the post-house of Pasangan,
      a few miles south of Kom. The bodies were brought in of two poor men,
      who had tried to start some hours before sunset, and were struck down by
      the poisonous blast within half-a-mile of the post-house. “It was found
      impossible to wash them before burial.... Directly the limbs were touched
      they separated from the trunk.” (<cite>Oc. Highways, ut. sup.</cite>) About 1790, when
      Timúr Sháh of Kabul sent an army under the Sirdár-i-Sirdárán to put down
      a revolt in Meshed, this force on its return was struck by Simúm in the
      Plain of Farrah, and the Sirdár perished, with a great number of his men.
      (<cite>Ferrier, H. of the Afghans</cite>, 102; <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXVI. 217; <cite>Khan. Mém.</cite> 210.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIX16" href="#NoteAnchor_XIX16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—The History of Hormuz is very imperfectly known. What I have met
      with on the subject consists of—(1) An abstract by Teixeira of a chronicle
      of Hormuz, written by Thurán Sháh, who was himself sovereign of Hormuz,
      and died in 1377; (2) some contemporary notices by Wassáf, which are
      extracted by Hammer in his History of the Ilkhans; (3) some notices from
      Persian sources in the 2nd Decade of De Barros (ch. ii.). The last do not
      go further back than Gordun Sháh, the father of Thurán Sháh, to whom they
      erroneously ascribe the first migration to the Island.</p>

    <p>One of Teixeira’s Princes is called <em>Ruknuddin Mahmud</em>, and with him
      Marsden and Pauthier have identified Polo’s Ruomedam Acomet, or as he is
      called on another occasion in the Geog. Text, <em>Maimodi Acomet</em>. This,
      however, is out of the question, for the death of Ruknuddin is assigned
      to <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span> 675 (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1277), whilst there can, I think, be no doubt that
      Marco’s account refers to the period of his return from China, viz. 1293 or
      thereabouts.</p>

    <p>We find in Teixeira that the ruler who succeeded in 1290 was <em>Amir
      Masa’úd</em>, who obtained the Government by the murder of his brother
      Saifuddin Nazrat. Masa’úd was cruel and oppressive; most of the influential
      people withdrew to Baháuddin Ayaz, whom Saifuddin had made Wazir of Kalhát
      on the Arabian coast. This Wazir assembled a force and drove out Masa’úd
      after he had reigned three years. He fled to Kermán and died there some
      years afterwards.</p>

    <p>Baháuddin, who had originally been a slave of Saifuddin Nazrat’s, succeeded
      in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>establishing his authority. But about 1300 great bodies of Turks
      (<i>i.e.</i> Tartars) issuing from Turkestan ravaged many provinces of Persia,
      including Kermán and Hormuz. The people, unable to bear the frequency
      of such visitations, retired first to the island of Kishm, and then to
      that of Jerún, on which last was built the city of New Hormuz, afterwards
      so famous. This is Teixeira’s account from Thurán Sháh, so far as we
      are concerned with it. As regards the transfer of the city it agrees
      substantially with Abulfeda’s, which we have already quoted (<i>supra</i>, note 1).</p>

    <p>Hammer’s account from Wassáf is frightfully confused, chiefly I should
      suppose from Hammer’s own fault; for among other things he assumes that
      Hormuz was always on an island, and he distinguishes between the Island
      of Hormuz and the Island of Jerún! We gather, however, that Hormuz before
      the Mongol time formed a government subordinate to the Salghur Atabegs of
      Fars (see <a href="#Note_XV11">note 1, ch. xv.</a>), and when the power of that Dynasty was falling,
      the governor Mahmúd Kalháti, established himself as Prince of Hormuz, and
      became the founder of a petty dynasty, being evidently identical with
      Teixeira’s Ruknuddin Mahmud above-named, who is represented as reigning
      from 1246 to 1277. In Wassáf we find, as in Teixeira, Mahmúd’s son Masa’úd
      killing his brother Nazrat, and Baháuddin expelling Masa’úd. It is true
      that Hammer’s surprising muddle makes Nazrat kill Masa’úd; however, as
      a few lines lower we find Masa’úd alive and Nazrat dead, we may safely
      venture on this correction. But we find also that Masa’úd appears as
      <em>Ruknuddin</em> Masa’úd, and that Baháuddin does not assume the princely
      authority himself, but proclaims that of <em>Fakhruddin Ahmed</em> Ben Ibrahim
      At-Thaibi, a personage who does not appear in Teixeira at all. A MS.
      history, quoted by Ouseley, <em>does</em> mention Fakhruddin, and ascribes to him
      the transfer to Jerún. Wassáf seems to allude to Baháuddin as a sort of Sea
      Rover, occupying the islands of Larek and Jerún, whilst Fakhruddin reigned
      at Hormuz. It is difficult to understand the relation between the two.</p>

    <p>It is <em>possible</em> that Polo’s memory made some confusion between the names
      of <span class="smcap">Ruknuddin</span> Masa’úd and Fakhruddin <span class="smcap">Ahmed</span>, but I incline to think the
      latter is his <span class="smcap">Ruomedan Ahmed</span>. For Teixeira tells us that Masa’úd took
      refuge at the court of Kermán, and Wassáf represents him as supported in
      his claims by the Atabeg of that province, whilst we see that Polo seems to
      represent Ruomedan Acomat as in hostility with that prince. To add to the
      imbroglio I find in a passage of Wassáf Malik Fakhruddin Ahmed at-Thaibi
      sent by Ghazan Khan in 1297 as ambassador to Khanbalig, staying there some
      years, and dying off the Coromandel coast on his return in 1305. (Elliot,
      iii. pp. 45–47.)</p>

    <p>Masa’úd’s seeking help from Kermán to reinstate him is not the first case
      of the same kind that occurs in Teixeira’s chronicle, so there may have
      been some kind of colour for Marco’s representation of the Prince of Hormuz
      as the vassal of the Atabeg of Kermán (“<i lang="fr">l’homme de cest roy de Creman;</i>”
      see <cite>Prologue</cite>, <a href="#Note_XIVp2">ch. xiv. note 2</a>). M. Khanikoff denies the <em>possibility</em>
      of the existence of any <em>royal dynasty</em> at Hormuz at this period. That
      there <em>was</em> a dynasty of <em>Maliks</em> of Hormuz, however, at this period we
      must believe on the concurring testimony of Marco, of Wassáf, and of
      Thurán Sháh. There was also, it would seem, another <em>quasi</em>-independent
      principality in the Island of Kais. (<cite>Hammer’s Ilch.</cite> II. 50, 51;
      <cite>Teixeira, Relacion de los Reyes de Hormuz; Khan. Notice</cite>, p. 34.)</p>

    <p>The ravages of the Tartars which drove the people of Hormuz from their city
      may have begun with the incursions of the Nigudaris and Karaunahs, but they
      probably came to a climax in the great raid in 1299 of the Chaghataian
      Prince Kotlogh Shah, son of Dua Khan, a part of whose bands besieged the
      city itself, though they are said to have been repulsed by Baháuddin Ayas.</p>

    <p>[The Dynasty of Hormuz was founded about 1060 by a Yemen chief Mohammed
      Dirhem Ko, and remained subject to Kermán till 1249, when Rokn ed-din
      Mahmúd III. Kalháti (1242–1277) made himself independent. The immediate
      successors of Rokn ed-din were Saif ed-din Nazrat (1277–1290), Masa’úd
      (1290–1293), Bahad ed-din Ayaz Sayfin (1293–1311). Hormuz was captured by
      the Portuguese in 1510 and by the Persians in 1622.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIX17" href="#NoteAnchor_XIX17" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.</a>—The indications of this alternative route to Kermán are very vague,
      but it may probably have been that through Finn, Tárum, and the Sírján
      district, passing out of the plain of Hormuz by the eastern flank of the
      Ginao mountain. This road would pass near the hot springs at the base
      of the said mountain, Sarga, Khurkhu, and Ginao, which are described by
      Kämpfer. Being more or less sulphureous they are likely to be useful in
      skin-diseases: indeed, Hamilton speaks of their efficacy in these. (I. 95.)
      The salt-streams are numerous on this line, and dates are abundant. The
      bitterness of the bread was, however, more probably due to another cause,
      as Major Smith has kindly pointed out to me: “Throughout the mountains in
      the south of Persia, which are generally covered with dwarf oak, the people
      are in the habit of making bread of the acorns, or of the acorns mixed
      with wheat or barley. It is dark in colour, and very hard, bitter, and
      unpalatable.”</p>

    <p>Major St. John also noticed the bitterness of the bread in Kermán, but his
      servants attributed it to the presence in the wheat-fields of a bitter
      leguminous plant, with a yellowish white flower, which the Kermánis were
      too lazy to separate, so that much remained in the thrashing, and imparted
      its bitter flavour to the grain (surely the <em>Tare</em> of our Lord’s Parable!).</p>

    <p>[General Houtum-Schindler says (<i>l.c.</i> p. 496): “Marco Polo’s return
      journey was, I am inclined to think, <i>viâ</i> Urzú and Báft, the shortest and
      most direct road. The road <i>viâ</i> Tárum and Sírján is very seldom taken by
      travellers intending to go to Kermán; it is only frequented by the caravans
      going between Bender ’Abbás and Bahrámábád, three stages west of Kermán.
      Hot springs, ‘curing itch,’ I noticed at two places on the Urzú-Báft
      road. There were some near Qal’ah Asgher and others near Dashtáb; they
      were frequented by people suffering from skin-diseases, and were highly
      sulphureous; the water of those near Dashtáb turned a silver ring black
      after two hours’ immersion. Another reason of my advocating the Urzú road
      is that the bitter bread spoken of by Marco Polo is only found on it,
      viz. at Báft and in Bardshír. In Sírján, to the west, and on the roads to
      the east, the bread is sweet. The bitter taste is from the Khúr, a bitter
      leguminous plant, which grows among the wheat, and whose grains the people
      are too lazy to pick out. There is not a single oak between Bender ’Abbás
      and Kermán; none of the inhabitants seemed to know what an acorn was. A
      person at Báft, who had once gone to Kerbelá <i>viâ</i> Kermánsháh and Baghdád,
      recognised my sketch of tree and fruit immediately, having seen oak and
      acorn between Kermánsháh and Qasr-i-Shírín on the Baghdád road.” Major
      Sykes writes (ch. xxiii.): “The above description undoubtedly refers to
      the main winter route, which runs <i>viâ</i> Sírján. This is demonstrated by the
      fact that under the Kuh-i-Ginao, the summer station of Bandar Abbás, there
      is a magnificent sulphur spring, which, welling from an orifice 4 feet in
      diameter, forms a stream some 30 yards wide. Its temperature at the source
      is 113 degrees, and its therapeutic properties are highly appreciated. As
      to the bitterness of the bread, it is suggested in the notes that it was
      caused by being mixed with acorns, but, to-day at any rate, there are no
      oak forests in this part of Persia, and I would urge that it is better to
      accept our traveller’s statement, that it was due to the bitterness of the
      water.”—However, I prefer Gen. Houtum-Schindler’s theory.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      Sprenger and Blochmann have considered the original suggestion
      lawful and probable. Indeed, Mr. Blochmann says in a letter: “After
      studying a language for years, one acquires a natural feeling for
      anything un-idiomatic; but I must confess I see nothing un-Persian
      in <em>rúdbár-i-duzd</em>, nor in <em>rúdbár-i-lass</em>.... How common <em>lass</em>
      is, you may see from one fact, that it occurs in children’s
      reading-books.” We must not take <em>Reobarles</em> in Marco’s French
      as rhyming to (French) <em>Charles</em>; every syllable sounds. It is
      remarkable that <em>Lăs</em>, as the name of a small State near our Sind
      frontier, is said to mean, “in the language of the country,” <em>a
      level plain</em>. (<cite>J. A. S. B.</cite> VIII. 195.) It is not clear what is
      meant by the language of the country. The chief is a Brahui, the
      people are Lumri or Numri Bilúchis, who are, according to Tod, of
      Jat descent.</div>

      probably “Angan, formerly Argan.” To this I cannot assent. Nearchus
      sails 300 stadia from the mouth of Anamis to Oaracta, and <em>on his
      way</em> passes Organa. Taking 600 stadia to the degree (Dr. Müller’s
      value), I make it just 300 stadia from the mouth of the Hormuz creek
      to the eastern point of Kishm. Organa must have been either Jerún or
      Lárek; Angan (<em>Hanjám</em> of Mas’udi) is out of the question. And as a
      straight run must have passed quite close to Jerún, not to Lárek, I
      find the former most probable. Nearchus next day proceeds 200 stadia
      along Oaracta, and anchors in sight of another island (Neptune’s)
      which was separated by 40 stadia from Oaracta. <em>This</em> was Angan;

  <div class="subh4">Of the Wearisome and Desert Road that has now to be travelled.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> departing from the city of Kerman you find the road for seven days most
    wearisome; and I will tell you how this is.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX11" href="#Note_XX11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> The first three days
    you meet with no water, or next to none. And what little you do meet with
    is bitter green stuff, so salt that no one can drink it; and in fact if you
    drink a drop of it, it will set you purging ten times at least by the way.
    It is the same with the salt which is made from those streams; no one dares
    to make use of it, because of the excessive purging which it occasions.
    Hence it is necessary to carry water for the people to last these three
    days; as for the cattle, they must needs drink of the bad water I have
    mentioned, as there is no help for it, and their great thirst makes them do
    so. But it scours them to such a degree that sometimes they die of it. In
    all those three days you meet with no human habitation; it is all desert,
    and the extremity of drought. Even of wild beasts there are none, for there
    is nothing for them to eat.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX12" href="#Note_XX12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>After those three days of desert [you arrive at a stream of fresh water
    running underground, but along which there are holes broken in here and
    there, perhaps undermined by the stream, at which you can get sight of it.
    It has an abundant supply, and travellers, worn with the hardships of the
    desert, here rest and refresh themselves and their beasts.]<a id="NoteAnchor_XX13" href="#Note_XX13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>You then enter another desert which extends for four days; it is very
    much like the former except that you do see some wild asses. And at the
    termination of these four days of desert the kingdom of Kerman comes to an
    end, and you find another city which is called Cobinan.</p>

      miles, to the Sár i Benán 15 miles, thence to Kúbenán 30 miles—total 95
      miles. Marco Polo cannot have taken the direct road to Kúbenán, as it took
      him seven days to reach it. As he speaks of waterless deserts, he probably
      took a circuitous route to the east of the mountains, <i>viâ</i> Kúhpáyeh and
      the desert lying to the north of Khabis.” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> pp.
      496–497.) (Cf. <cite>Major Sykes</cite>, ch. xxiii.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX12" href="#NoteAnchor_XX12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—This description of the Desert of Kermán, says Mr. Khanikoff,
      “is very correct. As the only place in the Desert of Lút where water is
      found is the dirty, salt, bitter, and green water of the rivulet called
      <em>Shor-Rúd</em> (the Salt River), we can have no doubt of the direction of
      Marco Polo’s route from Kermán so far.” Nevertheless I do not agree with
      Khanikoff that the route lay N.E. in the direction of Ambar and Kain, for
      a reason which will appear under the next chapter. I imagine the route to
      have been nearly due north from Kermán, in the direction of Tabbas or of
      Tún. And even such a route would, according to Khanikoff’s own map, pass
      the Shor-Rúd, though at a higher point.</p>

    <p>I extract a few lines from that gentleman’s narrative: “In proportion as we
      got deeper into the desert, the soil became more and more arid; at daybreak
      I could still discover a few withered plants of <em>Caligonum</em> and <em>Salsola</em>,
      and not far from the same spot I saw a lark and another bird of a whitish
      colour, the last living things that we beheld in this dismal solitude....
      The desert had now completely assumed the character of a land accursed,
      as the natives call it. Not the smallest blade of grass, no indication of
      animal life vivified the prospect; no sound but such as came from our own
      caravan broke the dreary silence of the void.” (<cite>Mém.</cite> p. 176.)</p>

    <p>[Major P. Molesworth Sykes (<cite>Geog. Jour.</cite> X. p. 578) writes: “At Tun, I
      was on the northern edge of the great Dash-i-Lut (Naked Desert), which lay
      between us and Kerman, and which had not been traversed, in this particular
      portion, since the illustrious Marco Polo crossed it, in the opposite
      direction, when travelling from Kerman to ‘Tonocain’ <i>viâ</i> Cobinan.” Major
      Sykes (<cite>Persia</cite>, ch. iii.) seems to prove that geographers have, without
      sufficient grounds, divided the great desert of Persia into two regions,
      that to the north being termed Dasht-i-Kavir, and that further south the
      Dasht-i-Lut—and that Lut is the one name for the whole desert, Dash-i-Lut
      being almost a redundancy, and that <em>Kavir</em> (the Arabic <em>Kafr</em>) is applied
      to every saline swamp. “This great desert stretches from a few miles out
      of Tehrán practically to the British frontier, a distance of about 700
      miles.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX13" href="#NoteAnchor_XX13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—I can have no doubt of the genuineness of this passage from
      Ramusio. Indeed some such passage is necessary; otherwise why distinguish
      between three days of desert and four days more of desert? The underground
      stream was probably a subterraneous canal (called <em>Kanát</em> or <em>Kárez</em>),
      such as is common in Persia; often conducted from a great distance. Here
      it may have been a relic of abandoned cultivation. Khanikoff, on the
      road between Kermán and Yezd, not far west of that which I suppose Marco
      to be travelling, says: “At the fifteen inhabited spots marked upon the
      map, they have water which has been brought from a great distance, and at
      considerable cost, by means of subterranean galleries, to which you descend
      by large and deep wells. Although the water flows at some depth, its course
      is tracked upon the surface by a line of more abundant vegetation.” (<i>Ib.</i>
      p. 200.) Elphinstone says he has heard of such subterranean conduits 36
      miles in length. (I. 398.) Polybius speaks of them: “There is no sign of
      water on the surface; but there are many underground channels, and these
      supply tanks in the desert, that are known only to the initiated.... At the
      time when the Persians got the upper hand in Asia, they used to concede
      to such persons as brought spring-water to places previously destitute of
      irrigation, the usufruct for five generations. And Taurus being rife with
      springs, they incurred all the expense and trouble that was needed to form
      these underground channels to great distances, insomuch that in these days
      even the people who make use of the water don’t know where the channels
      begin, or whence the water comes.” (X. 28.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXI11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—<span class="smcap">Kuh-Banán</span> is mentioned by Moḳaddasi (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 985) as one of the cities
      of Bardesír, the most northerly of the five circles into which he divides
      Kermán. (See <cite>Sprenger, Post-und Reise-routen des Orients</cite>, p. 77.) It
      is the subject of an article in the Geog. Dictionary of Yáḳút, though it
      has been there mistranscribed into <em>Kubiyán</em> and <em>Kukiyán</em>. (See Leipzig
      ed. 1869, iv. p. 316, and <cite>Barbier de Meynard</cite>, <cite>Dict. de la Perse</cite>, p.
      498.) And it is also indicated by Mr. Abbott (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXV. 25) as
      the name of a district of Kermán, lying some distance to the east of his
      route when somewhat less than half-way between Yezd and Kermán. It would
      thus, I apprehend, be on or near the route between Kermán and Tabbas; one
      which I believe has been traced by no modern traveller. We may be certain
      that there is now no place at Kuh-Banán deserving the title of <i lang="fr">une cité
      grant</i>, nor is it easy to believe that there was in Polo’s time; he applies
      such terms too profusely. The meaning of the name is perhaps “Hill of the
      Terebinths, or Wild Pistachioes,” “a tree which grows abundantly in the
      recesses of bleak, stony, and desert mountains, <i>e.g.</i> about Shamákhi, about
      Shiraz, and in the deserts of Luristan and Lar.” (<cite>Kämpfer</cite>, 409, 413.)</p>

    <p>[“It is strange that Marco Polo speaks of Kúbenán only on his return
      journey from Kermán; on the down journey he must have been told that
      Kúbenán was in close proximity; it is even probable that he passed there,
      as Persian travellers of those times, when going from Kermán to Yazd, and
      <i>vice versá</i>, always called at Kúbenán.” (<cite>Houtum-Schindler</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p.
      490.) In all histories this name is written Kúbenán, not Kúhbenán; the
      pronunciation to-day is Kóbenán and Kobenún.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>I had thought my identification of <em>Cobinan</em> original, but a communication
      from Mr. Abbott, and the opportunity which this procured me of seeing his
      MS. Report already referred to, showed that he had anticipated me many
      years ago. The following is an extract: “<em>Districts of Kerman * * * Kooh
      Benan</em>. This is a hilly district abounding in fruits, such as grapes,
      peaches, pomegranates, <em>sinjid</em> (sweet-willow), walnuts, melons. A great
      deal of madder and some asafœtida is produced there. <em>This is no doubt the
      country alluded to by Marco Polo, under the name of Cobinam</em>, as producing
      iron, brass, and tutty, and which is still said to produce iron, copper,
      and tootea.” There appear to be lead mines also in the district, as well as
      asbestos and sulphur. Mr. Abbott adds the names of nine villages, which he
      was not able to verify by comparison. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>These are Púz, Tarz, Gújard, Aspaj,
      Kuh-i-Gabr, Dahnah, Búghín, Bassab, Radk. The position of Kuh Banán is
      stated to lie between Bahabád (a place also mentioned by Yáḳút as producing
      <em>Tutia</em>) and Ráví, but this does not help us, and for approximate position
      we can only fall back on the note in Mr. Abbott’s field-book, as published
      in the <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite>, viz. that the <em>District</em> lay in the mountains E.S.E.
      from a caravanserai 10 miles S.E. of Gudran. To get the seven marches of
      Polo’s Itinerary we must carry the <em>Town</em> of Kuh Banán as far north as this
      indication can possibly admit, for Abbott made only five and a half marches
      from the spot where this observation was made to Kermán. Perhaps Polo’s
      route deviated for the sake of the fresh water. That a district, such as
      Mr. Abbott’s Report speaks of, should lie unnoticed, in a tract which our
      maps represent as part of the Great Desert, shows again how very defective
      our geography of Persia still is.</p>

    <p>[“During the next stage to Darband, we passed ruins that I believe to be
      those of Marco Polo’s ‘Cobinan’ as the modern Kúhbenán does not at all
      fit in with the great traveller’s description, and it is just as well to
      remember that in the East the caravan routes seldom change.” (Captain P. M.
      Sykes, <cite>Geog. Jour.</cite> X. p. 580.—See <cite>Persia</cite>, ch. xxiii.)</p>

    <p>Kuh Banán has been visited by Mr. E. Stack, of the Indian Civil Service.

    <p><a id="Note_XXI12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXI12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—<em>Tutty</em> (<i>i.e.</i> Tutia) is in modern English an impure oxide of
      zinc, collected from the flues where brass is made; and this appears to
      be precisely what Polo describes, unless it be that in his account the
      production of tutia from an ore of zinc is represented as the object and
      not an accident of the process. What he says reads almost like a condensed
      translation of Galen’s account of <em>Pompholyx</em> and <em>Spodos</em>: “Pompholyx
      is produced in copper-smelting as <em>Cadmia</em> is; and it is also produced
      from Cadmia (carbonate of zinc) when put in the furnace, as is done (for
      instance) in Cyprus. The master of the works there, having no copper ready
      for smelting, ordered some pompholyx to be prepared from cadmia in my
      presence. Small pieces of cadmia were thrown into the fire in front of
      the copper-blast. The furnace top was covered, with no vent at the crown,
      and intercepted the soot of the roasted cadmia. This, when collected,
      constitutes <em>Pompholyx</em>, whilst that which falls on the hearth is called
      <em>Spodos</em>, a great deal of which is got in copper-smelting.” Pompholyx, he
      adds, is an ingredient in salves for eye discharges and pustules. (<cite>Galen,
      De Simpl. Medic.</cite>, p. ix. in Latin ed., Venice, 1576.) Matthioli, after
      quoting this, says that Pompholyx was commonly known in the laboratories by
      the Arabic name of <em>Tutia</em>. I see that pure oxide of zinc is stated to form
      in modern practice a valuable eye-ointment.</p>

    <p>Teixeira speaks of tutia as found only in Kermán, in a range of mountains
      twelve parasangs from the capital. The ore got here was kneaded with
      water, and set to bake in crucibles in a potter’s kiln. When well baked,
      the crucibles were lifted and emptied, and the <em>tutia</em> carried in boxes
      to Hormuz for sale. This corresponds with a modern account in Milburne,
      which says that the tutia imported to India from the Gulf is made from an
      argillaceous ore of zinc, which is moulded into tubular cakes, and baked
      to a moderate hardness. The accurate Garcia da Horta is wrong for once in
      saying that the tutia of Kermán is no mineral, but the ash of a certain
      tree called <em>Goan</em>.</p>

    <p>(<cite>Matth. on Dioscorides</cite>, Ven. 1565, pp. 1338–40; <cite>Teixeira, Relacion de
      Persia</cite>, p. 121; <cite>Milburne’s Or. Commerce</cite>, I. 139; <cite>Garcia</cite>, f. 21 v.;
      <cite>Eng. Cyc.</cite>, art. <cite>Zinc</cite>.)</p>

    <p>[General A. Houtum-Schindler (<cite>Jour. R. As. Soc.</cite> N.S. XIII. October, 1881,
      p. 497) says: “The name Tútíá for collyrium is now not used in Kermán.
      Tútíá, when the name stands alone, is sulphate of copper, which in other
      parts of Persia is known as Kát-i-Kebúd; Tútíá-i-sabz (green Tútíá) is
      sulphate of iron, also called Záj-i-síyah. A piece of Tútíá-i-zard (yellow
      Tútíá) shown to me was alum, generally called Záj-i-safíd; and a piece of
      Tútíá-í-safíd (white Tútíá) seemed to be an argillaceous zinc ore. Either
      of these may have been the earth mentioned by Marco Polo as being put into
      the furnace. The lampblack used as collyrium is always called Surmah. This
      at Kermán itself is the soot produced by the flame of wicks, steeped in
      castor oil or goat’s fat, upon earthenware saucers. In the high mountainous
      districts of the province, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>Kúbenán, Páríz, and others, Surmah is the soot
      of the Gavan plant (Garcia’s goan). This plant, a species of Astragalus,
      is on those mountains very fat and succulent; from it also exudes the
      Tragacanth gum. The soot is used dry as an eye-powder, or, mixed with
      tallow, as an eye-salve. It is occasionally collected on iron gratings.</p>

    <p>“Tútíá is the Arabicised word dúdhá, Persian for smokes.</p>

    <p>“The Shems-ul-loghát calls Tútíá a medicine for eyes, and a stone used for
      the fabrication of Surmah. The Tohfeh says Tútíá is of three kinds—yellow
      and blue mineral Tútíá, Tútíá-i-qalam (collyrium) made from roots, and
      Tútíá resulting from the process of smelting copper ore. ‘The best
      Tútíá-i-qalam comes from Kermán.’ It adds, ‘Some authors say Surmah is
      sulphuret of antimony, others say it is a composition of iron’; I should
      say any <em>black</em> composition used for the eyes is Surmah, be it lampblack,
      antimony, iron, or a mixture of all.</p>

    <p>“Teixeira’s Tútíá was an impure oxide of zinc, perhaps the above-mentioned
      Tútíá-i-safíd, baked into cakes; it was probably the East India Company’s
      Lapis Tútíá, also called Tutty. The Company’s Tutenague and Tutenage,
      occasionally confounded with Tutty, was the so-called ‘Chinese Copper,’ an
      alloy of copper, zinc, and iron, brought from China.”</p>

    <p>Major Sykes (ch. xxiii.) writes: “I translated Marco’s description of
      <em>tutia</em> (which is also the modern Persian name), to a khán of Kubenán,
      and he assured me that the process was the same to-day; spodium he knew
      nothing about, but the sulphate of zinc is found in the hills to the east
      of Kubenán.”</p>

    <p>Heyd (<cite>Com.</cite> II. p. 675) says in a note: <span lang="fr">“Il résulte de l’ensemble de ce
      passage que les matières désignées par Marco Polo sous le nom de ‘espodie’
      (spodium) étaient des scories métalliques; en général, le mot spodium
      désigne les résidus de la combustion des matières végétales ou des os (de
      l’ivoire).”</span>—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of a certain Desert that continues for eight days’ Journey.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> you depart from this City of Cobinan, you find yourself again in a
    Desert of surpassing aridity, which lasts for some eight days; here are
    neither fruits nor trees to be seen, and what water there is is bitter and
    bad, so that you have to carry both food and water. The cattle must needs
    drink the bad water, will they nill they, because of their great thirst.
    At the end of those eight days you arrive at a Province which is called
    <span class="smcap">Tonocain</span>. It has a good many towns and villages, and forms the extremity
    of Persia towards the North.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXII11" href="#Note_XXII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> It also contains an immense plain on
    which is found the <span class="smcap">Arbre Sol</span>, which we Christians call the <em>Arbre Sec</em>; and
    I will tell you what it is like. It is a tall and thick tree, having the
    bark on one side green and the other white; and it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>produces a rough husk
    like that of a chestnut, but without anything in it. The wood is yellow
    like box, and very strong, and there are no other trees near it nor within
    a hundred miles of it, except on one side, where you find trees within
    about ten miles’ distance. And there, the people of the country tell you,
    was fought the battle between Alexander and King Darius.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXII12" href="#Note_XXII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>The towns and villages have great abundance of everything good, for the
    climate is extremely temperate, being neither very hot nor very cold.
    The natives all worship Mahommet, and are a very fine-looking people,
    especially the women, who are surpassingly beautiful.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—All that region has been described as “a country divided into
      deserts that are salt, and deserts that are not salt.” (<cite>Vigne</cite>, I. 16.)
      <em>Tonocain</em>, as we have seen (<a href="#Note_XV11">ch. xv. note 1</a>), is the Eastern Kuhistan of
      Persia, but extended by Polo, it would seem to include the whole of Persian
      Khorasan. No city in particular is indicated as visited by the traveller,
      but the view I take of the position of the <em>Arbre Sec</em>, as well as his
      route through Kuh-Banán, would lead me to suppose that he reached the
      Province of <span class="smcap">Tun-o-Kain</span> about Tabbas.</p>

    <p>[“Marco Polo has been said to have traversed a portion of (the
      Dash-i-Kavir, great Salt Desert) on his supposed route from Tabbas to
      Damghan, about 1272; although it is more probable that he marched further
      to the east, and crossed the northern portion of the Dash-i-Lut, Great Sand
      Desert, separating Khorasan in the south-east from Kermán, and occupying a
      sorrowful parallelogram between the towns of Neh and Tabbas on the north,
      and Kermán and Yezd on the south.” (Curzon, <cite>Persia</cite>, II. pp. 248 and
      251.) Lord Curzon adds in a note (p. 248): “The Tunogan of the text which
      was originally mistaken for Damghan, is correctly explained by Yule as
      Tun-o- (<i>i.e.</i> and) Káin.” Major Sykes writes (ch. xxiii.): “The section of
      the Lut has not hitherto been rediscovered, but I know that it is desert
      throughout, and it is practically certain that Marco ended these unpleasant
      experiences at Tabas, 150 miles from Kubenán. To-day the district is known
      as Tun-o-Tabas, Káin being independent of it.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXII12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—This is another subject on which a long and somewhat discursive
      note is inevitable.</p>

    <p>One of the Bulletins of the Soc. de Géographie (sér. III. tom. iii. p. 187)
      contains a perfectly inconclusive endeavour, by M. Roux de Rochelle, to
      identify the <em>Arbre Sec</em> or <em>Arbre Sol</em> with a manna-bearing oak alluded
      to by Q. Curtius as growing in Hyrcania. There can be no doubt that the
      tree described is, as Marsden points out, a <em>Chínár</em> or Oriental Plane. Mr.
      Ernst Meyer, in his learned <cite>Geschichte der Botanik</cite> (Königsberg, 1854–57,
      IV. 123), objects that Polo’s description of the <em>wood</em> does not answer to
      that tree. But, with due allowance, compare with his whole account that
      which Olearius gives of the Chinar, and say if the same tree be not meant.
      “The trees are as tall as the pine, and have very large leaves, closely
      resembling those of the vine. The fruit looks like a chestnut, but has
      no kernel, so it is not eatable. The wood is of a very brown colour, and
      full of veins; the Persians employ it for doors and window-shutters, and
      when these are rubbed with oil they are incomparably handsomer than our
      walnut-wood joinery.” (I. 526.) The Chinar-wood is used in Kashmir for
      gunstocks.</p>

    <p>The whole tenor of the passage seems to imply that some eminent
      <em>individual</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>Chinar is meant. The appellations given to it vary in the
      different texts. In the G.&nbsp;T. it is styled in this passage, “The <em>Arbre
      Seule</em> which the Christians call the <em>Arbre Sec</em>,” whilst in ch. cci.
      of the same (<i>infra</i>, Bk. IV. ch. v.) it is called “<em>L’Arbre Sol</em>, which
      in the Book of Alexander is called <em>L’Arbre Seche</em>.” Pauthier has here
      “<em>L’Arbre Solque</em>, que nous appelons <em>L’Arbre Sec</em>,” and in the later
      passage “<em>L’Arbre Seul</em>, que le Livre Alexandre appelle <em>Arbre Sec</em>;”
      whilst Ramusio has here “<em>L’Albero del Sole</em> che si chiama per i Cristiani
      <em>L’Albor Secco</em>,” and does not contain the later passage. So also I think
      all the old Latin and French printed texts, which are more or less based on
      Pipino’s version, have “The <em>Tree of the Sun</em>, which the Latins call the
      <em>Dry Tree</em>.”</p>

    <p>[G. Capus says (<cite>A travers le roy. de Tamerlan</cite>, p. 296) that he found
      at Khodjakent, the remains of an enormous plane-tree or <em>Chinar</em>, which
      measured no less than 48 metres (52 yards) in circumference at the base,
      and 9 metres diameter inside the rotten trunk; a dozen tourists from
      Tashkent one day feasted inside, and were all at ease.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Pauthier, building as usual on the reading of his own text (<cite>Solque</cite>),
      endeavours to show that this odd word represents <em>Thoulk</em>, the Arabic name
      of a tree to which Forskal gave the title of <i>Ficus Vasta</i>, and this Ficus
      Vasta he will have to be the same as the Chinar. <i>Ficus Vasta</i> would be a
      strange name surely to give to a Plane-tree, but Forskal may be acquitted
      of such an eccentricity. The <em>Tholaḳ</em> (for that seems to be the proper
      vocalisation) is a tree of Arabia Felix, very different from the Chinar,
      for it is the well-known Indian Banyan, or a closely-allied species, as
      may be seen in Forskal’s description. The latter indeed says that the
      Arab botanists called it <em>Delb</em>, and that (or <em>Dulb</em>) is really a synonym
      for the Chinar. But De Sacy has already commented upon this supposed
      application of the name Delb to the <em>Tholaḳ</em> as erroneous. (See <cite>Flora
      Aegyptiaco-Arabica</cite>, pp. cxxiv. and 179; <cite>Abdallatif, Rel. de l’Egypte</cite>, p.
      80; <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> VIII. 275; <cite>Ritter</cite>, VI. 662, 679.)</p>

    <p>The fact is that the <em>Solque</em> of M. Pauthier’s text is a mere copyist’s
      error in the reduplication of the pronoun <em>que</em>. In his chief MS. which
      he cites as A (No. 10,260 of Bibl. Nationale, now <cite>Fr</cite>. 5631) we can even
      see how this might easily happen, for one line ends with <em>Solque</em> and the
      next begins with <em>que</em>. The true reading is, I doubt not, that which this
      MS. points to, and which the G. Text gives us in the second passage quoted
      above, viz. <em>Arbre</em> <span class="smcap">Sol</span>, occurring in Ramusio as <em>Albero del</em> <span class="smcap">Sole</span>. To make
      this easier of acceptation I must premise two remarks: first, that <em>Sol</em> is
      “the Sun” in both Venetian and Provençal; and, secondly, that in the French
      of that age the prepositional sign is not <em>necessary</em> to the genitive.
      Thus, in Pauthier’s own text we find in one of the passages quoted above,
      “<i lang="fr">Le Livre Alexandre</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Liber Alexandri;” elsewhere, “<i lang="fr">Cazan le fils
      Argon</i>,” “<i lang="fr">à la mère sa femme</i>,” “<i lang="fr">Le corps Monseigneur Saint Thomas si est
      en ceste Province</i>;” in Joinville, “<i lang="fr">le commandemant Mahommet</i>”, “<i lang="fr">ceux de
      la</i> Haulequa <i lang="fr">estoient logiez entour les héberges le soudanc, et establiz
      pour le cors le soudanc garder</i>;” in Baudouin de Sebourc, “<i lang="fr">De l’amour
      Bauduin esprise et enflambée</i>.”</p>

    <p>Moreover it is the <span class="smcap">Tree of the Sun</span> that is prominent in the legendary
      History of Alexander, a fact sufficient in itself to rule the reading. A
      character in an old English play says:—</p>

    <p>These oracular Trees of the Sun and Moon, somewhere on the confines
      of India, appear in all the fabulous histories of Alexander, from the
      Pseudo-Callisthenes downwards. Thus Alexander is made to tell the story
      in a letter to Aristotle: “Then came some of the towns-people and said,
      ‘We have to show thee something passing strange, O King, and worth thy
      visiting; for we can show thee trees that talk with human speech.’ So they
      led me to a certain park, in the midst of which were the Sun and Moon, and
      round about them a guard of priests of the Sun and Moon. And there stood
      the two trees of which they had spoken, like unto cypress trees; and round
      about them were trees like the myrobolans of Egypt, and with similar fruit.
      And I addressed the two trees that were in the midst of the park, the one
      which was male in the Masculine gender, and the one that was female in
      the Feminine gender. And the name of the Male Tree was the Sun, and of
      the female Tree the Moon, names which were in that language <em>Muthu</em> and
      <em>Emaūsae</em>.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And the stems were clothed with the skins of animals; the
      male tree with the skins of he-beasts, and the female tree with the skins
      of she-beasts.... And at the setting of the Sun, a voice, speaking in the
      Indian tongue, came forth from the (Sun) Tree; and I ordered the Indians
      who were with me to interpret it. But they were afraid and would not,” etc.
      (<cite>Pseudo-Callisth.</cite> ed. Müller, III. 17.)</p>

    <p>The story as related by Firdusi keeps very near to the Greek as just
      quoted, but does not use the term “Tree of the Sun.” The chapter of the
      Sháh Námeh containing it is entitled <cite>Dídan Sikandar dirakht-i-goyárá</cite>,
      “Alexander’s interview with the Speaking Tree.” (<cite>Livre des Rois</cite>, V. 229.)
      In the <cite>Chanson d’Alixandre</cite> of Lambert le Court and Alex. de Bernay, these
      trees are introduced as follows:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“‘Signor,’ fait Alixandre, ‘je vus voel demander,</div>
          <div class="i1">Se des merveilles d’Inde me saves rien conter.’</div>
          <div class="i1">Cil li ont respondu: ‘Se tu vius escouter</div>
          <div class="i1">Ja te dirons merveilles, s’es poras esprover.</div>
          <div class="i1">La sus en ces desers pues ii Arbres trover</div>
          <div class="i1">Qui c pies ont de haut, et de grossor sunt per.</div>
          <div class="i1">Li Solaus et La Lune les ont fait si serer</div>
          <div class="i1">Que sevent tous langages et entendre et parler.’”</div>
          <div class="i25">(Ed. 1861 (Dinan), p. 357.)</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Maundevile informs us precisely where these trees are: “A 15 journeys in
      lengthe, goynge be the Deserts of the tother side of the Ryvere Beumare,”
      if one could only <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>tell where that is!<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> A mediæval chronicler also tells
      us that Ogerus the Dane (<em>temp. Caroli Magni</em>) conquered all the parts
      beyond sea from Hierusalem to the Trees of the Sun. In the old Italian
      romance also of <cite>Guerino detto il Meschino</cite>, still a chapbook in S. Italy,
      the Hero (ch. lxiii.) visits the Trees of the Sun and Moon. But this is
      mere imitation of the Alexandrian story, and has nothing of interest.
      (<cite>Maundevile</cite>, pp. 297–298; <cite>Fasciculus Temporum</cite> in <cite>Germ. Script.
      Pistorii Nidani</cite>, II.)</p>

    <p>It will be observed that the letter ascribed to Alexander describes the
      two oracular trees as resembling two cypress-trees. As such the Trees of
      the Sun and Moon are represented on several extant ancient medals, <i>e.g.</i>
      on two struck at Perga in Pamphylia in the time of Aurelian. And Eastern
      story tells us of two vast cypress-trees, sacred among the Magians, which
      grew in Khorasan, one at Kashmar near Turshiz, and the other at Farmad near
      Tuz, and which were said to have risen from shoots that Zoroaster brought
      from Paradise. The former of these was sacrilegiously cut down by the order
      of the Khalif Motawakkil, in the 9th century. The trunk was despatched to
      Baghdad on rollers at a vast expense, whilst the branches alone formed a
      load for 1300 camels. The night that the convoy reached within one stage of
      the palace, the Khalif was cut in pieces by his own guards. This tree was
      said to be 1450 years old, and to measure 33¾ cubits in girth. The locality
      of <em>this</em> “Arbor Sol” we see was in Khorasan, and possibly its fame may
      have been transferred to a representative of another species. The plane,
      as well as the cypress, was one of the distinctive trees of the Magian
      Paradise.</p>

    <p>In the Peutingerian Tables we find in the N.E. of Asia the rubric “<i lang="la">Hic
      Alexander Responsum accepit</i>,” which looks very like an allusion to the
      tale of the Oracular Trees. If so, it is remarkable as a suggestion of
      the antiquity of the Alexandrian Legends, though the rubric may of course
      be an interpolation. The Trees of the Sun and Moon appear as located in
      India Ultima to the east of Persia, in a map which is found in MSS. (12th
      century) of the <cite>Floridus</cite> of <cite>Lambertus</cite>; and they are indicated more or
      less precisely in several maps of the succeeding centuries. (<cite>Ouseley’s
      Travels</cite>, I. 387; <cite>Dabistan</cite>, I. 307–308; <cite>Santarem, H. de la Cosmog.</cite> II.
      189, III. 506–513, etc.)</p>

    <p>Nothing could show better how this legend had possessed men in the Middle
      Ages than the fact that Vincent of Beauvais discerns an allusion to these
      Trees of the Sun and Moon in the blessing of Moses on Joseph (as it runs in
      the Vulgate), “<i lang="la">de pomis fructuum Solis ac Lunae</i>.” (Deut. xxxiii. 14.)</p>

    <p>Marco has mixt up this legend of the Alexandrian Romance, on the authority,
      as we shall see reason to believe, of some of the recompilers of that
      Romance, with a famous subject of <em>Christian</em> Legend in that age, the <span class="smcap">Arbre
      Sec</span> or Dry Tree, one form of which is related by Maundevile and by Johan
      Schiltberger. “A lytille fro Ebron,” says the former, “is the Mount of
      Mambre, of the whyche the Valeye taketh his name. And there is a Tree of
      Oke that the Saracens clepen <em>Dirpe</em>, that is of Abraham’s Tyme, the which
      men clepen <span class="smcap">the Drye Tree</span>.” [Schiltberger adds that the heathen call it
      <em>Kurru Thereck</em>, <i>i.e.</i> (Turkish) <em>Ḳúrú Dirakht</em> = Dry Tree.] “And theye seye
      that it hathe ben there sithe the beginnynge of the World; and was sumtyme
      grene and bare Leves, unto the Tyme that Oure Lord dyede on the Cros; and
      thanne it dryede; and so dyden alle the Trees that weren thanne in the

      and kepen it fulle besyly. And alle be it so that it be drye, natheless yit
      he berethe great vertue,” etc.</p>

    <p>The tradition seems to have altered with circumstances, for a traveller
      of nearly two centuries later (Friar Anselmo, 1509) describes the oak of
      Abraham at Hebron <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>as a tree of dense and verdant foliage: “The Saracens
      make their devotions at it, and hold it in great veneration, for it has
      remained thus green from the days of Abraham until now; and they tie scraps
      of cloth on its branches inscribed with some of their writing, and believe
      that if any one were to cut a piece off that tree he would die within the
      year.” Indeed even before Maundevile’s time Friar Burchard (1283) had
      noticed that though the famous old tree was dry, another had sprung from
      its roots. And it still has a representative.</p>

    <p>As long ago as the time of Constantine a fair was held under the Terebinth
      of Mamre, which was the object of many superstitious rites and excesses.
      The Emperor ordered these to be put a stop to, and a church to be
      erected at the spot. In the time of Arculph (end of 7th century) the dry
      trunk still existed under the roof of this church; just as the immortal
      Banyan-tree of Prág exists to this day in a subterranean temple in the Fort
      of Allahabad.</p>

    <p>It is evident that the story of the Dry Tree had got a great vogue in the
      13th century. In the <cite>Jus du Pelerin</cite>, a French drama of Polo’s age, the
      Pilgrim says:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“S’ai puis en maint bon lieu et à maint saint esté,</div>
          <div class="i1">S’ai esté au <em>Sec-Arbre</em> et dusc’à Duresté.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">And in another play of slightly earlier date (<cite>Le Jus de St. Nicolas</cite>),
      the King of Africa, invaded by the Christians, summons all his allies
      and feudatories, among whom appear the Admirals of Coine (<em>Iconium</em>)
      and Orkenie (<em>Hyrcania</em>), and the <em>Amiral d’outre l’Arbre-Sec</em> (as it
      were of “the Back of Beyond”) in whose country the only current coin is
      millstones! Friar Odoric tells us that he heard at Tabriz that the <em>Arbor
      Secco</em> existed in a mosque of that city; and Clavijo relates a confused
      story about it in the same locality. Of the <em>Dürre Baum</em> at Tauris there
      is also a somewhat pointless legend in a Cologne MS. of the 14th century,
      professing to give an account of the East. There are also some curious
      verses concerning a mystical <em>Dürre Bom</em> quoted by Fabricius from an old
      Low German Poem; and we may just allude to that other mystic <em>Arbor Secco</em>
      of Dante—</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">though the dark symbolism in the latter case seems to have a different
      bearing.</p>

    <p>But why does Polo bring this <em>Arbre Sec</em> into connection with the Sun
      Tree of the Alexandrian Legend? I cannot answer this to my own entire
      satisfaction, but I can show that such a connection had been imagined in
      his time.</p>

    <p>Paulin Paris, in a notice of MS. No. 6985. (<cite>Fonds Ancien</cite>) of the National
      Library, containing a version of the <cite>Chansons de Geste d’Alixandre</cite>,
      based upon the work of L. Le Court and Alex. de Bernay, but with additions
      of later date, notices amongst these latter the visit of Alexander to
      the Valley Perilous, where he sees a variety of wonders, among others
      the <em>Arbre des Pucelles</em>. Another tree at a great distance from the last
      is called the <span class="smcap">Arbre Sec</span>, and reveals to Alexander the secret of the fate
      which attends him in Babylon. (<cite>Les MSS. Français de la Bibl. du Roi</cite>,
      III. 105.)<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Again the English version of <cite>King Alisaundre</cite>, published in
      Weber’s Collection, shows clearly enough that in <em>its</em> French original the
      term <em>Arbre Sec</em> was applied to the Oracular Trees, though the word has
      been miswritten, and misunderstood by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>Weber. The King, as in the Greek and
      French passages already quoted, meeting two old churls, asks if they know
      of any marvel in those parts:—</p>

    </div>

    <p>Weber’s glossary gives “<em>Arbeset</em> = Strawberry Tree, <em>arbous, arbousier,
      arbutus</em>”; but that is nonsense.</p>

    <p>Further, in the French Prose Romance of Alexander, which is contained
      in the fine volume in the British Museum known as the Shrewsbury Book
      (Reg. XV. e. 6), though we do not find the Arbre Sec so named, we find
      it described and pictorially represented. The Romance (fol. xiiii. v.)
      describes Alexander and his chief companions as ascending a certain
      mountain by 2500 steps which were attached to a golden chain. At the top
      they find the golden Temple of the Sun and an old man asleep within. It
      goes on:—</p>

    <p lang="fr">“Quant le viellart les vit si leur demanda s’ils vouloient veoir les
      Arbres sacrez de la Lune et du Soleil que nous annuncent les choses qui
      sont à avenir. Quant Alexandre ouy ce si fut rempli de mult grant ioye.
      Si lui respondirent, ‘Ouye sur, nous les voulons veoir.’ Et cil lui dist,
      ‘Se tu es nez de prince malle et de femelle il te convient entrer en
      celui lieu.’ Et Alexandre lui respondi, ‘Nous somes nez de compagne malle
      et de femelle.’ Dont se leve le viellart du lit ou il gesoit, et leur
      dist, ‘Hostez vos vestemens et vos chauces.’ Et Tholomeus et Antigonus et
      Perdiacas le suivrent. Lors comencèrent à aler parmy la forest qui estoit
      enclose en merveilleux labour. Illec trouvèrent les arbres semblables à
      loriers et oliviers. Et estoient de cent pies de haults, et decouroit
      d’eulz incens ypobaume<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> à grant quantité. Après entrèrent plus avant
      en la forest, et trouvèrent <em>une arbre durement hault qui n’avoit ne
      fueille ne fruit</em>. Si seoit sur cet arbre une grant oysel qui avoit en
      son chief une creste qui estoit semblable au paon, et les plumes du col
      resplendissants come fin or. Et avoit la couleur de rose. Dont lui dist le
      viellart, ‘Cet oysel dont vous vous merveillez est appelés Fenis, lequel
      n’a nul pareil en tout le monde.’ Dont passèrent outre, et allèrent aux
      Arbres du Soleil et de la Lune. Et quant ils y furent venus, si leur dist
      le viellart, ‘Regardez en haut, et pensez en votre coeur ce que vous
      vouldrez demander, et ne le dites de la bouche.’ Alisandre luy demanda en
      quel language donnent les Arbres response aux gens. Et il lui respondit,
      ‘L’Arbre du Soleil commence à parler Indien.’ Dont baisa Alexandre les
      arbres, et comença en son ceur à penser s’il conquesteroit tout le monde
      et retourneroit en Macedonie atout son ost. Dont lui respondit l’Arbre du
      Soleil, ‘Alexandre tu seras Roy de tout le monde, mais Macedonie tu ne
      verras jamais,’” etc.</p>

    <p>The appearance of the Arbre Sec in Maps of the 15th century, such as those
      of Andrea Bianco (1436) and Fra Mauro (1459), may be ascribed to the
      influence of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>Polo’s own work; but a more genuine evidence of the prevalence
      of the legend is found in the celebrated Hereford Map constructed in the
      13th century by Richard de Haldingham. This, in the vicinity of India and
      the Terrestrial Paradise, exhibits a Tree with the rubric “<em>Albor Balsami
      est Arbor Sicca</em>.”</p>

    <p>The legends of the Dry Tree were probably spun out of the words of the
      Vulgate in Ezekiel xvii. 24: <span lang="la">“<em>Humiliavi lignum sublime et exaltavi lignum
      humile; et siccavi lignum viride</em> et frondescere feci lignum aridum.”</span>
      Whether the <em>Rue de l’Arbre Sec</em> in Paris derives its name from the legend
      I know not. [The name of the street is taken from an old sign-board; some
      say it is derived from the gibbet placed in the vicinity, but this is more
      than doubtful.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The actual tree to which Polo refers in the text was probably one of those
      so frequent in Persia, to which age, position, or accident has attached
      a character of sanctity, and which are styled <em>Dirakht-i-Fazl</em>, Trees of
      Excellence or Grace, and often receive titles appropriate to Holy Persons.
      Vows are made before them, and pieces torn from the clothes of the votaries
      are hung upon the branches or nailed to the trunks. To a tree of such a
      character, imposing in decay, Lucan compares Pompey:</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span></p>

    <p class="noindent">The Tree of Mamre was evidently precisely one of this class; and those
      who have crossed the Suez Desert before railway days will remember such
      a <em>Dirakht-i-Fazl</em>, an aged mimosa, a veritable <em>Arbre Seul</em> (could we
      accept that reading), that stood just half-way across the Desert, streaming
      with the <i lang="la">exuviae veteres</i> of Mecca Pilgrims. The majority of such holy
      trees in Persia appear to be Plane-trees. Admiration for the beauty of
      this tree seems to have occasionally risen into superstitious veneration
      from a very old date. Herodotus relates that the Carians, after their
      defeat by the Persians on the Marsyas, rallied in the sacred grove of
      Plane-trees at Labranda. And the same historian tells how, some years
      later, Xerxes on his march to Greece decorated a beautiful Chinar with
      golden ornaments. Mr. Hamilton, in the same region, came on the remains of
      a giant of the species, which he thought might possibly be the very same.
      Pliny rises to enthusiasm in speaking of some noble Plane-trees in Lycia
      and elsewhere. Chardin describes one grand and sacred specimen, called
      King Hosain’s Chinar, and said to be more than 1000 years old, in a suburb
      of Ispahan, and another hung with amulets, rags, and tapers in a garden
      at Shiraz.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> One sacred tree mentioned by the Persian geographer Hamd
      Allah as distinguishing the grave of a holy man at Bostam in Khorasan (the
      species is not named, at least by Ouseley, from whom I borrow this) comes
      into striking relation with the passage in our text. The story went that it
      had been the staff of Mahomed; as such it had been transmitted through many
      generations, until it was finally deposited in the grave of Abu Abdallah
      Dásitáni, where it struck root and put forth branches. And it is explicitly
      called <em>Dirakht-i-Khushk</em>, <i>i.e.</i> literally <i>L’ARBRE SEC</i>.</p>

    <p>This last legend belongs to a large class. The staff of Adam, which was
      created in the twilight of the approaching Sabbath, was bestowed on him in
      Paradise and handed down successively to Enoch and the line of Patriarchs.
      After the death of Joseph it was set in Jethro’s garden, and there grew
      untouched, till Moses came and got his rod from it. In another form of the
      legend it is Seth who gets a branch of the Tree of Life, and from this
      Moses afterwards obtains his rod of power. These Rabbinical stories seem in
      later times to have been developed into the Christian legends of the wood
      destined to form the Cross, such as they are told in the Golden Legend or
      by Godfrey of Viterbo, and elaborated in Calderon’s <cite>Sibila del Oriente</cite>.
      Indeed, as a valued friend who has consulted the latter for me suggests,
      probably all the Arbre Sec Legends of Christendom bore mystic reference to
      the Cross. In Calderon’s play the Holy Rood, seen in vision, is described
      as a Tree:—</p>

    <p class="noindent">There are several Dry-Tree stories among the wonders of Buddhism; one is
      that of a sacred tree visited by the Chinese pilgrims to India, which
      had grown from the twig which Sakya, in Hindu fashion, had used as a
      tooth-brush; and I think there is a like story in our own country of the
      Glastonbury Thorn having grown from the staff of Joseph of Arimathea.</p>

    <p>[“St Francis’ Church is a large pile, neere which, yet a little without
      the Citty, growes a tree which they report in their legend grew from the
      Saint’s Staff, which on <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>going to sleepe he fixed in the ground, and at his
      waking found it had grown a large tree. They affirm that the wood of its
      decoction cures sundry diseases.” (<cite>Evelyn’s Diary</cite>, October, 1644.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>In the usual form of the mediæval legend, Adam, drawing near his end,
      sends Seth to the gate of Paradise, to seek the promised Oil of Mercy.
      The Angel allows Seth to put his head in at the gate. Doing so (as an old
      English version gives it)—</p>

    <p>The Angel gives Seth three kernels from the fruit of the Tree. Seth returns
      home and finds his father dead. He buries him in <em>the valley of Hebron</em>,
      and places the three grains under his tongue. A triple shoot springs up of
      Cedar, Cypress, and Pine, symbolising the three Persons of the Trinity. The
      three eventually unite into one stem, and this tree survives in various
      forms, and through various adventures in connection with the Scripture
      History, till it is found at the bottom of the Pool of Bethesda, to which
      it had imparted healing Virtue, and is taken thence to form the Cross on
      which Our Lord suffered.</p>

    <p>The English version quoted above is from a MS. of the 14th century in the

      the words. The French citation is from a MS. in the Vienna Library, from
      which extracts are given by Sign. Adolfo Mussafia in his curious and
      learned tract (<cite>Sulla Legenda del Legno della Croce</cite>, Vienna, 1870), which
      gives a full account of the fundamental legend and its numerous variations.
      The examination of these two works, particularly Sign. Mussafia’s, gives
      an astonishing impression of the copiousness with which such Christian
      Mythology, as it may fairly be called, was diffused and multiplied. There
      are in the paper referred to notices of between fifty and sixty different
      <em>works</em> (not MSS. or <em>copies</em> of works merely) containing this legend in
      various European languages.</p>

    <p>He who injured the holy tree of Bostam, we are told, perished the same
      day: a general belief in regard to those <em>Trees of Grace</em>, of which we
      have already seen instances in regard to the sacred trees of Zoroaster
      and the Oak of Hebron. We find the same belief in Eastern Africa, where
      certain trees, regarded by the natives with superstitious reverence, which
      they express by driving in votive nails and suspending rags, are known
      to the European residents by the vulgar name of <em>Devil Trees</em>. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>Burton
      relates a case of the verification of the superstition in the death of
      an English merchant who had cut down such a tree, and of four members of
      his household. It is the old story which Ovid tells; and the tree which
      Erisichthon felled was a <em>Dirakht-i-Fazl</em>:</p>

      <div class="caption">Chinar, or Oriental Plane.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Though the coincidence with our text of Hamd Allah’s Dry Tree is very
      striking, I am not prepared to lay stress on it as an argument for the
      geographical determination of Marco’s <em>Arbre Sec</em>. His use of the title
      more than once to characterise the whole frontier of Khorasan can hardly
      have been a mere whim of his own: and possibly some explanation of
      that circumstance will yet be elicited from the Persian historians or
      geographers of the Mongol era.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile it is in the vicinity of Bostam or Damghan that I should incline
      to place this landmark. If no one <em>very</em> cogent reason points to this,
      a variety of minor ones do so; such as the direction of the traveller’s
      journey from Kermán through Kuh Banán; the apparent vicinity of a great
      Ismailite fortress, as will be noticed in the next chapter; the connection
      twice indicated (see <cite>Prologue</cite>, <a href="#Note_XVIIIp6">ch. xviii. note 6</a>, and Bk. IV. ch. v.) of
      the Arbre Sec with the headquarters of Ghazan Khan in watching the great
      passes, of which the principal ones debouche at Bostam, at which place
      also buildings erected by Ghazan still exist; and the statement that the
      decisive battle between Alexander and Darius was placed there by local
      tradition. For though no such battle took place in that region, we know
      that Darius was murdered near Hecatompylos. Some place this city west
      of Bostam, near Damghan; others east of it, about Jah Jerm; Ferrier has
      strongly argued for the vicinity of Bostam itself. Firdusi indeed places
      the final battle on the confines of Kermán, and the death of Darius within
      that province. But this could not have been the tradition Polo met with.</p>

    <p>I may add that the temperate climate of Bostam is noticed in words almost
      identical with Polo’s by both Fraser and Ferrier.</p>

    <p>The Chinar abounds in Khorasan (as far as any tree can be said to <em>abound</em>
      in Persia), and even in the Oases of Tun-o-Kain wherever there is water.
      Travellers quoted by Ritter notice Chinars of great size and age at
      Shahrúd, near Bostam, at Meyomid, and at Mehr, west of Sabzawar, which last
      are said to date from the time of Naoshirwan (7th century). There is a town
      to the N.W. of Meshid called <em>Chinárán</em>, “The Planes.” P. Della Valle, we
      may note, calls Tehran “la città dei platani.”</p>

    <p>The following note by De Sacy regarding the Chinar has already been quoted
      by Marsden, and though it may be doubtful whether the term Arbre Sec
      had any relation to the idea expressed, it seems to me too interesting
      to be omitted: “Its sterility seems to have become proverbial among
      certain people of the East. For in a collection of sundry moral sentences
      pertaining to the Sabaeans or Christians of St. John ... we find the
      following: ‘The vainglorious man is like a showy Plane Tree, rich in boughs
      but producing nothing, and affording no fruit to its owner.’” The same
      reproach of sterility is cast at the Plane by Ovid’s Walnut:—</p>

    <p class="noindent">I conclude with another passage from Khanikoff, though put forward in
      special illustration of what I believe to be a mistaken reading (<em>Arbre
      Seul</em>): “Where the Chinar is of spontaneous growth, or occupies the centre
      of a vast and naked plain, this tree is even in our own day invested with
      a quite exceptional veneration, and the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>locality often comes to be called
      ‘The Place of the Solitary Tree.’” (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXIX. 345; <cite>Ferrier</cite>,

    <p>[See in Fr. Zarncke, <cite>Der Priester Johannes</cite>, II., in the chap. <cite>Der Baum
      des Seth</cite>, pp. 127–128, from MS. (14th century) from Cambridge, this
      curious passage (p. 128): <span lang="la">“Tandem rogaverunt eum, ut arborem siccam, de
      qua multum saepe loqui audierant, liceret videre. Quibus dicebat: ‘Non
      est appellata arbor sicca recto nomine, sed arbor Seth, quoniam Seth,
      filius Adae, primi patris nostri, eam plantavit.’ Et ad arborem Seth
      fecit eos ducere, prohibens eos, ne arborem transmearent, sed [si?] ad
      patriam suam redire desiderarent. Et cum appropinquassent, de pulcritudine
      arboris mirati sunt; erat enim magnae immensitatis et miri decoris. Omnium
      enim colorum varietas inerat arbori, condensitas foliorum et fructuum
      diversorum; diversitas avium omnium, quae sub coelo sunt. Folia vero
      invicem se repercutientia dulcissimae melodiae modulamine resonabant, et
      aves amoenos cantus ultra quam credi potest promebant; et odor suavissimus
      profudit eos, ita quod paradisi amoenitate fuisse. Et cum admirantes tantam
      pulcritudinem aspicerent, unus sociorum aliquo eorum maior aetate, cogitans
      [cogitavit?] intra se, quod senior esset et, si inde rediret, cito aliquo
      casu mori posset. Et cum haec secum cogitasset, coepit arborem transire, et
      cum transisset, advocans socios, iussit eos post se ad locum amoenissimum,
      quem ante se videbat plenum deliciis sibi paratum [paratis?] festinare. At
      illi retrogressi sunt ad regem, scilicet presbiterum Iohannem. Quos donis
      amplis ditavit, et qui cum eo morari voluerunt libenter et honorifice
      detinuit. Alii vero ad patriam reversi sunt.”</span>—In common with Marsden and
      Yule, I have no doubt that the <em>Arbre Sec</em> is the <em>Chínár</em>. Odoric places
      it at Tabriz and I have given a very lengthy dissertation on the subject in
      my edition of this traveller (pp. 21–29), to which I must refer the reader,
      to avoid increasing unnecessarily the size of the present publication.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Old Man of the Mountain.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Mulehet</span> is a country in which the Old Man of the Mountain dwelt in former
    days; and the name means “<em>Place of the Aram</em>.” I will tell you his whole
    history as related by Messer Marco Polo, who heard it from several natives
    of that region.</p>

  <p>The Old Man was called in their language <span class="smcap">Aloadin</span>. He had caused a certain
    valley between two mountains to be enclosed, and had turned it into a
    garden, the largest and most beautiful that ever was seen, filled with
    every variety of fruit. In it were erected pavilions and palaces the most
    elegant that can be imagined, all <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>covered with gilding and exquisite
    painting. And there were runnels too, flowing freely with wine and milk
    and honey and water; and numbers of ladies and of the most beautiful
    damsels in the world, who could play on all manner of instruments, and
    sung most sweetly, and danced in a manner that it was charming to behold.
    For the Old Man desired to make his people believe that this was actually
    Paradise. So he had fashioned it after the description that Mahommet gave
    of his Paradise, to wit, that it should be a beautiful garden running with
    conduits of wine and milk and honey and water, and full of lovely women for
    the delectation of all its inmates. And sure enough the Saracens of those
    parts believed that it <em>was</em> Paradise!</p>

  <p>Now no man was allowed to enter the Garden save those whom he intended to
    be his <span class="smcap">Ashishin</span>. There was a Fortress at the entrance to the Garden, strong
    enough to resist all the world, and there was no other way to get in. He
    kept at his Court a number of the youths of the country, from 12 to 20
    years of age, such as had a taste for soldiering, and to these he used to
    tell tales about Paradise, just as Mahommet had been wont to do, and they
    believed in him just as the Saracens believe in Mahommet. Then he would
    introduce them into his garden, some four, or six, or ten at a time, having
    first made them drink a certain potion which cast them into a deep sleep,
    and then causing them to be lifted and carried in. So when they awoke, they
    found themselves in the Garden.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIII11" href="#Note_XXIII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXIII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      1.</a>—Says the venerable Sire de Joinville: “<i lang="fr">Le Vieil de la Montaingne
      ne créoit pas en Mahommet, ainçois créoit en la Loi de Haali, qui fu
      Oncle Mahommet.</i>” This is a crude statement, no doubt, but it has a germ
      of truth. Adherents of the family of ’Ali as the true successors of the
      Prophet existed from the tragical day of the death of Husain, and among
      these, probably owing to the secrecy with which they were compelled to hold
      their allegiance, there was always a tendency to all manner of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>strange
      and mystical doctrines; as in one direction to the glorification of ’Ali
      as a kind of incarnation of the Divinity, a character in which his lineal
      representatives were held in some manner to partake; in another direction
      to the development of Pantheism, and release from all positive creed and
      precepts. Of these Aliites, eventually called <em>Shiáhs</em>, a chief sect, and
      parent of many heretical branches, were the Ismailites, who took their
      name, from the seventh Imam, whose return to earth they professed to expect
      at the end of the World. About <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1090 a branch of the Ismaili stock
      was established by Hassan, son of Sabah, in the mountainous districts of
      Northern Persia; and, before their suppression by the Mongols, 170 years
      later, the power of the quasi-spiritual dynasty which Hassan founded
      had spread over the Eastern Kohistan, at least as far as Ḳáïn. Their
      headquarters were at Alamút (“Eagle’s Nest”), about 32 miles north-east
      of Ḳazwin, and all over the territory which they held they established
      fortresses of great strength. De Sacy seems to have proved that they were
      called <em>Hashíshíya</em> or <em>Hashíshín</em>, from their use of the preparation of
      hemp called <em>Hashísh</em>; and thence, through their system of murder and
      terrorism, came the modern application of the word Assassin. The original
      aim of this system was perhaps that of a kind of <i lang="de">Vehmgericht</i>, to punish
      or terrify orthodox persecutors who were too strong to be faced with the
      sword. I have adopted in the text one of the readings of the G. Text
      <em>Asciscin</em>, as expressing the original word with the greatest accuracy
      that Italian spelling admits. In another author we find it as <em>Chazisii</em>
      (see <cite>Bollandists</cite>, May, vol. ii. p. xi.); Joinville calls them <em>Assacis</em>;
      whilst Nangis and others corrupt the name into <em>Harsacidae</em>, and what not.</p>

    <p>The explanation of the name <span class="smcap">Mulehet</span> as it is in Ramusio, or <em>Mulcete</em>
      as it is in the G. Text (the last expressing in Rusticiano’s Pisan
      tongue the strongly aspirated <em>Mulhĕtĕ</em>), is given by the former: “This
      name of Mulehet is as much as to say in the Saracen tongue ‘<em>The Abode
      of Heretics</em>,’” the fact being that it does represent the Arabic term
      <em>Mulhid</em>, pl. <em>Muláhidah</em>, “Impii, heretici,” which is in the Persian
      histories (as of Rashíduddín and Wassáf) the title most commonly used to
      indicate this community, and which is still applied by orthodox Mahomedans
      to the Nosairis, Druses, and other sects of that kind, more or less kindred
      to the Ismaili. The writer of the <cite>Tabakat-i-Násiri</cite> calls the sectarians
      of Alamút <em>Muláhidat-ul-maut</em>, “Heretics of Death.”<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The curious reading
      of the G. Text which we have preserved “<i lang="fr">vaut à dire des</i> Aram,” should be
      read as we have rendered it. I conceive that Marco was here unconsciously
      using one Oriental term to explain another. For it seems possible to
      explain <em>Aram</em> only as standing for <em>Harám</em>, in the sense of “wicked” or
      “reprobate.”</p>

    <p>In Pauthier’s Text, instead of <i lang="fr">des aram</i>, we find “<i lang="fr">veult dire en
      françois</i> Diex Terrien,” or Terrestrial God. This may have been
      substituted, in the correction of the original rough dictation, from a
      perception that the first expression was unintelligible. The new phrase
      does not indeed convey the meaning of <em>Muláhidah</em>, but it expresses a main
      characteristic of the heretical doctrine. The correction was probably made
      by Polo himself; it is certainly of very early date. For in the romance of
      Bauduin de Sebourc, which I believe dates early in the 14th century, the
      Caliph, on witnessing the extraordinary devotion of the followers of the
      Old Man (see <a href="#Note_XXIV11">note 1, ch. xxiv.</a>), exclaims:</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry" lang="fr">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“Par Mahon ...</div>
          <div class="i1">Vous estes <em>Diex en terre</em>, autre coze n’i a!” (I. p. 360.)</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">So also Fr. Jacopo d’Aqui in the <cite>Imago Mundi</cite>, says of the Assassins:
      “Dicitur iis quod sunt in Paradiso magno <em>Dei Terreni</em>”—expressions, no
      doubt, taken in both cases from Polo’s book.</p>

    <p>Khanikoff, and before him J. R. Forster, have supposed that the name
      <em>Mulehet</em> represents <em>Alamút</em>. But the resemblance is much closer and more
      satisfactory to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span><em>Mulhid</em> or <em>Muláhidah</em>. <em>Mulhet</em> is precisely the name by
      which the kingdom of the Ismailites is mentioned in Armenian history, and
      <em>Mulihet</em> is already applied in the same way by Rabbi Benjamin in the 12th
      century, and by Rubruquis in the 13th. The Chinese narrative of Hulaku’s
      expedition calls it the kingdom of <em>Mulahi</em>. (<cite>Joinville</cite>, p. 138; <cite>J. As.</cite>

      <cite>Nouv. Mélanges</cite>, I. 176; <cite>Gaubil</cite>, p. 128; <cite>Pauthier</cite>, pp. cxxxix.–cxli.;
      <cite>Mon. Hist. Patr. Scriptorum</cite>, III. 1559, Turin, 1848.) [Cf. on <em>Mulehet</em>,
      <em>melahideh</em>, Heretics, plural of <em>molhid</em>, Heretic, my note, pp. 476–482 of
      my ed. of Friar Odoric.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>“Old Man of the Mountain” was the title applied by the Crusaders to the
      chief of that branch of the sect which was settled in the mountains
      north of Lebanon, being a translation of his popular Arabic title
      <cite>Shaikh-ul-Jibal</cite>. But according to Hammer this title properly belonged, as
      Polo gives it, to the Prince of Alamút, who never called himself Sultan,
      Malik, or Amir; and this seems probable, as his territory was known as the
      <em>Balad-ul-Jibal</em>. (See <cite>Abulf.</cite> in <cite>Büsching</cite>, V. 319.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Old Man Used to Train His Assassins.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> therefore they awoke, and found themselves in a place so charming,
    they deemed that it was Paradise in very truth. And the ladies and damsels
    dallied with them to their hearts’ content, so that they had what young men
    would have; and with their own good will they never would have quitted the place.</p>

  <p>Now this Prince whom we call the Old One kept his Court in grand and noble
    style, and made those simple hill-folks about him believe firmly that he
    was a great Prophet. And when he wanted one of his <em>Ashishin</em> to send on
    any mission, he would cause that potion whereof I spoke to be given to one
    of the youths in the garden, and then had him carried into his Palace. So
    when the young man awoke, he found himself in the Castle, and no longer in
    that Paradise; whereat he was not over well pleased. He was then conducted
    to the Old Man’s presence, and bowed before him with great veneration as
    believing himself to be in the presence of a true <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>Prophet. The Prince would
    then ask whence he came, and he would reply that he came from Paradise!
    and that it was exactly such as Mahommet had described it in the Law. This
    of course gave the others who stood by, and who had not been admitted, the
    greatest desire to enter therein.</p>

  <p>So when the Old Man would have any Prince slain, he would say to such a
    youth: “Go thou and slay So and So; and when thou returnest my Angels shall
    bear thee into Paradise. And shouldst thou die, natheless even so will I
    send my Angels to carry thee back into Paradise.” So he caused them to
    believe; and thus there was no order of his that they would not affront
    any peril to execute, for the great desire they had to get back into that
    Paradise of his. And in this manner the Old One got his people to murder
    any one whom he desired to get rid of. Thus, too, the great dread that he
    inspired all Princes withal, made them become his tributaries in order that
    he might abide at peace and amity with them.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIV11" href="#Note_XXIV11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>I should also tell you that the Old Man had certain others under him, who
    copied his proceedings and acted exactly in the same manner. One of these
    was sent into the territory of Damascus, and the other into Curdistan.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIV12" href="#Note_XXIV12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXIV11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIV11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Romantic as this story is, it seems to be precisely the same that
      was current over all the East. It is given by Odoric at length, more
      briefly by a Chinese author, and again from an Arabic source by Hammer in
      the <cite>Mines de l’Orient</cite>.</p>

    <p>The following is the Chinese account as rendered by Rémusat: “The soldiers
      of this country (Mulahi) are veritable brigands. When they see a lusty
      youth, they tempt him with the hope of gain, and bring him to such a point
      that he will be ready to kill his father or his elder brother with his own
      hand. After he is enlisted, they intoxicate him, and carry him in that
      state into a secluded retreat, where he is charmed with delicious music and
      beautiful women. All his desires are satisfied for several days, and then
      (in sleep) he is transported back to his original position. When he awakes,
      they ask what he has seen. He is then informed that if he will become an
      Assassin, he will be rewarded with the same felicity. And with the texts
      and prayers that they teach him they heat him to such a pitch that whatever
      commission be given him he will brave death without regret in order to
      execute it.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

    <p>The Arabic narrative is too long to extract. It is from a kind of
      historical romance called <cite>The Memoirs of Hakim</cite>, the date of which Hammer
      unfortunately omits to give. Its close coincidence in substance with Polo’s
      story is quite remarkable. After a detailed description of the Paradise,
      and the transfer into it of the aspirant under the influence of <em>bang</em>, on
      his awaking and seeing his chief enter, he says, “O chief! am I awake or
      am I dreaming?” To which the chief: “O such an One, take heed that thou
      tell not the dream to any stranger. Know that Ali thy Lord hath vouchsafed
      to show thee the place destined for thee in Paradise.... Hesitate not a
      moment therefore in the service of the Imam who thus deigns to intimate his
      contentment with thee,” and so on.</p>

    <p>William de Nangis thus speaks of the Syrian Shaikh, who alone was known
      to the Crusaders, though one of their historians (<cite>Jacques de Vitry</cite>,
      in <cite>Bongars</cite>, I. 1062) shows knowledge that the headquarters of the
      sect was in Persia: “He was much dreaded far and near, by both Saracens
      and Christians, because he so often caused princes of both classes
      indifferently to be murdered by his emissaries. For he used to bring up
      in his palace youths belonging to his territory, and had them taught a
      variety of languages, and above all things to fear their Lord and obey
      him unto death, which would thus become to them an entrance into the joys
      of Paradise. And whosoever of them thus perished in carrying out his
      Lord’s behests was worshipped as an angel.” As an instance of the implicit
      obedience rendered by the <em>Fidáwí</em> or devoted disciples of the Shaikh, Fra
      Pipino and Marino Sanuto relate that when Henry Count of Champagne (titular
      King of Jerusalem) was on a visit to the Old Man of Syria, one day as they
      walked together they saw some lads in white sitting on the top of a high
      tower. The Shaikh, turning to the Count, asked if he had any subjects as
      obedient as his own? and without giving time for reply made a sign to two
      of the boys, who immediately leapt from the tower, and were killed on the
      spot. The same story is told in the <cite>Cento Novelle Antiche</cite>, as happening
      when the Emperor Frederic was on a visit (imaginary) to the Veglio. And it
      is introduced likewise as an incident in the Romance of Bauduin de Sebourc:</p>

    <p>The following are some of the more notable murders or attempts at murder
      ascribed to the Ismailite emissaries either from Syria or from Persia:—</p>

    <p><span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1092. Nizum-ul-Mulk, formerly the powerful minister of Malik Shah,
      Seljukian sovereign of Persia, and a little later his two sons. 1102. The

      Mosul, in the chief Mosque of Damascus. About 1114. Abul Muzafar ’Ali,
      Wazir of Sanjár Shah, and Chakar Beg, grand-uncle of the latter. 1116.
      Ahmed Yel, Prince of Maragha, at Baghdad, in the presence of Mahomed,
      Sultan of Persia. 1121. The Amir <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>Afdhal, the powerful Wazir of Egypt, at
      Cairo. 1126. Kasim Aksonkor, Prince of Mosul and Aleppo, in the Great
      Mosque at Mosul. 1127. Moyin-uddin, Wazir of Sanjár Shah of Persia. 1129.
      Amír Billah, Khalif of Egypt. 1131. Taj-ul Mulúk Buri, Prince of Damascus.
      1134. Shams-ul-Mulúk, son of the preceding. 1135–38. The Khalif Mostarshid,
      the Khalif Rashíd, and Daùd, Seljukian Prince of Azerbaijan. 1149. Raymond,
      Count of Tripoli. 1191. Kizil Arzlan, Prince of Azerbaijan. 1192. Conrad of
      Montferrat, titular King of Jerusalem; a murder which King Richard has been
      accused of instigating. 1217. Oghulmish, Prince of Hamadán.</p>

    <p>And in 1174 and 1176 attempts to murder the great Saladin. 1271. Attempt
      to murder Ala’uddin Juwaini, Governor of Baghdad, and historian of the
      Mongols. 1272. The attempt to murder Prince Edward of England at Acre.</p>

    <p>In latter years the <em>Fidáwí</em> or Ismailite adepts appear to have let out
      their services simply as hired assassins. Bibars, in a letter to his court
      at Cairo, boasts of using them when needful. A Mahomedan author ascribes
      to Bibars the instigation of the attempt on Prince Edward. (<cite>Makrizi</cite>, II.
      100; <cite>J. As.</cite> XI. 150.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXIV12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIV12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—Hammer mentions as what he chooses to call “Grand Priors” under
      the Shaikh or “Grand Master” at Alamút, the chief, in Syria, one in the
      Kuhistan of E. Persia (Tun-o-Kaïn), one in Kumis (the country about Damghan
      and Bostam), and one in ’Irák; he does not speak of any in Kurdistan.
      Colonel Monteith, however, says, though without stating authority or
      particulars, “There were several divisions of them (the Assassins)
      scattered throughout Syria, <em>Kurdistan</em> (near the Lake of Wan), and Asia
      Minor, but all acknowledging as Imaum or High Priest the Chief residing at
      Alamut.” And it may be noted that Odoric, a generation after Polo, puts the
      Old Man at <em>Millescorte</em>, which looks like <em>Malasgird</em>, north of Lake Van.

  <div class="subh4">How the Old Man came by His End.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> it came to pass, in the year of Christ’s Incarnation, 1252, that Alaü,
    Lord of the Tartars of the Levant, heard tell of these great crimes of
    the Old Man, and resolved to make an end of him. So he took and sent one
    of his Barons with a great Army to that Castle, and they besieged it for
    three years, but they could not take it, so strong was it. And indeed if
    they had had food within it never would have been taken. But after being
    besieged those three years they ran short of victual, and were taken. The
    Old Man was put to death with all his men [and the Castle with its Garden
    of Paradise was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>levelled with the ground]. And since that time he has had
    no successor; and there was an end to all his villainies.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXV11" href="#Note_XXV11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>Now let us go back to our journey.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXV11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXV11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The date in Pauthier is 1242; in the G.&nbsp;T. and in Ramusio 1262.
      Neither is right, nor certainly could Polo have meant the former.</p>

    <p>When Mangku Kaan, after his enthronement (1251), determined at a great
      <em>Kurultai</em> or Diet, on perfecting the Mongol conquests, he entrusted his
      brother Kúblái with the completion of the subjugation of China and the
      adjacent countries, whilst his brother Hulaku received the command of the
      army destined for Persia and Syria. The complaints that came from the
      Mongol officers already in Persia determined him to commence with the
      reduction of the Ismailites, and Hulaku set out from Karakorum in February,
      1254. He proceeded with great deliberation, and the Oxus was not crossed
      till January, 1256. But an army had been sent long in advance under “one of
      his Barons,” Kitubuka Noyan, and in 1253 it was already actively engaged
      in besieging the Ismailite fortresses. In 1255, during the progress of the
      war, <span class="smcap">Ala’uddin Mahomed</span>, the reigning Prince of the Assassins (mentioned
      by Polo as Alaodin), was murdered at the instigation of his son Ruknuddin
      Khurshah, who succeeded to the authority. A year later (November, 1256)
      Ruknuddin surrendered to Hulaku. [Bretschneider (<cite>Med. Res.</cite> II. p. 109)
      says that Alamút was taken by Hulaku, 20th December, 1256.—H.&nbsp;C.] The
      fortresses given up, all well furnished with provisions and artillery
      engines, were 100 in number. Two of them, however, Lembeser and Girdkuh,
      refused to surrender. The former fell after a year; the latter is stated
      to have held out for <em>twenty years</em>—actually, as it would seem, about
      fourteen, or till December, 1270. Ruknuddin was well treated by Hulaku, and
      despatched to the Court of the Kaan. The accounts of his death differ, but
      that most commonly alleged, according to Rashiduddin, is that Mangku Kaan
      was irritated at hearing of his approach, asking why his post-horses should
      be fagged to no purpose, and sent executioners to put Ruknuddin to death on
      the road. Alamút had been surrendered without any substantial resistance.
      Some survivors of the sect got hold of it again in 1275–1276, and held out
      for a time. The dominion was extinguished, but the sect remained, though
      scattered indeed and obscure. A very strange case that came before Sir
      Joseph Arnould in the High Court at Bombay in 1866 threw much new light on
      the survival of the Ismailis.</p>

    <p>Some centuries ago a <em>Dai</em> or Missionary of the Ismailis, named Sadruddín,
      made converts from the Hindu trading classes in Upper Sind. Under the name
      of <em>Khojas</em> the sect multiplied considerably in Sind, Kach’h, and Guzerat,
      whence they spread to Bombay and to Zanzibar. Their numbers in Western
      India are now probably not less than 50,000 to 60,000. Their doctrine, or
      at least the books which they revere, appear to embrace a strange jumble of
      Hindu notions with Mahomedan practices and Shiah mysticism, but the main
      characteristic endures of deep reverence, if not worship, of the person of
      their hereditary Imám. To his presence, when he resided in Persia, numbers
      of pilgrims used to betake themselves, and large remittances of what we may
      call <em>Ismail’s Pence</em> were made to him. Abul Hassan, the last Imám but one
      of admitted lineal descent from the later Shaikhs of Alamút, and claiming
      (as they did) descent from the Imám Ismail and his great ancestor ’Ali Abu
      Tálib, had considerable estates at Meheláti, between Kúm and Hamadán, and
      at one time held the Government of Kermán. His son and successor, Shah
      Khalilullah, was killed in a brawl at Yezd in 1818. Fatteh ’Ali Sháh,
      fearing Ismailite vengeance, caused the homicide to be severely punished,
      and conferred gifts and honours on the young Imám, Agha Khan, including
      the hand of one of his own daughters. In 1840 Agha Khan, who <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>had raised a
      revolt at Kermán, had to escape from Persia. He took refuge in Sind, and
      eventually rendered good service both to General Nott at Kandahár and to
      Sir C. Napier in Sind, for which he receives a pension from our Government.</p>

    <p>For many years this genuine Heir and successor of the <i lang="fr">Viex de la
      Montaingne</i> has had his headquarters at Bombay, where he devotes, or for a
      long time did devote, the large income that he receives from the faithful
      to the maintenance of a racing stable, being the chief patron and promoter
      of the Bombay Turf!</p>

    <p>A schism among the Khojas, owing apparently to the desire of part of the
      well-to-do Bombay community to sever themselves from the peculiarities of
      the sect and to set up as respectable Sunnis, led in 1866 to an action
      in the High Court, the object of which was to exclude Agha Khan from all
      rights over the Khojas, and to transfer the property of the community to
      the charge of Orthodox Mahomedans. To the elaborate addresses of Mr. Howard
      and Sir Joseph Arnould, on this most singular process before an English
      Court, I owe the preceding particulars. The judgment was entirely in favour
      of the Old Man of the Mountain.</p>

      croire à cele simple gent qui li est entour que il est un grant prophete.”</div>

    <p>[Sir Bartle Frere writes of Agha Khan in 1875: “Like his ancestor, the Old
      One of Marco Polo’s time, he keeps his court in grand and noble style. His
      sons, popularly known as ‘The Persian Princes,’ are active sportsmen, and
      age has not dulled the Agha’s enjoyment of horse-racing. Some of the best
      blood of Arabia is always to be found in his stables. He spares no expense
      on his racers, and no prejudice of religion or race prevents his availing
      himself of the science and skill of an English trainer or jockey when the
      races come round. If tidings of war or threatened <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>disturbance should arise
      from Central Asia or Persia, the Agha is always one of the first to hear of
      it, and seldom fails to pay a visit to the Governor or to some old friend
      high in office to hear the news and offer the services of a tried sword
      and an experienced leader to the Government which has so long secured him
      a quiet refuge for his old age.” Agha Khan died in April, 1881, at the age
      of 81. He was succeeded by his son Agha Ali Sháh, one of the members of the
      Legislative Council. (See <cite>The Homeward Mail, Overland Times of India</cite>, of
      14th April, 1881.)]</p>

    <p>The <em>Bohras</em> of Western India are identified with the Imámí-Ismáilís in
      some books, and were so spoken of in the first edition of this work. This
      is, however, an error, originally due, it would seem, to Sir John Malcolm.
      The nature of their doctrine, indeed, seems to be very much alike, and the
      Bohras, like the Ismáilís, attach a divine character to their <em>Mullah</em> or
      chief pontiff, and make a pilgrimage to his presence once in life. But the
      <em>persons</em> so reverenced are quite different; and the Bohras recognise all
      the 12 Imáms of ordinary Shiahs. Their first appearance in India was early,
      the date which they assign being <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span> 532 (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1137–1138). Their chief
      seat was in Yemen, from which a large emigration to India took place on its
      conquest by the Turks in 1538. Ibn Batuta seems to have met with Bohras at
      Gandár, near Baroch, in 1342. (<cite>Voyages</cite>, IV. 58.)</p>

    <p>A Chinese account of the expedition of Hulaku will be found in Rémusat’s
      <cite>Nouveaux Mélanges</cite> (I.), and in Pauthier’s Introduction. (<cite>Q. R.</cite> 115–219,
      esp. 213; <cite>Ilch.</cite> vol. i.; <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite> VI. 842 <i>seqq.</i>) [A new and complete
      translation has been given by Dr. E. Bretschneider, <cite>Med. Res.</cite> I. 112
      <i>seqq.</i>—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>There is some account of the rock of Alamút and its exceedingly slender
      traces of occupancy, by Colonel Monteith, in <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> III. 15, and
      again by Sir Justin Sheil in vol. viii. p. 431. There does not seem to be
      any specific authority for assigning the Paradise of the Shaikh to Alamút;
      and it is at least worthy of note that another of the castles of the
      Muláhidah, destroyed by Hulaku, was called <em>Firdús</em>, <i>i.e.</i> Paradise. In any
      case, I see no reason to suppose that Polo visited Alamút, which would have
      been quite out of the road that he is following.</p>

    <p>It is possible that “the Castle,” to which he alludes at the beginning of
      next chapter, and which set him off upon this digression, was <em>Girdkuh</em>.<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
      It has not, as far as I know, been identified by modern travellers, but it
      stood within 10 or 12 miles of Damghan (to the west or north-west). It is
      probably the <em>Tigado</em> of Hayton, of which he thus speaks: “The Assassins
      had an impregnable castle called Tigado, which was furnished with all
      necessaries, and was so strong that it had no fear of attack on any side.
      Howbeit, Haloön commanded a certain captain of his that he should take
      10,000 Tartars who had been left in garrison in Persia, and with them lay
      siege to the said castle, and not leave it till he had taken it. Wherefore
      the said Tartars continued besieging it for seven whole years, winter and
      summer, without being able to take it. At last the Assassins surrendered,
      from sheer want of clothing, but not of victuals or other necessaries.”
      So Ramusio; other copies read “27 years.” In any case it corroborates the
      fact that Girdkuh was said to have held out for an extraordinary length of
      time. If Rashiduddin is right in naming 1270 as the date of surrender, this
      would be quite a recent event when the Polo party passed, and draw special
      attention to the spot. (<cite>J. As.</cite> sér. IV. tom. xiii. 48; <cite>Ilch.</cite> I. 93,
      104, 274; <cite>Q. R.</cite> p. 278; <cite>Ritter</cite>, VIII. 336.) A note which I have from
      <cite>Djihan Numa</cite> (I. 259) connects Girdkuh with a district called <cite>Chinar</cite>.
      This may be a clue to the term <cite>Arbre Sec</cite>; but there are difficulties.</p>

    and pretty hill-sides producing excellent grass pasture, and abundance of
    fruits, and all other products. Armies are glad to take up their quarters
    here on account of the plenty that exists. This kind of country extends for
    six days’ journey, with a goodly number of towns and villages, in which the
    people are worshippers of Mahommet. Sometimes also you meet with a tract
    of desert extending for 50 or 60 miles, or somewhat less, and in these
    deserts you find no water, but have to carry it along with you. The beasts
    do without drink until you have got across the desert tract and come to
    watering places.</p>

  <p>So after travelling for six days as I have told you, you come to a city
    called <span class="smcap">Sapurgan</span>. It has great plenty of everything, but especially of the
    very best melons in the world. They preserve them by paring them round and

      Pauthier’s text has “<i lang="fr">Et quant l’en a chevauchié</i> les vi cités, <i lang="fr">si treuve
      l’en une cité qui a nom Sapurgan</i>,” and to this that editor adheres. But I
      suspect that <i lang="fr">cités</i> is a mere lapsus for <i lang="fr">journées</i>, as in the reading in
      one of his three MSS. What could be meant by “<i lang="fr">chevauchier les</i> vi <i lang="fr">cités</i>”?</p>

    <p>Whether the true route be, as I suppose, by Nishapúr and Meshid, or, as
      Khanikoff supposes, by Herat and Badghis, it is strange that no one of
      those famous cities is mentioned. And we feel constrained to assume that
      something has been misunderstood in the dictation, or has dropt out of it.
      As a <em>probable</em> conjecture I should apply the six days to the extent of
      pleasing country described in the first lines of the chapter, and identify
      it with the tract between Sabzawur and the cessation of fertile country
      beyond Meshid. The distance would agree well, and a comparison with Fraser
      or Ferrier will show that even now the description, allowing for the
      compression of an old recollection, would be well founded; <i>e.g.</i> on the
      first march beyond Nishapúr: “Fine villages, with plentiful gardens full
      of trees, that bear fruit of the highest flavour, may be seen all along
      the foot of the hills, and in the little recesses formed by the ravines
      whence issues the water that irrigates them. It was a rich and pleasing
      scene, and out of question by far the most populous and cultivated tract
      that I had seen in Persia.... Next morning we quitted Derrood ... by a very
      indifferent but interesting road, the glen being finely wooded with walnut,
      mulberry, poplar, and willow-trees, and fruit-tree gardens rising one above
      the other upon the mountain-side, watered by little rills.... These gardens
      extended for several miles up the glen; beyond them the bank of the stream
      continued to be fringed with white sycamore, willow, ash, mulberry, poplar,
      and woods that love a moist situation,” and so on, describing a style of
      scenery not common in Persia, and expressing diffusely (as it seems to me)
      the same picture as Polo’s two lines. In the valley of Nishapúr, again (we
      quote Arthur Conolly): “‘This is Persia!’ was the vain exclamation of those
      who were alive to the beauty of the scene; ‘this is Persia!’ <em>Bah! Bah!</em>
      What grass, what grain, what water! <em>Bah! Bah!</em></p>

    <p>With reference to the dried melons of Shibrgán, Quatremère cites a history
      of Herat, which speaks of them almost in Polo’s words. Ibn Batuta gives a
      like account of the melons of Khárizm: “The surprising thing about these
      melons is the way the people have of slicing them, drying them in the sun,
      and then packing them in baskets, just as Malaga figs are treated in our
      part of the world. In this state they are sent to the remotest parts of
      India and China. There is no dried fruit so delicious, and all the while I
      lived at Delhi, when the travelling dealers came in, I never missed sending
      for these dried strips of melon.” (<cite>Q. R.</cite> 169; <cite>I. B.</cite> III. 15.) Here, in
      the 14th century, we seem to recognise the Afghan dealers arriving in the
      cities of Hindustan with their annual camel-loads of dried fruits, just as
      we have seen them in our own day.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Balc</span> is a noble city and a great, though it was much greater in former
    days. But the Tartars and other nations have greatly ravaged and destroyed
    it. There were formerly many fine palaces and buildings of marble, and the
    ruins of them still remain. The people of the city tell that it was here
    that Alexander took to wife the daughter of Darius.</p>

  <p>Here, you should be told, is the end of the empire of the Tartar Lord of

  <p>When you have quitted the city of which I have been speaking, you ride some
    12 days between north-east and east, without finding any human habitation,
    for the people have all taken refuge in fastnesses among the mountains, on

      Though the city had yielded without resistance, the whole population
      was marched by companies into the plain, on the usual Mongol pretext of
      counting them, and then brutally massacred. The city and its gardens were
      fired, and all buildings capable of defence were levelled. The province
      long continued to be harried by the Chaghataian inroads. Ibn Batuta, sixty
      years after Marco’s visit, describes the city as still in ruins, and as
      uninhabited: “The remains of its mosques and colleges,” he says, “are still
      to be seen, and the painted walls traced with azure.” It is no doubt the
      Vaeq (<i>Valq</i>) of Clavijo, “very large, and surrounded by a broad earthen
      wall, thirty paces across, but breached in many parts.” He describes a
      large portion of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>the area within as sown with cotton. The account of its
      modern state in Burnes and Ferrier is much the same as Ibn Batuta’s, except
      that they found some population; two separate towns within the walls
      according to the latter. Burnes estimates the circuit of the ruins at 20
      miles. The bulk of the population has been moved since 1858 to Takhtapul, 8
      miles east of Balkh, where the Afghan Government is placed.</p>

      former edition I suggested <em>Juzgána</em>, a name which till our author’s time
      was applied to a part of the adjoining territory, though not to that
      traversed in quitting Balkh for the east. Sir H. Rawlinson is inclined
      to refer the name to <em>Dehgán</em>, or “villager,” a term applied in Bactria,
      and in Kabul, to Tajik peasantry<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. I may also refer to certain passages
      in Baber’s “Memoirs,” in which he speaks of a place, and apparently a
      district, called <em>Dehánah</em>, which seems from the context to have lain in
      the vicinity of the Ghori, or Aksarai River. There is still a village in
      the Ghori territory, called <em>Dehánah</em>. Though this is worth mentioning,
      where the true solution is so uncertain, I acknowledge the difficulty of
      applying it. I may add also that Baber calls the River of Ghori or Aksarai,
      the <em>Dogh</em>-ábah. (<cite>Sprenger, P. und R. Routen</cite>, p. 39 and Map; <cite>Anderson</cite>

      necessarily to have been here followed from Balkh towards Taican, as barren
      and dreary, he adds that the ruins of <em>aqueducts</em> and houses proved that
      the land had at one time been peopled, though now destitute of water, and
      consequently of inhabitants. The country would seem to have reverted at the
      time of Burnes’ journey, from like causes, nearly to the state in which
      Marco found it after the Mongol devastations.</p>

    <p><em>Lions</em> seem to mean here the real king of beasts, and not tigers, as
      hereafter in the book. Tigers, though found on the S. and W. shores of
      the Caspian, do not seem to exist in the Oxus valley. On the other hand,
      Rashiduddin tells us that, when Hulaku was reviewing his army after the
      passage of the river, several lions were started, and two were killed. The
      lions are also mentioned by Sidi ’Ali, the Turkish Admiral, further down
      the valley towards Hazárasp: “We were obliged to fight with the lions day
      and night, and no man dared to go alone for water.” Moorcroft says of the
      plain between Kunduz and the Oxus: “Deer, foxes, wolves, hogs, and <em>lions</em>
      are numerous, the latter resembling those in the vicinity of Hariana” (in
      Upper India). Wood also mentions lions in Kuláb, and at Kila’chap on the
      Oxus. Q. Curtius tells how Alexander killed a great lion in the country
      north of the Oxus towards Samarkand. [A similar story is told of Timur in
      <cite>The Mulfuzat Timūry</cite>, translated by Major Charles Stewart, 1830 (p. 69):
      “During the march ‘(near Balkh)’ two lions made their appearance, one of
      them a male, the other a female. I (Timur) resolved to kill them myself,
      and having shot them both with arrows, I considered this circumstance as
      a lucky omen.”—H.&nbsp;C.] (<cite>Burnes</cite>, II. 200; <cite>Q. R.</cite> 155; <cite>Ilch.</cite> I. 90; <cite>J.

    and the mountains that you see towards the south are all composed of salt.
    People from all the countries round, to some thirty days’ journey, come to
    fetch this salt, which is the best in the world, and is so hard that it can
    only be broken with iron picks. ’Tis in such abundance that it would supply
    the whole world to the end of time. [Other mountains there grow almonds and
    pistachioes, which are exceedingly cheap.]<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVIII12" href="#Note_XXVIII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>When you leave this town and ride three days further between north-east and
    east, you meet with many fine tracts full of vines and other fruits, and
    with a goodly number of habitations, and everything to be had very cheap.
    The people are worshippers of Mahommet, and are an evil and a murderous
    generation, whose great delight is in the wine shop; for they have good
    wine (albeit it be boiled), and are great topers; in truth, they are
    constantly getting drunk. They wear nothing on the head but a cord some
    ten palms long twisted round it. They are excellent huntsmen, and take a
    great deal of game; in fact they wear nothing but the skins of the beasts
    they have taken in the chase, for they make of them both coats and shoes.
    Indeed, all of them are acquainted with the art of dressing skins for these
    purposes.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVIII13" href="#Note_XXVIII13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>When you have ridden those three days, you find a town called <span class="smcap">Casem</span>,<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVIII14" href="#Note_XXVIII14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a>
    which is subject to a count. His other towns and villages are on the
    hills, but through this <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>town there flows a river of some size. There are a
    great many porcupines hereabouts, and very large ones too. When hunted with
    dogs, several of them will get together and huddle close, shooting their
    quills at the dogs, which get many a serious wound thereby.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVIII15" href="#Note_XXVIII15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>This town of Casem is at the head of a very great province, which is also
    called Casem. The people have a peculiar language. The peasants who keep
    cattle abide in the mountains, and have their dwellings in caves, which
    form fine and spacious houses for them, and are made with ease, as the
    hills are composed of earth.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVIII16" href="#Note_XXVIII16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <p>After leaving the town of Casem, you ride for three days without finding a
    single habitation, or anything to eat or drink, so that you have to carry
    with you everything that you require. At the end of those three days you
    reach a province called Badashan, about which we shall now tell you.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVIII17" href="#Note_XXVIII17" class="fnanchor">{7}</a></p>

      1.</a>—The <em>Taican</em> of Polo is the still existing <span class="smcap">Talikan</span> in the province
      of Kataghan or Kunduz, but it bears the former name (<em>Tháîḳán</em>) in the old
      Arab geographies. Both names are used by Baber, who says it lay in the
      <em>Ulugh Bágh</em>, or Great Garden, a name perhaps acquired by the Plains of
      Talikan in happier days, but illustrating what Polo says of the next three
      days’ march. The Castle of Talikan resisted Chinghiz for seven months,
      and met with the usual fate (1221). [In the Travels of Sidi Ali, son of
      Housaïn (<cite>Jour. Asiat.</cite>, October, 1826, p. 203), “Talikan, in the country
      of Badakhschan” is mentioned.—H.&nbsp;C.] Wood speaks of Talikan in 1838 as a
      poor place of some 300 or 400 houses, mere hovels; a recent account gives
      it 500 families. Market days are not usual in Upper India or Kabul, but are
      universal in Badakhshan and the Oxus provinces. The bazaars are only open
      on those days, and the people from the surrounding country then assemble to
      exchange goods, generally by barter. Wood chances to note: “A market was
      held at Talikan.... The thronged state of the roads leading into it soon
      apprised us that the day was no ordinary one.” (<cite>Abulf.</cite> in <cite>Büsching</cite>,
      V. 352; <cite>Sprenger</cite>, p. 50; <cite>P. de la Croix</cite>, I. 63; <cite>Baber</cite>, 38, 130;
      <cite>Burnes</cite>, III. 8; <cite>Wood</cite>, 156; <cite>Pandit Manphul’s Report</cite>.)</p>

    <p>The distance of Talikan from Balkh is about 170 miles, which gives very
      short marches, if twelve days be the correct reading. Ramusio has <em>two</em>
      days, which is certainly wrong. XII. is easily miswritten for VII., which
      would be a just number.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXVIII12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXVIII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—In our day, as I learn from Pandit Manphul, the mines of rock salt
      are at Ak Bulák, near the Lataband Pass, and at Darúná, near the Kokcha,
      and these supply the whole of Badakhshan, as well as Kunduz and Chitrál.
      These sites are due <em>east</em> of Talikan, and are in Badakhshan. But there is
      a mine at <em>Chál</em>, S.E. or S.S.E. of Talikan and within the same province.
      There are also mines of rock-salt near the famous “stone bridge” in Kuláb,
      north of the Oxus, and again on the south <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>of the Alaï steppe. (Papers by
      <cite>Manphul</cite> and by <cite>Faiz Baksh</cite>; also <cite>Notes</cite> by <cite>Feachenko</cite>.)</p>

    <p>Both pistachioes and wild almonds are mentioned by Pandit Manphul; and see
      <cite>Wood</cite> (p. 252) on the beauty and profusion of the latter.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXVIII13" href="#NoteAnchor_XXVIII13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Wood thinks that the Tajik inhabitants of Badakhshan and the
      adjoining districts are substantially of the same race as the Kafir tribes
      of Hindu Kúsh. At the time of Polo’s visit it would seem that their
      conversion to Islam was imperfect. They were probably in that transition
      state which obtains in our own day for some of the Hill Mahomedans
      adjoining the Kafirs on the south side of the mountains the reproachful
      title of <em>Nímchah Musulmán</em>, or Half-and-halfs. Thus they would seem to
      have retained sundry Kafir characteristics; among others that love of wine
      which is so strong among the Kafirs. The boiling of the wine is noted by
      Baber (a connoisseur) as the custom of Nijrao, adjoining, if not then
      included in, Kafir-land; and Elphinstone implies the continuance of the
      custom when he speaks of the Kafirs as having wine of <em>the consistence
      of jelly</em>, and very strong. The wine of <em>Kápishí</em>, the Greek Kapisa,
      immediately south of Hindu Kúsh, was famous as early as the time of the
      Hindu grammarian Pánini, say three centuries <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> The cord twisted round
      the head was probably also a relic of Kafir costume: “Few of the Kafirs
      cover the head, and when they do, it is with a narrow band or fillet of
      goat’s hair ... about a yard or a yard and a half in length, wound round
      the head.” This style of head-dress seems to be very ancient in India, and
      in the Sanchi sculptures is that of the supposed Dasyas. Something very
      similar, <i>i.e.</i> a scanty turban cloth twisted into a mere cord, and wound two
      or three times round the head, is often seen in the Panjab to this day.</p>

    <p>The <em>Postín</em> or sheepskin coat is almost universal on both sides of the
      Hindu Kúsh; and Wood notes: “The shoes in use resemble half-boots, made of
      goatskin, and mostly of home manufacture.” (<cite>Baber</cite>, 145; <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite>

      4.</a>—Marsden was right in identifying <em>Scassem</em> or <em>Casem</em> with the
      <em>Kechem</em> of D’Anville’s Map, but wrong in confounding the latter with
      the <em>Kishmabad</em> of Elphinstone—properly, I believe, <em>Kishnabad</em>—in the
      Anderab Valley. Kashm, or Keshm, found its way into maps through Pétis de
      la Croix, from whom probably D’Anville adopted it; but as it was ignored
      by Elphinstone (or by Macartney, who constructed his map), and by Burnes,
      it dropped out of our geography. Indeed, Wood does not notice it except
      as giving name to a high hill called the Hill of Kishm, and the position
      even of that he omits to indicate. The frequent mention of Kishm in the
      histories of Timur and Humayun (<i>e.g.</i> <cite>P. de la Croix</cite>, I. 167; <cite>N. et
      E.</cite> XIV. 223, 491; <cite>Erskine’s Baber and Humayun</cite>, II. 330, 355, etc.)
      had enabled me to determine its position within tolerably narrow limits;
      but desiring to fix it definitely, application was made through Colonel
      Maclagan to Pandit Manphul, C.S.I., a very intelligent Hindu gentleman, who
      resided for some time in Badakhshan as agent of the Panjab Government, and
      from him arrived a special note and sketch, and afterwards a MS. copy of a
      Report,<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which set the position of Kishm at rest.</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Kishm</span> is the <em>Kilissemo</em>, <i>i.e.</i> Karisma or Krishma, of Hiuen Tsang; and Sir
      H. Rawlinson has identified the Hill of Kishm with the Mount Kharesem of
      the Zend-Avesta, on which Jamshid placed the most sacred of all the fires.
      It is now a small town or large village on the right bank of the Varsach
      river, a tributary of the Kokcha. It was in 1866 the seat of a district
      ruler under the Mír of Badakhshan, who was styled the Mír of Kishm, and is
      the modern counterpart of Marco’s <em>Quens</em> or Count. The modern caravan-road
      between Kunduz and Badakhshan does not pass through Kishm, which is left
      some five miles to the right, but through the town of Mashhad, which stands
      on the same river. Kishm is the warmest district of Badakhshan. Its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>fruits
      are abundant, and ripen a month earlier than those at Faizabad, the capital
      of that country. The Varsach or Mashhad river is Marco’s “<i lang="it">Flum auques
      grant</i>.” Wood (247) calls it “the largest stream we had yet forded in Badakhshan.”</p>

    <p>It is very notable that in Ramusio, in Pipino, and in one passage of the
      G. Text, the name is written <em>Scasem</em>, which has led some to suppose the
      <em>Ish-Káshm</em> of Wood to be meant. That place is much too far east—in fact,
      beyond the city which forms the subject of the next chapter. The apparent
      hesitation, however, between the forms <em>Casem</em> and <em>Scasem</em> suggests that
      the Kishm of our note may formerly have been termed S’kăshm or Ish-Kăshm,
      a form frequent in the Oxus Valley, <i>e.g.</i> <em>Ish-Kimish, Ish-Káshm, Ishtrakh,
      Ishpingao</em>. General Cunningham judiciously suggests (<cite>Ladak</cite>, 34) that this
      form is merely a vocal corruption of the initial <em>S</em> before a consonant, a
      combination which always troubles the Musulman in India, and converts every
      Mr. Smith or Mr. Sparks into Ismit or Ispak Sahib.</p>

    <p>[There does not seem to me any difficulty about this note: “Shibarkhan
      (Afghan Turkistan), Balkh, Kunduz, Khanabad, Talikan, Kishm, Badakhshan.” I
      am tempted to look for Dogana at Khanabad.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      5.</a>—The belief that the porcupine <em>projected</em> its quills at its
      assailants was an ancient and persistent one—“<i lang="la">cum intendit cutem
      missiles</i>,” says Pliny (VIII. 35, and see also <cite>Aelian. de Nat. An.</cite> I.
      31), and is held by the Chinese as it was held by the ancients, but is
      universally rejected by modern zoologists. The huddling and coiling appears
      to be a true characteristic, for the porcupine always tries to shield its head.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXVIII16" href="#NoteAnchor_XXVIII16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—The description of Kishm as a “very great” province is an example
      of a bad habit of Marco’s, which recurs in the next chapter. What he
      says of the cave-dwellings may be illustrated by Burnes’s account of the
      excavations at Bamian, in a neighbouring district. These “still form the
      residence of the greater part of the population.... The hills at Bamian
      are formed of indurated clay and pebbles, which renders this excavation a
      matter of little difficulty.” Similar occupied excavations are noticed by
      Moorcroft at Heibak and other places towards Khulm.</p>

    <p>Curiously, Pandit Manphul says of the districts about the Kokcha: “Both
      their hills and plains are productive, the former <em>being mostly composed of
      earth, having very little of rocky substance</em>.”</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXVIII17" href="#NoteAnchor_XXVIII17" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.</a>—The capital of Badakhshan is now Faizabad, on the right bank of
      the Kokcha, founded, according to Manphul, by Yarbeg, the first Mír of
      the present dynasty. When this family was displaced for a time, by Murad
      Beg of Kunduz, about 1829, the place was abandoned for years, but is now
      re-occupied. The ancient capital of Badakhshan stood in the Dasht (or
      Plain) of Bahárak, one of the most extensive pieces of level in Badakhshan,
      in which the rivers Vardoj, Zardeo, and Sarghalan unite with the Kokcha,
      and was apparently termed <em>Jaúzgún</em>. This was probably the city called
      Badakhshan by our traveller.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> As far as I can estimate, by the help
      of Wood and the map I have compiled, this will be from 100 to 110 miles
      distant from Talikan, and will therefore suit fairly with the six marches
      that Marco lays down.</p>

    <p>Wood, in 1838, found the whole country between Talikan and Faizabad nearly
      as depopulated as Marco found that between Kishm and Badakhshan. The
      modern depopulation was due—in part, at least—to the recent oppressions
      and <em>razzias</em> of the Uzbeks of Kunduz. On their decline, between 1840 and
      1850, the family of the native Mírs was reinstated, and these now rule at
      Faizabad, under an acknowledgment, since 1859, of Afghan supremacy.</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XXIX1"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER XXIX</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Province of Badashan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Badashan</span> is a Province inhabited by people who worship Mahommet, and have
    a peculiar language. It forms a very great kingdom, and the royalty is
    hereditary. All those of the royal blood are descended from King Alexander
    and the daughter of King Darius, who was Lord of the vast Empire of Persia.
    And all these kings call themselves in the Saracen tongue <span class="smcap">Zulcarniain</span>,
    which is as much as to say <em>Alexander</em>; and this out of regard for
    Alexander the Great.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX11" href="#Note_XXIX11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>It is in this province that those fine and valuable gems the Balas Rubies
    are found. They are got in certain rocks among the mountains, and in the
    search for them the people dig great caves underground, just as is done by
    miners for silver. There is but one special mountain that produces them,
    and it is called <span class="smcap">Syghinan</span>. The stones are dug on the king’s account, and
    no one else dares dig in that mountain on pain of forfeiture of life as
    well as goods; nor may any one carry the stones out of the kingdom. But the
    king amasses them all, and sends them to other kings when he has tribute to
    render, or when he desires to offer a friendly present; and such only as he
    pleases he causes to be sold. Thus he acts in order to keep the Balas at a
    high value; for if he were to allow everybody to dig, they would extract
    so many that the world would be glutted with them, and they would cease to
    bear any value. Hence it is that he allows so few to be taken out, and is
    so strict in the matter.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX12" href="#Note_XXIX12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>There is also in the same country another mountain, in which azure is
    found; ’tis the finest in the world, and is got in a vein like silver.
    There are also other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>mountains which contain a great amount of silver ore,
    so that the country is a very rich one; but it is also (it must be said) a
    very cold one.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX13" href="#Note_XXIX13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> It produces numbers of excellent horses, remarkable
    for their speed. They are not shod at all, although constantly used in
    mountainous country, and on very bad roads. [They go at a great pace even
    down steep descents, where other horses neither would nor could do the
    like. And Messer Marco was told that not long ago they possessed in that
    province a breed of horses from the strain of Alexander’s horse Bucephalus,
    all of which had from their birth a particular mark on the forehead.
    This breed was entirely in the hands of an uncle of the king’s; and in
    consequence of his refusing to let the king have any of them, the latter
    put him to death. The widow then, in despite, destroyed the whole breed,
    and it is now extinct.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX14" href="#Note_XXIX14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a>]</p>

  <p>The mountains of this country also supply Saker falcons of excellent
    flight, and plenty of Lanners likewise. Beasts and birds for the chase
    there are in great abundance. Good wheat is grown, and also barley without
    husk. They have no olive oil, but make oil from sesamé, and also from
    walnuts.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX15" href="#Note_XXIX15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>[In the mountains there are vast numbers of sheep—400, 500, or 600 in a
    single flock, and all of them wild; and though many of them are taken, they
    never seem to get aught the scarcer.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX16" href="#Note_XXIX16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <p>Those mountains are so lofty that ’tis a hard day’s work, from morning till
    evening, to get to the top of them. On getting up, you find an extensive
    plain, with great abundance of grass and trees, and copious springs of pure
    water running down through rocks and ravines. In those brooks are found
    trout and many other fish of dainty kinds; and the air in those regions
    is so pure, and residence there so healthful, that when the men who dwell
    below in the towns, and in the valleys and plains, find <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>themselves attacked
    by any kind of fever or other ailment that may hap, they lose no time in
    going to the hills; and after abiding there two or three days, they quite
    recover their health through the excellence of that air. And Messer Marco
    said he had proved this by experience: for when in those parts he had been
    ill for about a year, but as soon as he was advised to visit that mountain,
    he did so and got well at once.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX17" href="#Note_XXIX17" class="fnanchor">{7}</a>]</p>

    <div class="caption">Ancient Silver Patera of debased Greek art, formerly in

  </div>

  <p>In this kingdom there are many strait and perilous passes, so difficult to
    force that the people have no fear of invasion. Their towns and villages
    also are on lofty hills, and in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>very strong positions.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX18" href="#Note_XXIX18" class="fnanchor">{8}</a> They are
    excellent archers, and much given to the chase; indeed, most of them are
    dependent for clothing on the skins of beasts, for stuffs are very dear
    among them. The great ladies, however, are arrayed in stuffs, and I will
    tell you the style of their dress! They all wear drawers made of cotton
    cloth, and into the making of these some will put 60, 80, or even 100 ells
    of stuff. This they do to make themselves look large in the hips, for the
    men of those parts think that to be a great beauty in a woman.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIX19" href="#Note_XXIX19" class="fnanchor">{9}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXIX11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIX11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—“The population of Badakhshan Proper is composed of Tajiks,
      Turks, and Arabs, who are all Sunnis, following the orthodox doctrines
      of the Mahomedan law, and speak Persian and Turki, whilst the people of
      the more mountainous tracts are Tajiks of the Shiá creed, having separate
      provincial dialects or languages of their own, the inhabitants of the
      principal places combining therewith a knowledge of Persian. Thus, the
      <em>Shighnáni</em> [sometimes called <em>Shighni</em>] is spoken in Shignán and Roshán,
      the <em>Ishkáshami</em> in Ishkásham, the <em>Wakhi</em> in Wakhán, the <em>Sanglichì</em>
      in Sanglich and Zebák, and the <em>Minjáni</em> in Minján. All these dialects
      materially differ from each other.” (<cite>Pand. Manphul.</cite>) It may be considered
      almost certain that Badakhshan Proper also had a peculiar dialect in Polo’s
      time. Mr. Shaw speaks of the strong resemblance to <em>Kashmírís</em> of the
      Badakhshán people whom he had seen.</p>

    <p>The Legend of the Alexandrian pedigree of the Kings of Badakhshan is
      spoken of by Baber, and by earlier Eastern authors. This pedigree is, or
      was, claimed also by the chiefs of Karátegín, Darwáz, Roshán, Shighnán,
      Wakhán, Chitrál, Gilgít, Swát, and Khapolor in Bálti. Some samples of
      those genealogies may be seen in that strange document called “Gardiner’s
      Travels.”</p>

    <p>In Badakhshan Proper the story seems now to have died out. Indeed, though
      Wood mentions one of the modern family of Mírs as vaunting this descent,
      these are in fact <em>Sáhibzádahs</em> of Samarkand, who were invited to the
      country about the middle of the 17th century, and were in no way connected
      with the old kings.</p>

    <p>The traditional claims to Alexandrian descent were probably due to a
      genuine memory of the Græco-Bactrian kingdom, and might have had an origin
      analogous to the Sultan’s claim to be “Caesar of Rome”; for the real
      ancestry of the oldest dynasties on the Oxus was to be sought rather among
      the Tochari and Ephthalites than among the Greeks whom they superseded.</p>

    <p>The cut on <a href="#Page_159">p. 159</a> presents an interesting memorial of the real relation of
      Bactria to Greece, as well as of the pretence of the Badakhshan princes to
      Grecian descent. This silver patera was sold by the family of the Mírs,
      when captives, to the Minister of the Uzbek chief of Kunduz, and by him to
      Dr. Percival Lord in 1838. It is now in the India Museum. On the bottom is
      punched a word or two in Pehlvi, and there is also a word incised in Syriac
      or Uighúr. It is curious that a <em>pair</em> of paterae were acquired by Dr. Lord
      under the circumstances stated. The other, similar in material and form,
      but apparently somewhat larger, is distinctly Sassanian, representing a
      king spearing a lion.</p>

    <p><em>Zu-’lḳarnain</em>, “the Two-Horned,” is an Arabic epithet of Alexander, with
      which legends have been connected, but which probably arose from the horned
      portraits on his coins. [Capus, <i>l.c.</i> p. 121, says, “Iskandr Zoulcarneïn
      or Alexander <i lang="fr">le Cornu</i>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>horns being the emblem of strength.”—H.&nbsp;C.] The
      term appears in Chaucer (<cite>Troil. and Cress.</cite> III. 931) in the sense of <i lang="fr">non
      plus</i>:—</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">And it is said to have still colloquial existence in that sense in some
      corners of England. This use is said to have arisen from the Arabic
      application of the term (<em>Bicorne</em>) to the 47th Proposition of Euclid.

      of the several forms in the G. Text which comes nearest to the correct
      name, viz. <em>Badascian</em>. But <em>Balacian</em> also appears both in that and in
      Pauthier’s text. This represents <em>Balakhshán</em>, a form also sometimes used
      in the East. Hayton has <em>Balaxcen</em>, Clavijo <em>Balaxia</em>, the Catalan Map
      <em>Baldassia</em>. From the form <em>Balakhsh</em> the Balas Ruby got its name. As Ibn
      Batuta says: “The Mountains of Badakhshan have given their name to the
      Badakhshi Ruby, vulgarly called <em>Al Balaksh</em>.” Albertus Magnus says the
      <em>Balagius</em> is the female of the Carbuncle or Ruby Proper, “and some say it
      is his house, and hath thereby got the name, quasi <em>Palatium</em> Carbunculi!”
      The Balais or Balas Ruby is, like the Spinel, a kind inferior to the real
      Ruby of Ava. The author of the <cite>Masálak al Absár</cite> says the finest Balas
      ever seen in the Arab countries was one presented to Malek ’Adil Ketboga,
      at Damascus; it was of a triangular form and weighed 50 drachms. The prices
      of <em>Balasci</em> in Europe in that age may be found in Pegolotti, but the
      needful problems are hard to solve.</p>

    <p>[“The Mohammedan authors of the Mongol period mention Badakhshan several
      times in connection with the political and military events of that period.
      Guchluk, the ‘gurkhan of Karakhitai,’ was slain in Badakhshan in 1218
      (<cite>d’Ohsson</cite>, I. 272). In 1221, the Mongols invaded the country (<i>l.c.</i> I.
      272). On the same page, d’Ohsson translates a short account of Badakhshan
      by Yakut (✛1229), stating that this mountainous country is famed for its
      precious stones, and especially rubies, called <em>Balakhsh</em>.” (Bretschneider,
      <cite>Med. Res.</cite> II. p. 66.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The account of the royal monopoly in working the mines, etc., has continued
      accurate down to our own day. When Murad Beg of Kunduz conquered Badakhshan
      some forty years ago, in disgust at the small produce of the mines, he
      abandoned working them, and sold nearly all the population of the place
      into slavery! They continue still unworked, unless clandestinely. In 1866
      the reigning Mír had one of them opened at the request of Pandit Manphul,
      but without much result.</p>

    <p>The locality of the mines is on the right bank of the Oxus, in the district
      of Ish Káshm and on the borders of <span class="smcap">Shignan</span>, the <em>Syghinan</em> of the text.
      (<cite>P. Manph.; Wood</cite>, 206; <cite>N. Ann. des. V.</cite> xxvi. 300.)</p>

    <p>[The ruby mines are really in the Gháran country, which extends along both
      banks <span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>of the Oxus. Barshar is one of the deserted villages; the boundary
      between Gháran and Shignán is the Kuguz Parin (in Shighai dialect means
      “holes in the rock”); the Persian equivalent is “Rafak-i-Somakh.” (Cf.
      Captain Trotter, <cite>Forsyth’s Mission</cite>, p. 277.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXIX13" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIX13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      3.</a>—The mines of <em>Lájwurd</em> (whence <em>l’Azur</em> and <em>Lazuli</em>) have been,
      like the Ruby mines, celebrated for ages. They lie in the Upper Valley
      of the Kokcha, called Korán, within the Tract called <em>Yamgán</em>, of which
      the popular etymology is <em>Hamah-Kán</em>, or “All-Mines,” and were visited
      by Wood in 1838. The produce now is said to be of very inferior quality,
      and in quantity from 30 to 60 <em>poods</em> (36 lbs each) annually. The best
      quality sells at Bokhara at 30 to 60 tillas, or 12<i>l.</i> to 24<i>l.</i> the
      pood (<em>Manphul</em>). Surely it is ominous when a British agent writing of
      Badakhshan products finds it natural to express weights in Russian poods!</p>

    <p>The Yamgán Tract also contains mines of iron, lead, alum, salammoniac,
      sulphur, ochre, and copper. The last are not worked. But I do not learn of
      any silver mines nearer than those of Paryán in the Valley of Panjshir,
      south of the crest of the Hindu-Kúsh, much worked in the early Middle Ages.
      (See <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 595.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXIX14" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIX14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—The Kataghan breed of horses from Badakhshan and Kunduz has still a
      high reputation. They do not often reach India, as the breed is a favourite
      one among the Afghan chiefs, and the horses are likely to be appropriated
      in transit. (<cite>Lumsden, Mission to Kandahar</cite>, p. 20.)</p>

    <p>[The Kirghiz between the Yangi Hissar River and Sirikol are the only
      people using the horse generally in the plough, oxen being employed in the
      plains, and yaks in Sirikol. (Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon, p. 222, <cite>Forsyth’s
      Mission</cite>.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>What Polo heard of the Bucephalid strain was perhaps but another form of a
      story told by the Chinese, many centuries earlier, when speaking of this
      same region. A certain cave was frequented by a wonderful stallion of
      supernatural origin. Hither the people yearly brought their mares, and a
      famous breed was derived from the foals. (<cite>Rém. N. Mél. As.</cite> I. 245.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXIX15" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIX15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—The huskless barley of the text is thus mentioned by Burnes in
      the vicinity of the Hindu-Kúsh: “They rear a barley in this elevated
      country which has no husk, and grows like wheat; but it is barley.” It is
      not properly <em>huskless</em>, but when ripe it bursts the husk and remains so
      loosely attached as to be dislodged from it by a slight shake. It is grown
      abundantly in Ladak and the adjoining Hill States. Moorcroft details six
      varieties of it cultivated there. The kind mentioned by Marco and Burnes
      is probably that named by Royle <em>Hordeum Ægiceras</em>, and which has been
      sent to England under the name of Tartarian Wheat, though it is a genuine
      barley. <em>Naked barley</em> is mentioned by Galen as grown in Cappadocia; and

      by Baber, and described by Mr. Blyth in his Monograph of Wild Sheep,
      under the name of <em>Ovis Vignei</em>. It is extensively diffused over all
      the ramifications of Hindu-Kúsh, and westward perhaps to the Persian
      Elburz. “It is gregarious,” says Wood, “congregating in herds of <em>several
      hundreds</em>.” In a later chapter Polo speaks of a wild sheep apparently
      different and greater. (See <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite>, X. 858 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>

      to doubt its genuine character. Marco’s recollection of the delight of
      convalescence in such a climate seems to lend an unusual enthusiasm and
      felicity to his description of the scenery. Such a region as he speaks of
      is probably the cool Plateau of Shewá, of which we are told as extending
      about 25 miles eastward from near Faizabad, and forming one of the finest
      pastures in Badakhshan. It contains a large lake called by the frequent
      name Sar-i-Kol. No European traveller in modern times (unless Mr. Gardner)
      has been on those glorious table-lands. Burnes says that at Kunduz both
      natives and foreigners spoke rapturously of the vales of Badakhshan, its
      rivulets, romantic scenes and glens, its fruits, flowers, and nightingales.
      Wood is reticent on scenery, naturally, since nearly all his journey was
      made in winter. When approaching Faizabad on his return from the Upper
      Oxus, however, he says: “On entering the beautiful lawn at the gorge of its
      valley I was enchanted at the quiet loveliness of the scene. Up to this
      time, from the day we left Talikan, we had been moving in snow; but now
      it had nearly vanished from the valley, and the fine sward was enamelled
      with crocuses, daffodils, and snowdrops.” (<cite>P. Manphul; Burnes</cite>, III. 176; <cite>Wood</cite>, 252.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXIX18" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIX18" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.</a>—Yet scarcely any country in the world has suffered so terribly and
      repeatedly from invasion. “Enduring decay probably commenced with the wars
      of Chinghiz, for many an instance in Eastern history shows the permanent
      effect of such devastations.... Century after century saw only progress in
      decay. Even to our own time the progress of depopulation and deterioration
      has continued.” In 1759, two of the Khojas of Kashgar, escaping from the
      dominant Chinese, took refuge in Badakhshan; one died of his wounds,
      the other was treacherously slain by Sultan Shah, who then ruled the
      country. The holy man is said in his dying moments to have invoked curses
      on Badakhshan, and prayed that it might be three times depopulated; a
      malediction which found ample accomplishment. The misery of the country
      came to a climax about 1830, when the Uzbek chief of Kunduz, Murad Beg
      Kataghan, swept away the bulk of the inhabitants, and set them down to die
      in the marshy plains of Kunduz. (<cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 542; <cite>Faiz Bakhsh</cite>, etc.)</p>

      of <em>Anthropometamorphosis</em> calls such a fashion, is no longer affected
      by the ladies of Badakhshan. But a friend in the Panjab observes that it
      still survives <em>there</em>. “There are ladies’ trousers here which might almost
      justify Marco’s very liberal estimate of the quantity of stuff required
      to make them;” and among the Afghan ladies, Dr. Bellew says, the silken
      trousers almost surpass crinoline in amplitude. It is curious to find the
      same characteristic attaching to female figures on coins of ancient kings
      of these regions, such as Agathocles and Pantaleon. (The last name is
      appropriate!)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Province of Pashai</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> must know that ten days’ journey to the south of Badashan there is a
    Province called <span class="smcap">Pashai</span>, the people of which have a peculiar language, and
    are Idolaters, of a brown complexion. They are great adepts in sorceries
    and the diabolic arts. The men wear earrings and brooches of gold and
    silver set with stones and pearls. They are a pestilent people and a
    crafty; and they live upon flesh and rice. Their country is very hot.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXX11" href="#Note_XXX11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>Now let us proceed and speak of another country which is seven days’
    journey from this one towards the south-east, and the name of which is
    <span class="smcap">Keshimur</span>.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXX11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXX11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The name of
      <span class="smcap">Pashai</span> has already occurred (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII1">ch. xviii.</a>) linked
      with <span class="smcap">Dir</span>, as indicating a tract, apparently of very rugged and difficult
      character, through which the partizan leader Nigúdar passed in making an
      incursion from Badakhshan towards Káshmir. The difficulty here lies in the
      name <em>Pashai</em>, which points to the south-west, whilst <em>Dir</em> and all other
      indications point to the south-east. But Pashai seems to me the reading
      to which all texts tend, whilst it is clearly expressed in the G.&nbsp;T.
      (<em>Pasciai</em>), and it is contrary to all my experience of the interpretation
      of Marco Polo to attempt to torture the name in the way which has been
      common with commentators professed and occasional. But dropping this name
      for a moment, let us see to what the other indications do point.</p>

    <p>In the meagre statements of this and the next chapter, interposed as
      they are among chapters of detail unusually ample for Polo, there is
      nothing to lead us to suppose that the Traveller ever personally visited
      the countries of which these two chapters treat. I believe we have here
      merely an amplification of the information already sketched of the country
      penetrated by the Nigudarian bands whose escapade is related in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII1">chapter
      xviii.</a>, information which was probably derived from a Mongol source. And
      these countries are in my belief <em>both</em> regions famous in the legends of
      the Northern Buddhists, viz. <span class="smcap">Udyána</span> and <span class="smcap">Káshmir</span>.</p>

    <p>Udyána lay to the north of Pesháwar on the Swát River, but from the extent
      assigned to it by Hiuen Tsang, the name probably covered a large part of
      the whole hill-region south of the Hindu-Kúsh from Chitrál to the Indus,
      as indeed it is represented in the Map of Vivien de St. Martin (<cite>Pèlerins
      Bouddhistes</cite>, II.). It is regarded by Fahian as the most northerly Province
      of India, and in his time the food and clothing of the people were similar
      to those of Gangetic India. It was the native country of Padma Sambhava,
      one of the chief apostles of Lamaism, <i>i.e.</i> of Tibetan Buddhism, and a great
      master of enchantments. The doctrines of Sakya, as they prevailed in Udyána
      in old times, were probably strongly tinged with Sivaitic magic, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>and the
      Tibetans still regard that locality as the classic ground of sorcery and
      witchcraft.</p>

    <p>Hiuen Tsang says of the inhabitants: “The men are of a soft and
      pusillanimous character, <em>naturally inclined to craft and trickery</em>.
      They are fond of study, but pursue it with no ardour. <em>The science of
      magical formulae is become a regular professional business with them</em>.
      They generally wear clothes of white cotton, and rarely use any other
      stuff. Their spoken language, in spite of some differences, has a strong
      resemblance to that of India.”</p>

    <p>These particulars suit well with the slight description in our text,
      and the Indian atmosphere that it suggests; and the direction and
      distance ascribed to Pashai suit well with Chitral, which may be taken as
      representing Udyána when approached from Badakhshan. For it would be quite
      practicable for a party to reach the town of Chitrál in ten days from the
      position assigned to the old capital of Badakhshan. And from Chitrál the
      road towards Káshmir would lie over the high Lahori pass to <span class="smcap">Dir</span>, which
      from its mention in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII1">chapter xviii.</a> we must consider an obligatory point.
      (<cite>Fah-hian</cite>, p. 26; <cite>Koeppen</cite>, I. 70; <cite>Pèlerins Boud.</cite> II. 131–132.)</p>

    <p>[“Tao-lin (a Buddhist monk like Hiuen Tsang) afterwards left the
      western regions and changed his road to go to Northern India; he made a
      pilgrimage to <em>Kia-che-mi-louo</em> (Káshmir), and then entered the country of
      <em>U-ch’ang-na</em> (Udyána)....” (Ed. Chavannes, <cite>I-tsing</cite>, p. 105.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>We must now turn to the name <em>Pashai</em>. The Pashai Tribe are now Mahomedan,
      but are reckoned among the aboriginal inhabitants of the country, which
      the Afghans are not. Baber mentions them several times, and counts their
      language as one of the dozen that were spoken at Kabul in his time.
      Burnes says it resembles that of the Kafirs. A small vocabulary of it was
      published by Leech, in the seventh volume of the <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite>, which I
      have compared with vocabularies of Siah-posh Kafir, published by Raverty
      in vol. xxxiii. of the same journal, and by Lumsden in his <cite>Report of the
      Mission to Kandahar</cite>, in 1837. Both are Aryan, and seemingly of Professor
      Max Müller’s class <em>Indic</em>, but not <em>very</em> close to one another.<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>Ibn Batuta, after crossing the Hindu-Kúsh by one of the passes at the
      head of the Panjshir Valley, reaches the Mountain <span class="smcap">Bashái</span> (Pashai). In the
      same vicinity the Pashais are mentioned by Sidi ’Ali, in 1554. And it is
      still in the neighbourhood of Panjshir that the tribe is most numerous,
      though they have other settlements in the hill-country about Nijrao, and
      on the left bank of the Kabul River between Kabul and Jalalabad. <em>Pasha</em>
      and <em>Pasha</em>-gar is also named as one of the chief divisions of the Kafirs,
      and it seems a fair conjecture that it represents those of the Pashais
      who resisted or escaped conversion to Islam. (See <cite>Leech’s Reports</cite> in
      Collection pub. at Calcutta in 1839; <cite>Baber</cite>, 140; <cite>Elphinstone</cite>, I. 411;
      <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite> VII. 329, 731, XXVIII. 317 <i>seqq.</i>, XXXIII. 271–272; <cite>I. B.</cite>
      III. 86; <cite>J. As.</cite> IX. 203, and <cite>J. R. A. S.</cite> <span class="smcap">n.s.</span> V. 103, 278.)</p>

    <p>The route of which Marco had heard must almost certainly have been one of
      those leading by the high Valley of Zebák, and by the Doráh or the Nuksán
      Pass, over the watershed of Hindu-Kúsh into Chitrál, and so to Dir, as
      already noticed. The difficulty remains as to how he came to apply the name
      <em>Pashai</em> to the country south-east of Badakhshan. I cannot tell. But it is
      at least possible that the name of the Pashai tribe (of which the branches
      even now are spread over a considerable extent of country) may have once
      had a wide application over the southern spurs of the Hindu-Kúsh.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Our
      Author, moreover, is speaking here from hearsay, and hearsay geography
      without maps is much given to generalising. I apprehend that, along with
      characteristics specially referable to the Tibetan and Mongol traditions of
      Udyána, the term Pashai, as Polo uses it, vaguely covers the whole tract
      from the southern boundary of Badakhshan to the Indus and the Kabul River.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

    <p>But even by extending its limits to Attok, we shall not get within seven
      marches of Káshmir. It is 234 miles by road from Attok to Srinagar; more
      than twice seven marches. And, according to Polo’s usual system, the
      marches should be counted from Chitrál, or some point thereabouts.</p>

    <p>Sir H. Rawlinson, in his <cite>Monograph on the Oxus</cite>, has indicated the
      probability that the name <em>Pashai</em> may have been originally connected with
      <em>Aprasin</em> or <em>Paresín</em>, the Zendavestian name for the Indian Caucasus, and
      which occurs in the Babylonian version of the Behistun Inscription as the
      equivalent of Gadára in the Persian, <i>i.e.</i> <em>Gandhára</em>, there applied to the
      whole country between Bactria and the Indus. (See <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XLII. 502.)
      Some such traditional application of the term Pashai might have survived.</p>

  <p>The men are brown and lean, but the women, taking them as brunettes, are

    clime is finely tempered, being neither very hot nor very cold. There are
    numbers of towns and villages in the country, but also forests and desert
    tracts, and strong passes, so that the people have no fear of anybody,

    <p><a id="Note_XXXI11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—I apprehend that in this chapter Marco represents Buddhism (which
      is to be understood by his expression <em>Idolatry</em>, not always, but usually)
      as in a position of greater life and prosperity than we can believe it to
      have enjoyed in Káshmir at the end of the 13th century, and I suppose that
      his knowledge of it was derived in great part from tales of the Mongol and
      Tibetan Buddhists about its past glories.</p>

    <p>I know not if the spelling <em>Kesciemur</em> represents any peculiar Mongol
      pronunciation of the name. Plano Carpini, probably the first modern
      European to mention this celebrated region, calls it <cite>Casmir</cite> (p. 708).</p>

    <p>“The Cashmeerians,” says Abu’l Fazl, “have a language of their own, but
      their books are written in the Shanskrit tongue, although the character is
      sometimes Cashmeerian. They write chiefly upon <em>Tooz</em> [birch-bark], which
      is the bark of a tree; it easily divides into leaves, and remains perfect
      for many years.” (<cite>Ayeen Akbery</cite>, II. 147.) A sketch of Kashmiri Grammar by
      Mr. Edgeworth will be found in vol. x. of the <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite>, and a fuller
      one by Major Leech in vol. xiii. Other contributions on the language are in
      vol. xxxv. pt. i. p. 233 (Godwin-Austen); in vol. xxxix. pt. i. p. 95 (Dr.
      Elmslie); and in <cite>Proceedings</cite> for 1866, p. 62, <i>seqq.</i> (Sir G. Campbell and
      Bábú Rájendra Lál Mitra). The language, though in large measure of Sanskrit
      origin, has words and forms that cannot be traced in any other Indian
      vernacular. (<cite>Campbell</cite>, pp. 67, 68). The character is a modification of
      the Panjáb Nagari.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXI12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXI12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—The Kashmirian conjurers had made a great impression on Marco, who
      had seen them at the Court of the Great Kaan, and he recurs in a later
      chapter to their weather sorceries and other enchantments, when we shall
      make some remarks. Meanwhile let us cite a passage from Bernier, already
      quoted by M. Pauthier. When crossing the Pír Panjál (the mountain crossed
      on entering Káshmir from Lahore) with the camp of Aurangzíb, he met with
      “an old Hermit who had dwelt upon the summit of the Pass since the days
      of Jehangir, and whose religion nobody knew, although it was said that he
      could work miracles, and used at his pleasure to produce extraordinary
      thunderstorms, as well as hail, snow, rain, and wind. There was something
      wild in his countenance, and in his long, spreading, and tangled hoary
      beard. He asked alms fiercely, allowing the travellers to drink from
      earthen cups that he had set out upon a great stone, but signing to them to
      go quickly by without stopping. He scolded those who made a noise, ‘for,’
      said he to me (after I had entered his cave and smoothed him down with a
      half rupee which I put in his hand with all humility), ‘noise here raises
      furious storms. Aurangzíb has done well in taking my advice and prohibiting
      it. Shah Jehan always did the like. But Jehangir once chose to laugh at
      what I said, and made his drums and trumpets sound; the consequence was he
      nearly lost his life.’” (<cite>Bernier</cite>, Amst. ed. 1699, II. 290.) A successor
      of this hermit was found on the same spot by P. Desideri in 1713, and
      another by Vigne in 1837.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXI13" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXI13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Though the earliest entrance of Buddhism into Tibet was from India
      Proper, yet Káshmir twice in the history of Tibetan Buddhism played a most
      important part. It was in Káshmir that was gathered, under the patronage
      of the great King Kanishka, soon after our era, the Fourth Buddhistic
      Council, which marks the point of separation between Northern and Southern
      Buddhism. Numerous missionaries went forth from Káshmir to spread the
      doctrine in Tibet and in Central Asia. Many of the Pandits who laboured at
      the translation of the sacred books into Tibetan were Kashmiris, and it was
      even in Káshmir that several of the translations were made. But these were
      not the only circumstances that made Káshmir a holy land to the Northern
      Buddhists. In the end of the 9th century the religion was extirpated in
      Tibet by the Julian of the Lamas, the great persecutor Langdarma, and when
      it was restored, a century later, it was from Káshmir in particular that
      fresh missionaries were procured to reinstruct the people in the forgotten
      Law. (See <cite>Koeppen</cite>, II. 12–13, 78; <cite>J. As.</cite> sér. VI. tom. vi. 540.)</p>

    <p>“The spread of Buddhism to Káshmir is an event of extraordinary importance
      in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>the history of that religion. Thenceforward that country became a
      mistress in the Buddhist Doctrine and the headquarters of a particular
      school.... The influence of Káshmir was very marked, especially in the
      spread of Buddhism beyond India. From Káshmir it penetrated to Kandahar and
      Kabul, ... and thence over Bactria. Tibetan Buddhism also had its essential
      origin from Káshmir; ... so great is the importance of this region in the
      History of Buddhism.” (<cite>Vassilyev, Der Buddhismus</cite>, I. 44.)</p>

    <p>In the account which the Mahawanso gives of the consecration of the great
      Tope at Ruanwelli, by Dutthagamini, King of Ceylon (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 157), 280,000
      priests (!) come from Káshmir, a far greater number than is assigned to any
      other country except one. (<cite>J. A. S. B.</cite> VII. 165.)</p>

    <p>It is thus very intelligible how Marco learned from the Mongols and the
      Lamas with whom he came in contact to regard Káshmir as “the very original
      source from which their Religion had spread abroad.” The feeling with which
      they looked to Káshmir must have been nearly the same as that with which
      the Buddhists of Burma look to Ceylon. But this feeling towards Káshmir
      does not <em>now</em>, I am informed, exist in Tibet. The reverence for the
      holy places has reverted to Bahár and the neighbouring “cradle-lands” of
      Buddhism.</p>

    <p>It is notable that the historian Firishta, in a passage quoted by Tod, uses
      Marco’s expression in reference to Káshmir, almost precisely, saying that
      the Hindoos derived their idolatry from Káshmir, “the foundry of magical
      superstition.” (<cite>Rajasthan</cite>, I. 219.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXI14" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXI14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—The people of Káshmir retain their beauty, but they are morally
      one of the most degraded races in Asia. Long oppression, now under the
      Lords of Jamu as great as ever, has no doubt aggravated this. Yet it would
      seem that twelve hundred years ago the evil elements were there as well
      as the beauty. The Chinese traveller says: “Their manners are light and
      volatile, their characters effeminate and pusillanimous.... They are very
      handsome, but their natural bent is to fraud and trickery.” (<cite>Pèl. Boud.</cite>
      II. 167–168.) Vigne’s account is nearly the same. (II. 142–143.) “They are
      as mischievous as monkeys, and far more malicious,” says Mr. Shaw (p. 292).</p>

    <p>[Bernier says: “The women [of Kachemire] especially are very handsome; and
      it is from this country that nearly every individual, when first admitted
      to the court of the Great Mogul, selects wives or concubines, that his
      children may be whiter than the Indians, and pass for genuine Moguls.
      Unquestionably, there must be beautiful women among the higher classes,
      if we may judge by those of the lower orders seen in the streets and in
      the shops.” (<cite>Travels in the Mogul Empire</cite>, edited by Archibald Constable,
      1891, p. 404.)]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXI15" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXI15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—In the time of Hiuen Tsang, who spent two years studying in
      Káshmir in the first half of the 7th century, though there were many
      Brahmans in the country, Buddhism was in a flourishing state; there were
      100 convents with about 5000 monks. In the end of the 11th century a King
      (Harshadeva, 1090–1102) is mentioned <em>exceptionally</em> as a protector of
      Buddhism. The supposition has been intimated above that Marco’s picture
      refers to a traditional state of things, but I must notice that a like
      picture is presented in the Chinese account of Hulaku’s war. One of the
      thirty kingdoms subdued by the Mongols was “The kingdom of Fo (Buddha)
      called <em>Kishimi</em>. It lies to the N.W. of India. There are to be seen the
      men who are counted the successors of Shakia; their ancient and venerable
      air recalls the countenance of Bodi-dharma as one sees it in pictures. They
      abstain from wine, and content themselves with a gill of rice for their
      daily food, and are occupied only in reciting the prayers and litanies of
      Fo.” (<cite>Rém. N. Mél. Asiat.</cite> I. 179.) Abu’l Fazl says that on his third
      visit with Akbar to Káshmir he discovered some old men of the religion of
      Buddha, but none of them were <em>literati</em>. The <em>Rishis</em>, of whom he speaks
      with high commendation as abstaining from meat and from female society, as
      charitable <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>and unfettered by traditions, were perhaps a modified remnant of
      the Buddhist Eremites. Colonel Newall, in a paper on the Rishis of Káshmir,
      traces them to a number of Shiáh Sayads, who fled to Káshmir in the time of
      Timur. But evidently the <em>genus</em> was of much earlier date, long preceding
      the introduction of Islam. (<cite>Vie et V. de H. T.</cite> p. 390; <cite>Lassen</cite>, III.
      709; <cite>Ayeen Akb.</cite> II. 147, III. 151; <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite> XXXIX. pt. i. 265.)</p>

    <p>We see from the <em>Dabistan</em> that in the 17th century Káshmir continued to
      be a great resort of Magian mystics and sages of various sects, professing
      great abstinence and credited with preternatural powers. And indeed
      Vámbéry tells us that even in our own day the Kashmiri Dervishes are
      pre-eminent among their Mahomedan brethren for cunning, secret arts, skill
      in exorcisms, etc. (<cite>Dab.</cite> I. 113 <i>seqq.</i> II. 147–148; <cite>Vámb. Sk. of Cent.

    <p><a id="Note_XXXI16" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXI16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—The first precept of the Buddhist Decalogue, or Ten Obligations
      of the Religious Body, is not to take life. But <em>animal food</em> is not
      forbidden, though restricted. Indeed it is one of the circumstances in the
      Legendary History of Sakya Muni, which looks as if it <em>must</em> be true, that
      he is related to have aggravated his fatal illness by eating a dish of pork
      set before him by a hospitable goldsmith. Giorgi says the butchers in Tibet
      are looked on as infamous; and people selling sheep or the like will make
      a show of exacting an assurance that these are not to be slaughtered. In
      Burma, when a British party wanted beef, the owner of the bullocks would
      decline to make one over, but would point one out that might be shot by the
      foreigners.</p>

    <p>In Tibetan history it is told of the persecutor Langdarma that he compelled
      members of the highest orders of the clergy to become hunters and butchers.
      A Chinese collection of epigrams, dating from the 9th century, gives a
      facetious list of <em>Incongruous Conditions</em>, among which we find a poor
      Parsi, a sick Physician, a fat Bride, a Teacher who does not know his
      letters, and <em>a Butcher who reads the Scriptures</em> (of Buddhism)! (<cite>Alph.

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XXXII1"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER XXXII</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Great River of Badashan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> leaving Badashan you ride twelve days between east and north-east,
    ascending a river that runs through land belonging to a brother of the
    Prince of Badashan, and containing a good many towns and villages and
    scattered habitations. The people are Mahommetans, and valiant in war.
    At the end of those twelve days you come to a province of no great size,
    extending indeed no more <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>than three days’ journey in any direction, and
    this is called <span class="smcap">Vokhan</span>. The people worship Mahommet, and they have a
    peculiar language. They are gallant soldiers, and they have a chief whom
    they call <span class="smcap">None</span>, which is as much as to say <em>Count</em>, and they are liegemen
    to the Prince of Badashan.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXII11" href="#Note_XXXII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>There are numbers of wild beasts of all sorts in this region. And when
    you leave this little country, and ride three days north-east, always
    among mountains, you get to such a height that ’tis said to be the highest
    place in the world! And when you have got to this height you find [a great
    lake between two mountains, and out of it] a fine river running through a
    plain clothed with the finest pasture in the world; insomuch that a lean
    beast there will fatten to your heart’s content in ten days. There are
    great numbers of all kinds of wild beasts; among others, wild sheep of
    great size, whose horns are good six palms in length. From these horns
    the shepherds make great bowls to eat from, and they use the horns also
    to enclose folds for their cattle at night. [Messer Marco was told also
    that the wolves were numerous, and killed many of those wild sheep. Hence
    quantities of their horns and bones were found, and these were made into
    great heaps by the way-side, in order to guide travellers when snow was on
    the ground.]</p>

  <p>The plain is called <span class="smcap">Pamier</span>, and you ride across it for twelve days
    together, finding nothing but a desert without habitations or any green
    thing, so that travellers are obliged to carry with them whatever they have
    need of. The region is so lofty and cold that you do not even see any birds
    flying. And I must notice also that because of this great cold, fire does
    not burn so brightly, nor give out so much heat as usual, nor does it cook
    food so effectually.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXII12" href="#Note_XXXII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>Now, if we go on with our journey towards the east-north-east, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>we travel a
    good forty days, continually passing over mountains and hills, or through
    valleys, and crossing many rivers and tracts of wilderness. And in all this
    way you find neither habitation of man, nor any green thing, but must carry
    with you whatever you require. The country is called <span class="smcap">Bolor</span>. The people
    dwell high up in the mountains, and are savage Idolaters, living only by
    the chase, and clothing themselves in the skins of beasts. They are in
    truth an evil race.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXII13" href="#Note_XXXII13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXXII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—[“The length of Little Pamir, according to Trotter, is 68 miles....
      To find the twelve days’ ride in the plain of Marco Polo, it must be
      admitted, says Severtsof (<cite>Bul. Soc. Géog.</cite> XI. 1890, pp. 588–589), that
      he went down a considerable distance along the south-north course of the
      Aksu, in the Aktash Valley, and did not turn towards Tásh Kurgán, by the
      Neza Tash Pass, crossed by Gordon and Trotter. The descent from this pass
      to Tásh Kurgán finishes with a difficult and narrow defile, which may well
      be overflowed at the great melting of snow, from the end of May till the
      middle of June, even to July.</p>

    <p>“Therefore he must have left the Aksu Valley to cross the Pass of Tagharma,
      about 50 or 60 kilometres to the north of the Neza Tash Pass; thence to
      Kashgar, the distance, in a straight line, is about 200 kilometres, and
      less than 300 by the shortest route which runs from the Tagharma Pass to
      little Kara Kul, and from there down to Yangi Hissar, along the Ghidjik.
      And Marco Polo assigns <em>forty</em> days for this route, while he allows but
      <em>thirty</em> for the journey of 500 kilometres (at least) from Jerm to the foot
      of the Tagharma Pass.”</p>

    <p>Professor Paquier (<cite>Bul. Soc. Géog.</cite> 6<sup>e</sup> Sér. XII. pp. 121–125) remarks
      that the Moonshee, sent by Captain Trotter to survey the Oxus between
      Ishkashm and Kila Wamár, could not find at the spot marked by Yule on
      his map, the mouth of the Shakh-Dara, but northward 7 or 8 miles from
      the junction of the Murghab with the Oxus, he saw the opening of an
      important water-course, the Suchnan River, formed by the Shakh-Dara and the
      Ghund-Dara. Marco arrived at a place between Northern Wakhán and Shihgnan;
      from the Central Pamir, Polo would have taken a route identical with that
      of the Mirza (1868–1869) by the Chichiklik Pass. Professor Paquier adds: “I
      have no hesitation in believing that Marco Polo was in the neighbourhood
      of that great commercial road, which by the <i lang="la">Vallis Comedarum</i> reached
      the foot of the Imaüs. He probably did not venture on a journey of fifty
      marches in an unknown country. At the top of the Shihgnan Valley, he
      doubtless found a road marked out to Little Bukharia. This was the road
      followed in ancient times from Bactrian to Serica; and Ptolemy has, so
      to speak, given us its landmarks after Marinus of Tyre, by the <i lang="la">Vallis
      Comedarum</i> (Valley of actual Shihgnan); the <i lang="la">Turris Lapidea</i> and the
      <i lang="la">Statio Mercatorum</i>, neighbourhood of Tásh Kurgán, capital of the present
      province of Sar-i-kol.”</p>

    <p>I must say that accepting, as I do, for Polo’s Itinerary, the route from
      Wakhán to Kashgar by the Taghdum-Bash Pamir, and Tásh Kurgán, I do not
      agree with Professor Paquier’s theory. But though I prefer Sir H. Yule’s
      route from Badakhshan, by the River Vardoj, the Pass of Ishkashm, the
      Panja, to Wakhán, I do not accept his views for the Itinerary from Wakhán
      to Kashgar; see <a href="#Page_175">p. 175</a>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The river along which Marco travels from Badakhshan is no doubt the upper
      stream of the Oxus, known locally as the Panja, along which Wood also
      travelled, followed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>of late by the Mirza and Faiz Bakhsh. It is true that
      the river is reached from Badaskhshan Proper by ascending another river
      (the Vardoj) and crossing the Pass of Ishkáshm, but in the brief style of
      our narrative we must expect such condensation.</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Wakhán</span> was restored to geography by Macartney, in the able map which he
      compiled for Elphinstone’s <cite>Caubul</cite>, and was made known more accurately by
      Wood’s journey through it. [The district of Wakhán “comprises the valleys
      containing the two heads of the Panjah branch of the Oxus, and the valley
      of the Panjah itself, from the junction at Zung down to Ishkashím. The
      northern branch of the Panjah has its principal source in the Lake Victoria
      in the Great Pamir, which as well as the Little Pamir, belongs to Wakhán,
      the Aktash River forming the well recognized boundary between Kashgaria
      and Wakhán.” (Captain Trotter, <cite>Forsyth’s Mission</cite>, p. 275.) The southern
      branch is the Sarhadd Valley.—H.&nbsp;C.] The lowest part is about 8000 feet
      above the sea, and the highest <em>Kishlak</em>, or village, about 11,500. A few
      willows and poplars are the only trees that can stand against the bitter
      blasts that blow down the valley. Wood estimated the total population of
      the province at only 1000 souls, though it might be capable of supporting
      5000.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He saw it, however, in the depth of winter. As to the peculiar
      language, see note I, ch. xxix. It is said to be a very old dialect of
      Persian. A scanty vocabulary was collected by Hayward. (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXI.
      p. 29.) The people, according to Shaw, have Aryan features, resembling
      those of the Kashmiris, but harsher.</p>

    <p>[Cf. Captain Trotter’s <cite>The Oxus below Wakhan, Forsyth’s Mission</cite>, p. 276.]</p>

    <p>We appear to see in the indications of this paragraph precisely the same
      system of government that now prevails in the Oxus valleys. The central
      districts of Faizabad and Jerm are under the immediate administration of
      the Mír of Badakhshan, whilst fifteen other districts, such as <em>Kishm,
      Rusták, Zebák, Ishkáshm, Wakhán</em>, are dependencies “held by the <em>relations
      of the Mír</em>, or by hereditary rulers, on a feudal tenure, conditional on
      fidelity and military service in time of need, the holders possessing
      supreme authority in their respective territories, and paying little or no
      tribute to the paramount power.” (<cite>Pandit Manphul</cite>.) The first part of the
      valley of which Marco speaks as belonging to a brother of the Prince, may
      correspond to Ishkáshm, or perhaps to Vardoj; the second, Wakhán, seems
      to have had a hereditary ruler; but both were vassals of the Prince of
      Badakhshan, and therefore are styled <em>Counts</em>, not kings or <em>Seigneurs</em>.</p>

    <p>The native title which Marco gives as the equivalent of Count is
      remarkable. <em>Non</em> or <em>None</em>, as it is variously written in the texts, would
      in French form represent <em>Nono</em> in Italian. Pauthier refers this title to
      the “<em>Rao</em>-nana (or nano) <em>Rao</em>” which figures as the style of Kanerkes in
      the Indo-Scythic coinage. But Wilson (<cite>Ariana Antiqua</cite>, p. 358) interprets
      <em>Raonano</em> as most probably a genitive plural of Rao, whilst the whole
      inscription answers precisely to the Greek one <span lang="el">ΒΑΣΙΛΕΥΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΚΑΝΗΡΚΟΥ</span>,
      which is found on other coins of the same prince. General
      Cunningham, a very competent authority, adheres to this view, and writes:
      “I do not think <em>None</em> or <em>Non</em> can have any connection with the <em>Nana</em> of
      the coins.”</p>

    <p>It is remarkable, however, that <span class="smcap">Nono</span> (said to signify “younger,” or lesser)
      is in Tibet the title given to a younger brother, deputy, or subordinate
      prince. In Cunningham’s <cite>Ladak</cite> (259) we read: “<em>Nono</em> is the usual term
      of respect which is used in addressing any young man of the higher ranks,
      and when prefixed to <em>Kahlon</em> it means the younger or deputy minister.”
      And again (p. 352): “<em>Nono</em> is the title given to a younger brother. Nono
      Sungnam was the younger brother of Chang <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>Raphtan, the Kahlon of Bazgo.”
      I have recently encountered the word used independently, and precisely
      in Marco’s application of it. An old friend, in speaking of a journey
      that he had made in our Tibetan provinces, said incidentally that he had
      accompanied the commissioner <em>to the installation of a new</em> <span class="smcap">Nono</span> (I think
      in Spiti). The term here corresponds so precisely with the explanation
      which Marco gives of <em>None</em> as a Count subject to a superior sovereign,
      that it is difficult to regard the coincidence as accidental. The <em>Yuechi</em>
      or Indo-Scyths who long ruled the Oxus countries are said to have been of
      Tibetan origin, and Al-Biruni repeats a report that this was so. (<cite>Elliot.</cite>
      II. 9.)<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Can this title have been a trace of their rule? Or is it Indian?</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXII12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—This chapter is one of the most interesting in the book, and
      contains one of its most splendid anticipations of modern exploration,
      whilst conversely Lieutenant John Wood’s narrative presents the most
      brilliant confirmation in detail of Marco’s narrative.</p>

    <p>We have very old testimony to the recognition of the great altitude of
      the Plateau of <span class="smcap">Pamir</span> (the name which Marco gives it and which it still
      retains), and to the existence of the lake (or lakes) upon its surface.
      The Chinese pilgrims Hwui Seng and Sung Yun, who passed this way <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 518,
      inform us that these high lands of the Tsung Ling were commonly said to be
      midway between heaven and earth. The more celebrated Hiuen Tsang, who came
      this way nearly 120 years later (about 644) on his return to China, “after
      crossing the mountains for 700 <i>li</i>, arrived at the valley of <em>Pomilo</em>
      (Pamir). This valley is 1000 <i>li</i> (about 200 miles) from east to west, and
      100 <i>li</i> (20 miles) from north to south, and lies between two snowy ranges
      in the centre of the Tsung Ling mountains. The traveller is annoyed by
      sudden gusts of wind, and the snow-drifts never cease, spring or summer. As
      the soil is almost constantly frozen, you see but a few miserable plants,
      and no crops can live. The whole tract is but a dreary waste, without
      a trace of human kind. In the middle of the valley is a great lake 300
      <i>li</i> (60 miles) from east to west, and 500 <i>li</i> from north to south. This
      stands in the centre of Jambudwipa (the Buddhist <span lang="el">οἰκουμένη</span>) on a
      plateau of prodigious elevation. An endless variety of creatures peoples
      its waters. When you hear the murmur and clash of its waves you think you
      are listening to the noisy hum of a great market in which vast crowds of
      people are mingling in excitement.... The lake discharges to the west, and
      a river runs out of it in that direction and joins the <em>Potsu</em> (Oxus)....
      The lake likewise discharges to the east, and a great river runs out,
      which flows eastward to the western frontier of <em>Kiesha</em> (Káshgar), where
      it joins the River Sita, and runs eastward with it into the sea.” The
      story of an eastern outflow from the lake is, no doubt, legend, connected
      with an ancient Hindu belief (see <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 347), but Burnes in modern
      times heard much the same story. And the Mirza, in 1868, took up the same
      impression regarding the smaller lake called Pamir Kul, in which the
      southern branch of the Panja originates.</p>

    <p>“After quitting the (frozen) surface of the river,” says Wood, “we ...
      ascended a low hill, which apparently bounded the valley to the eastward.
      On surmounting this, at 3 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> of the 19th February, 1838, we stood, to
      use a native expression, upon the <em>Bám-i-Duniah</em>, or ‘Roof of the World,’
      while before us lay stretched a noble but frozen sheet of water, from whose
      western end issued the infant river of the Oxus. This fine lake (Sirikol)
      lies in the form of a crescent, about 14 miles long from east to west, by
      an average breadth of 1 mile. On three sides it is bordered by swelling
      hills about 500 feet high, while along its southern bank they rise into
      mountains 3500 feet above the lake, or 19,000 feet above the sea, and
      covered with perpetual snow, from which never-failing source the lake is
      supplied.... Its elevation, measured by the temperature of boiling water,
      is 15,600 feet.”</p>

    <p>The absence of birds on Pamir, reported by Marco, probably shows that
      he passed very late or early in the season. Hiuen Tsang, we see, gives
      a different account; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>Wood was there in the winter, but heard that in
      summer the lake swarmed with water-fowl. [Cf. Captain Trotter, p. 263, in
      <cite>Forsyth’s Mission</cite>.]</p>

    <p>The Pamir Steppe was crossed by Benedict Goës late in the autumn of
      1603, and the narrative speaks of the great cold and desolation, and
      the difficulty of breathing. We have also an abstract of the journey of
      Abdul Mejid, a British Agent, who passed Pamir on his way to Kokan in
      1861:—“Fourteen weary days were occupied in crossing the steppe; the
      marches were long, depending on uncertain supplies of grass and water,
      which sometimes wholly failed them; food for man and beast had to be
      carried with the party, for not a trace of human habitation is to be met
      with in those inhospitable wilds.... The steppe is interspersed with
      tamarisk jungle and the wild willow, and in the summer with tracts of high
      grass.” (<cite>Neumann</cite>, <cite>Pilgerfahrten Buddh. Priester</cite>, p. 50; <cite>V. et V. de H.
      T.</cite> 271–272; <cite>Wood</cite>, 232; <cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> X. 150.)</p>

    <p>There is nothing absolutely to decide whether Marco’s route from Wakhán
      lay by Wood’s Lake “Sirikol,” or Victoria, or by the more southerly source
      of the Oxus in Pamir Kul. These routes would unite in the valley of
      Táshkurgán, and his road thence to Kashgar was, I apprehend, nearly the
      same as the Mirza’s in 1868–1869, by the lofty Chichiklik Pass and Kin
      Valley. But I cannot account for the forty days of wilderness. The Mirza
      was but thirty-four days <em>from Faizabad to Kashgar</em>, and Faiz Bakhsh only
      twenty-five.</p>

    <p>[Severtsof (<cite>Bul. Soc. Géog.</cite> XI. 1890, p. 587), who accepts Trotter’s
      route, by the Pamir Khurd (Little Pamir), says there are three routes from
      Wakhán to Little Pamir, going up the Sarhadd: one during the winter, by the
      frozen river; the two others available during the spring and the summer,
      up and down the snowy chain along the right bank of the Sarhadd, until the
      valley widens out into a plain, where a swelling is hardly to be seen, so
      flat is it; this chain is the dividing ridge between the Sarhadd and the
      Aksu. From the summit, the traveller, looking towards the west, sees <em>at
      his feet</em> the mountains he has crossed; to the east, the Pamir Kul and
      the Aksu, the river flowing from it. The pasture grounds around the Pamir
      Kul and the sources of the Sarhadd are magnificent; but lower down, the
      Aksu valley is arid, <em>dotted</em> only with pasture grounds of little extent,
      and few and far between. It is to this part of Pamir that Marco Polo’s
      description applies; more than any other part of this <em>ensemble</em> of high
      valleys, this line of water parting, of the Sarhadd and the Aksu, has the
      aspect of a <em>Roof of the World</em> (<em>Bam-i-dunya</em>, Persian name of Pamir).—H.&nbsp;C.].</p>

    <p>[We can trace Marco Polo’s route from Wakhán, on comparing it with Captain
      Younghusband’s Itinerary from Kashgar, which he left on the 22nd July,
      1891, for Little Pamir: Little Pamir at Bozai-Gumbaz, joins with the
      Pamir-i-Wakhán at the Wakhijrui Pass, first explored by Colonel Lockhart’s
      mission. Hence the route lies by the old fort of Kurgan-i-Ujadbai at the
      junction of the two branches of the Tagh-dum-bash Pamir (Supreme Head of
      the Mountains), the Tagh-dum-bash Pamir, Tásh Kurgán, Bulun Kul, the Gez
      Defile and Kashgar. (<cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> XIV. 1892, pp. 205–234.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>We may observe that Severtsof asserts <em>Pamir</em> to be a generic term, applied
      to all high plateaux in the Thian Shan.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

    <p>[“The Pámír plateau may be described as a great, broad, rounded ridge,
      extending north and south, and crossed by thick mountain chains, between
      which lie elevated valleys, open and gently sloping towards the east, but
      narrow and confined, with a rapid fall towards the west. The waters which
      run in all, with the exception of the eastern flow from the Tághdúngbásh,
      collect in the Oxus; the Áksú from the Little Pámír lake receiving the
      eastern drainage, which finds an outlet in the Áktásh Valley, and joining
      the Múrgháb, which obtains that from the Alichór and Síríz Pámírs. As
      the eastern Tághdúngbásh stream finds its way into the Yarkand river,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>the watershed must be held as extending from that Pámír, down the range
      dividing it from the Little Pámír, and along the Neza Tásh mountains to the
      Kizil Art Pass, leading to the Alái.” (Colonel Gordon, <cite>Forsyth’s Mission</cite>, p. 231.)</p>

    <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon (<cite>Forsyth’s Mission</cite>, p. 231) says also:
      “Regarding the name ‘Pámír,’ the meaning appears to be wilderness—a place
      depopulated, abandoned, waste, yet capable of habitation. I obtained this
      information on the Great Pámír from one of our intelligent guides, who said
      in explanation—‘In former days, when this part was inhabited by Kirghiz, as
      is shown by the ruins of their villages and burial-grounds, the valley was
      not all called Pámír, as it is now. It was known by its village names, as
      is the country beyond Sirikol, which being now occupied by Kirghiz is not
      known by one name, but partly as Chárling, Bas Robát, etc. If deserted it
      would be Pámír.’” In a note Sir T. D. Forsyth adds that the same explanation
      of the word was given to him at Yangi-Hissar, and that it is in fact a
      Khokandi-Turki word.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>It would seem, from such notices as have been received, that there is not,
      strictly speaking, one steppe called Pamir, but a variety of <em>Pamirs</em>,
      which are lofty valleys between ranges of hills, presenting luxuriant
      summer pasture, and with floors more or less flat, but nowhere more than 5
      or 6 miles in width and often much less.</p>

    <p>[This is quite exact; Mr. E. Delmar Morgan writes in the <cite>Scottish Geog.
      Mag.</cite> January, 1892, p. 17: “Following the terminology of Yule adopted by
      geographers, and now well established, we have (1) Pamir Alichur; (2) Pamir
      Khurd (or “Little”); (3) Pamir Kalan (or “Great”); (4) Pamir Khargosi (“of
      the hare”); (5) Pamir Sares; (6) Pamir Rang-kul.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      <div class="caption">Horns of <i>Ovis Poli</i>.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Wood speaks of the numerous wolves in this region. And the great sheep is
      that to which Blyth, in honour of our traveller, has given the name of
      <i>Ovis Poli</i>.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> A pair of horns, sent by Wood to the Royal Asiatic Society,
      and of which a representation is given above, affords the following
      dimensions:—Length of one horn on the curve, 4 feet 8 inches; round the
      base 14¼ inches; distance of tips apart 3 feet 9 inches. This sheep appears
      to be the same as the <em>Rass</em>, of which Burnes heard that the horns were
      so big that a man could not lift a pair, and that foxes bred in them;
      also that the carcass formed a load for two horses. Wood says that these
      horns supply shoes for the Kirghiz horses, and also a good substitute for
      stirrup-irons. “We saw numbers of horns strewed about in every direction,
      the spoils of the Kirghiz hunter. Some of these were of an astonishingly
      large size, and belonged to an animal of a species between a goat and a
      sheep, inhabiting the steppes of Pamir. <em>The ends of the horns projecting
      above the snow often indicated the direction of the road</em>; and wherever
      they were heaped in large quantities and disposed in a semicircle, there
      our escort recognised the site of a Kirghiz summer encampment.... We
      came in sight of a rough-looking building, decked out with the horns of
      the wild sheep, and all but buried amongst the snow. It was a Kirghiz
      burying-ground.” (Pp. 223, 229, 231.)</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

    <p>[With reference to Wood’s remark that the horns of the <i>Ovis Poli</i> supply
      shoes for the Kirghiz horses, Mr. Rockhill writes to me that a Paris
      newspaper of 24th November, 1894, observes: “Horn shoes made of the horn of
      sheep are successfully used in Lyons. They are especially adapted to horses
      employed in towns, where the pavements are often slippery. Horses thus shod
      can be driven, it is said, at the most rapid pace over the worst pavement
      without slipping.”</p>

    <p>(Cf. Rockhill, <cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 69; <cite>Chasses et Explorations dans la Région
      des Pamirs</cite>, par le Vte. Ed. de Poncins, Paris, 1897, 8vo.—H.&nbsp;C.).]</p>

    <p>In 1867 this great sheep was shot by M. Severtsof, on the Plateau of Aksai,
      in the western Thian Shan. He reports these animals to go in great herds,
      and to be very difficult to kill. However, he brought back two specimens.
      The Narin River is stated to be the northern limit of the species.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
      Severtsof also states that the enemies of the <i>Ovis Poli</i> are the wolves,
      [and Colonel Gordon says that the leopards and wolves prey almost entirely
      upon them. (On the <i>Ovis Poli</i>, see Captain Deasy, <cite>In Tibet</cite>, p. 361.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <div class="captionl antiqua" lang="fr">“Il hi a grant moutitude de mouton sauvages qe sunt grandisme, car ont les
      cornes bien six paumes” ...</div>

    <p>Colonel Gordon, the head of the exploring party detached by Sir Douglas
      Forsyth, brought away a head of <i>Ovis Poli</i>, which quite bears out the
      account by its eponymus of horns “good 6 palms in length,” say 60 inches.
      This head, as I learn from a letter of Colonel Gordon’s to a friend, has
      one horn perfect which measures 65½ inches on the curves; the other, broken
      at the tip, measures 64 inches; the straight line between the tips is 55
      inches.</p>

    <p>[Captain Younghusband [1886] “before leaving the Altai Mountains, picked up
      several heads of the <i>Ovis Poli</i>, called Argali by the Mongols. They were
      somewhat <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>different from those which I afterwards saw at Yarkand, which had
      been brought in from the Pamir. Those I found in the Gobi were considerably
      thicker at the base, there was a less degree of curve, and a shorter length
      of horn.” A full description of the <i>Ovis Poli</i>, with a large plate drawing
      of the horns, may be seen in Colonel Gordon’s <cite>Roof of the World</cite>. (See
      p. 81.) (<cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> X. 1888, p. 495.) Some years later, Captain
      Younghusband speaks repeatedly of the great sport of shooting <i>Ovis Poli</i>.
      (<cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> XIV. 1892, pp. 205, 234.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>As to the pasture, Timkowski heard that “the pasturage of Pamir is so
      luxuriant and nutritious, that if horses are left on it for more than forty
      days they die of repletion.” (I. 421.) And Wood: “The grass of Pamir, they
      tell you, is so rich that a sorry horse is here brought into good condition
      in less than twenty days; and its nourishing qualities are evidenced in the
      productiveness of their ewes, which almost invariably bring forth two lambs
      at a birth.” (P. 365.)</p>

    <p>With regard to the effect upon fire ascribed to the “great cold,” Ramusio’s
      version inserts the expression “<i lang="it">gli fu affermato per miracolo</i>,” “it was
      asserted to him as a wonderful circumstance.” And Humboldt thinks it so
      strange that Marco should not have observed this personally that he doubts
      whether Polo himself passed the Pamir. “How is it that he does not say that
      he himself had seen how the flames disperse and leap about, as I myself
      have so often experienced at similar altitudes in the Cordilleras of the
      Andes, especially when investigating the boiling-point of water?” (<cite>Cent.
      Asia</cite>, Germ. Transl. I. 588.) But the words quoted from Ramusio do not
      exist in the old texts, and they are probably an editorial interpolation
      indicating disbelief in the statement.</p>

    <p>MM. Huc and Gabet made a like observation on the high passes of
      north-eastern Tibet: “The <em>argols</em> gave out much smoke, but would not
      burn with any flame”; only they adopted the native idea that this as well
      as their own sufferings in respiration was caused by some pernicious
      exhalation.</p>

    <p>Major Montgomerie, R.E., of the Indian Survey, who has probably passed more
      time nearer the heavens than any man living, sends me the following note
      on this passage: “What Marco Polo says as to fire at great altitudes not
      cooking so effectually as usual is perfectly correct as far as anything
      <em>boiled</em> is concerned, but I doubt if it is as to anything <em>roasted</em>. The
      want of brightness in a fire at great altitudes is, I think, altogether
      attributable to the poorness of the fuel, which consists of either small
      sticks or bits of roots, or of <em>argols</em> of dung, all of which give out a
      good deal of smoke, more especially the latter if not quite dry; but I
      have often seen a capital blaze made with the argols when perfectly dry.
      As to cooking, we found that rice, <em>dál</em>, and potatoes would never soften
      properly, no matter how long they were boiled. This, of course, was due to
      the boiling-point being only from 170° to 180°. Our tea, moreover, suffered
      from the same cause, and was never good when we were over 15,000 feet. This
      was very marked. Some of my natives made dreadful complaints about the rice
      and dál that they got from the village-heads in the valleys, and vowed that
      they only gave them what was very old and hard, as they could not soften it!”</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXII13" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXII13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Bolor is a subject which it would take several pages to discuss
      with fulness, and I must refer for such fuller discussion to a paper in the
      <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> vol. xlii. p. 473.</p>

    <p>The name <em>Bolor</em> is very old, occurring in Hiuen Tsang’s Travels (7th
      century), and in still older Chinese works of like character. General
      Cunningham has told us that Balti is still termed <em>Balor</em> by the Dards of
      Gilghit; and Mr. Shaw, that <em>Palor</em> is an old name still sometimes used
      by the Kirghiz for the upper part of Chitrál. The indications of Hiuen
      Tsang are in accordance with General Cunningham’s information; and the
      fact that Chitrál is described under the name of Bolor in Chinese works
      of the last century entirely justifies that of Mr. Shaw. A Pushtu poem of
      the 17th century, translated by Major Raverty, assigns the mountains of
      <em>Bilaur</em>-istán, as the northern boundary of Swát. The collation of these
      indications shows that the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>term Bolor must have been applied somewhat
      extensively to the high regions adjoining the southern margin of Pamir. And
      a passage in the <cite>Táríkh Rashídí</cite>, written at Kashgar in the 16th century
      by a cousin of the great Baber, affords us a definition of the tract to
      which, in its larger sense, the name was thus applied: “<em>Malaur</em> (<i>i.e.</i>
      Balaur or Bolor) ... is a country with few level spots. It has a circuit of
      four months’ march. The eastern frontier borders on Kashgar and Yarkand; it
      has Badakhshan to the north, Kabul to the west, and Kashmír to the south.”
      The writer was thoroughly acquainted with his subject, and the region which
      he so defines must have embraced Sirikol and all the wild country south
      of Yarkand, Balti, Gilghit, Yasin, Chitrál, and perhaps Kafiristán. This
      enables us to understand Polo’s use of the term.</p>

    <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i178">
      <div class="caption"><b>MARCO POLO’S ITINERARIES N<sup>o</sup>. III.</b><br />

      <img class="w100" src="images/i178.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>

    <p>The name of Bolor in later days has been in a manner a symbol of
      controversy. It is prominent in the apocryphal travels of George Ludwig
      von ————, preserved in the Military Archives at St. Petersburg. That work
      represents a town of Bolor as existing to the north of Badakhshan, with
      Wakhán still further to the north. This geography we now know to be
      entirely erroneous, but it is in full accordance with the maps and tables
      of the Jesuit missionaries and their pupils, who accompanied the Chinese
      troops to Kashgar in 1758–1759. The paper in the <cite>Geographical Society’s
      Journal</cite>, which has been referred to, demonstrates how these erroneous
      data must have originated. It shows that the Jesuit geography was founded
      on downright accidental error, and, as a consequence, that the narratives
      which profess <em>de visu</em> to corroborate that geography must be downright
      forgeries. When the first edition was printed, I retained the belief in a
      <em>Bolor</em> where the Jesuits placed it.</p>

    <p>[The Chinese traveller, translated by M. Gueluy (<cite>Desc. de la Chine occid.</cite>
      p. 53), speaks of Bolor, to the west of Yarkand, inhabited by Mahomedans
      who live in huts; the country is sandy and rather poor. Severtsof says,
      (<cite>Bul. Soc. Géog.</cite> XI. 1890, p. 591) that he believes that the name of
      <em>Bolor</em> should be expunged from geographical nomenclature as a source of
      confusion and error. Humboldt, with his great authority, has too definitely
      attached this name to an erroneous orographical system. Lieutenant-Colonel
      Gordon says that he “made repeated enquiries from Kirghiz and Wakhis, and
      from the Mír [of Wakhán], Fatteh Ali Shah, regarding ‘Bólór,’ as a name for
      any mountain, country, or place, but all professed perfect ignorance of
      it.” (<cite>Forsyth’s Mission.</cite>)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The <cite>J. A. S. Bengal</cite> for 1853 (vol. xxii.) contains extracts from the
      diary of a Mr. Gardiner in those central regions of Asia. These read
      more like the memoranda of a dyspeptic dream than anything else, and the
      only passage I can find illustrative of our traveller is the following;
      the region is described as lying twenty days south-west of Kashgar: “The
      Keiaz tribe live in caves on the highest peaks, subsist by hunting, keep
      no flocks, said to be anthropophagous, but have handsome women; eat their
      flesh raw.” (P. 295; <cite>Pèlerins Boud.</cite> III. 316, 421, etc.; <cite>Ladak</cite>, 34, 45,
      47; <cite>Mag. Asiatique</cite>, I. 92, 96–97; <cite>Not. et Ext.</cite> II. 475, XIV. 492; <cite>J.

    <p>As this sheet goes finally to press we hear of the exploration of Pamir
      by officers of Mr. Forsyth’s Mission. [I have made use of the information

      followed the route from Táshkurgán through the Gez Defile.</p>

    <p>The Itinerary of the Mirza from Badakhshan (Fáizabad) is the following:
      Zebák, Ishkashm, on the Panja, which may be considered the beginning of
      the Wakhán Valley, Panja Fort, in Wakhán, Raz Khan, Patur, near Lunghar
      (commencement of Pamir Steppe), Pamir Kul, or Barkút Yassin, 13,300 feet,
      Aktash, Sirikul Táshkurgán, Shukrab, Chichik Dawan, Akul, Kotul, Chahul
      Station (road to Yarkand), Kila Karawal, Aghiz Gah, Yangi-Hissar, Opechan,
      Yanga Shahr, Kashgar, where he arrived on the 3rd February, 1869. (Cf.
      <cite>Report of “The Mirza’s” Exploration from Caubul to Kashgar</cite>. By Major T.
      G. Montgomerie, R.E.... (<cite>Jour. R. Geog. Soc.</cite> XLI. 1871, pp. 132–192.)</p>

    <p>Major Montgomerie (<i>l.c.</i> p. 144) says: “The alterations in the positions of
      Kashgar and Yarkund in a great measure explains why Marco Polo, in crossing
      from Badakhshan to Eastern Turkestan, went first to Kashgar and then to
      Yarkund. With the old positions of Yarkund and Kashgar it appeared that the
      natural route from Badakhshan would have led first to Yarkund; with the
      new positions, and guided by the light of the Mirza’s route, from which it
      is seen that the direct route to Yarkund is not a good one, it is easy to
      understand how a traveller might prefer going to Kashgar first, and then
      to Yarkund. It is satisfactory to have elicited this further proof of the
      general accuracy of the great traveller’s account of his journey through
      Central Asia.”</p>

    <p>The Itinerary of Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon (<cite>Sirikol, the Pámírs and
      Wakhán</cite>, ch. vi. of <cite>Forsyth’s Mission to Yarkund in</cite> 1873) runs thus:
      “Left Káshgar (21st March), Yangi-Hissar, Kaskasú Pass, descent to Chihil
      Gumbaz (forty Domes), where the road branches off to Yárkand (110 miles),
      Torut Pass, Tangi-Tár (defile), ‘to the foot of a great elevated slope
      leading to the Chichiklik Pass, plain, and lake (14,700 feet), below the
      Yámbulák and Kok-Moinok Passes, which are used later in the season on the
      road between Yangi-Hissar and Sirikol, to avoid the Tangi-Tár and Shindi
      defiles. As the season advances, these passes become free from snow,
      while the defiles are rendered dangerous and difficult by the rush of the
      melting snow torrents. From the Chichiklik plain we proceeded down the
      Shindi ravine, over an extremely bad stony road, to the Sirikol River, up
      the banks of which we travelled to Táshkurgán, reaching it on the tenth
      day from Yangi-Hissar. The total distance is 125 miles.’ Then Táshkurgán
      (ancient name <em>Várshídi</em>): ‘the open part of the Sirikol Valley extends
      from about 8 miles below Táshkurgán to apparently a very considerable
      distance towards the Kunjút mountain range;’ left Táshkurgán for Wákhan
      (2nd April, 1873); leave Sirikol Valley, enter the Shindán defile, reach
      the Áktásh Valley, follow the Áktásh stream (called Áksú by the Kirghiz)
      through the Little Pamir to the Gházkul (Little Pamir) Lake or Barkat
      Yássín, from which it takes its rise, four days from Táshkurgán. Little
      Pamir ‘is bounded on the south by the continuation of the Neza Tásh range,
      which separates it from the Tághdúngbásh Pámir,’ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>west of the lake, Langar,
      Sarhadd, 30 miles from Langar, and seven days from Sirikol, and Kila Panj,
      twelve days from Sirikol.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[I cannot admit with Professor Paquier (<i>l.c.</i> pp. 127–128) that Marco Polo
      did not visit Kashgar.—Grenard (II. p. 17) makes the remark that it took
      Marco Polo seventy days from Badakhshan to Kashgar, a distance that, in the
      Plain of Turkestan, he shall cross in sixteen days.—The Chinese traveller,
      translated by M. Gueluy (<cite>Desc. de la Chine occidentale</cite>, p. 45), says that
      the name Kashgar is made of <em>Kash</em>, fine colour, and <em>gar</em>, brick house.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Kashgar was the capital, from 1865 to 1877, of Ya’kúb Kúshbegi, a
      soldier of fortune, by descent it is said a Tajik of Shighnan, who, when
      the Chinese yoke was thrown off, made a throne for himself in Eastern
      Turkestan, and subjected the whole basin to his authority, taking the title
      of <em>Atalik Gházi</em>.</p>

    <p>It is not easy to see how Kashgar should have been subject to the Great
      Kaan, except in the sense in which all territories under Mongol rule owed
      him homage. Yarkand, Polo acknowledges to have belonged to Kaidu, and the
      boundary between Kaidu’s territory and the Kaan’s lay between Karashahr and
      Komul [<a href="#CHAPTER_XLI1">Bk. I. ch. xli.</a>], much further east.</p>

    <p>[Bretschneider, <cite>Med. Res.</cite> (II. p. 47), says: “Marco Polo states with
      respect to the kingdom of <em>Cascar</em> (I. 189) that it was subject to the
      Great Khan, and says the same regarding <em>Cotan</em> (I. 196), whilst <cite>Yarcan</cite>
      (I. 195), according to Marco Polo, belonged to Kaidu. This does not agree
      with Rashid’s statements about the boundary between Kaidu’s territory and
      the Khan’s.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Kashgar was at this time a Metropolitan See of the Nestorian Church.
      (<cite>Cathay</cite>, etc. 275, ccxlv.)</p>

    <p>Many strange sayings have been unduly ascribed to our traveller, but
      I remember none stranger than this by Colonel Tod: “<em>Marco Polo calls
      Cashgar, where he was in the 6th century</em>, the birthplace of the Swedes”!
      (<cite>Rajasthan</cite>, I. 60.) Pétis de la Croix and Tod between them are answerable
      for this nonsense. (See <cite>The Hist. of Genghizcan the Great</cite>, p. 116.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Great City of Samarcan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Samarcan</span> is a great and noble city towards the north-west, inhabited by
    both Christians and Saracens, who are subject to the Great Kaan’s nephew,
    <span class="smcap">Caidou</span> by name; he is, however, at bitter enmity with the Kaan.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV11" href="#Note_XXXIV11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> I
    will tell you of a great marvel that happened at this city.</p>

  <div class="figcenter0 illowp100" id="i184">
    <img class="w100" src="images/i184.jpg" alt="" />
    <div class="caption">View of Samarcand. (From a sketch by Mr. Ivanoff.)</div>
  </div>
  <div class="captionc antiqua" lang="fr">“Samarcan est une grandisme cité et noble.”</div>

  <p>It is not a great while ago that <span class="smcap">Sigatay</span>, own brother to the Great
    Kaan, who was Lord of this country and of many an one besides, became a
    Christian.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV12" href="#Note_XXXIV12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>Christians rejoiced greatly at this, and they built
    a great church in the city, in honour of John the Baptist; and by his name
    the church was called. And they took a very fine stone which belonged to
    the Saracens, and placed it as the pedestal of a column in the middle of
    the church, supporting the roof. It came to pass, however, that Sigatay
    died. Now the Saracens were full of rancour about that stone that had been
    theirs, and which had been set up in the church of the Christians; and
    when they saw that the Prince was dead, they said one to another that now
    was the time to get back their stone, by fair means or by foul. And that
    they might well do, for they were ten times as many as the Christians. So
    they gat together and went to the church and said that the stone they must
    and would have. The Christians acknowledged that it was theirs indeed, but
    offered to pay a large sum of money and so be quit. Howbeit, the others
    replied that they never would give up the stone for anything in the world.
    And words ran so high that the Prince heard thereof, and ordered the
    Christians either to arrange to satisfy the Saracens, if it might be, with
    money, or to give up the stone. And he allowed them three days to do either
    the one thing or the other.</p>

  <p>What shall I tell you? Well, the Saracens would on no account agree
    to leave the stone where it was, and this out of pure despite to the
    Christians, for they knew well enough that if the stone were stirred the
    church would come down by the run. So the Christians were in great trouble
    and wist not what to do. But they did do the best thing possible; they
    besought Jesus Christ that he would consider their case, so that the holy
    church should not come to destruction, nor the name of its Patron Saint,
    John the Baptist, be tarnished by its ruin. And so when the day fixed by
    the Prince <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>came round, they went to the church betimes in the morning,
    and lo, they found the stone removed from under the column; the foot of
    the column was without support, and yet it bore the load as stoutly as
    before! Between the foot of the column and the ground there was a space of
    three palms. So the Saracens had away their stone, and mighty little joy
    withal. It was a glorious miracle, nay, it <em>is</em> so, for the column still so
    standeth, and will stand as long as God pleaseth.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV13" href="#Note_XXXIV13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>Now let us quit this and continue our journey.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXXIV11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIV11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Of Kaidu, Kúblái Kaan’s kinsman and rival, and their long wars, we
      shall have to speak later. He had at this time a kind of joint occupancy of
      <span class="smcap">Samarkand</span> and Bokhara with the Khans of Chagatai, his cousins.</p>

    <p>[On Samarkand generally see: <cite>Samarqand</cite>, by W. Radloff, translated into
      French by L. Leger, <i lang="fr">Rec. d’Itin. dans l’Asie Centrale</i>, École des Langues
      Orient., Paris, 1878, p. 284 et seq.; <cite>A travers le royaume de Tamerlan
      (Asie Centrale)</cite> ... par Guillaume Capus ... Paris, 1892, 8vo.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Marco evidently never was at Samarkand, though doubtless it was visited by
      his Father and Uncle on their first journey, when we know they were long at
      Bokhara. Having, therefore, little to say descriptive of a city he had not
      seen, he tells us a story:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“So geographers, in Afric maps,</div>
          <div class="i1">With savage pictures fill their gaps,</div>
          <div class="i1">And o’er unhabitable downs</div>
          <div class="i1">Place elephants for want of towns.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>As regards the Christians of Samarkand who figure in the preceding story,
      we may note that the city had been one of the Metropolitan Sees of the
      Nestorian Church since the beginning of the 8th century, and had been a
      bishopric perhaps two centuries earlier. Prince Sempad, High Constable
      of Armenia, in a letter written from Samarkand in 1246 or 1247, mentions
      several circumstances illustrative of the state of things indicated in this
      story: “I tell you that we have found many Christians scattered all over
      the East, and many fine churches, lofty, ancient, and of good architecture,
      which have been spoiled by the Turks. Hence, the Christians of this country
      came to the presence of the reigning Kaan’s grandfather (<i>i.e.</i> Chinghiz);
      he received them most honourably, and granted them liberty of worship, and
      issued orders to prevent their having any just cause of complaint by word
      or deed. <em>And so the Saracens, who used to treat them with contempt, have
      now the like treatment in double measure.</em>”</p>

    <p>Shortly after Marco’s time, viz. in 1328, Thomas of Mancasola, a Dominican,
      who had come from Samarkand with a Mission to the Pope (John XXII.) from
      Ilchigadai, Khan of Chagatai, was appointed Latin Bishop of that city.
      (<cite>Mosheim</cite>, p. 110, etc.; <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 192.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXIV12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIV12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—<span class="smcap">Chagatai</span>, here called Sigatay, was Uncle, not Brother, to the Great
      Kaan (Kúblái). Nor was Kaidu either Chagatai’s son or Kúblái’s nephew, as
      Marco here and elsewhere represents him to be. (See Bk. IV. ch. i.) The
      term used to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>describe Chagatai’s relationship is <i lang="fr">frère charnel</i>, which
      excludes ambiguity, cousinship, or the like (such as is expressed by the
      Italian <i lang="it">fratello cugíno</i>), and corresponds, I believe, to the <em>brother
      german</em> of Scotch law documents.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXIV13" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIV13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—One might say, These things be an allegory! We take the fine stone
      that belongs to the Saracens (or Papists) to build our church on, but the
      day of reckoning comes at last, and our (Irish Protestant) Christians are
      afraid that the Church will come about their ears. May it stand, and better
      than that of Samarkand has done!</p>

    <p>There is a story somewhat like this in D’Herbelot, about the Karmathian
      Heretics carrying off the Black Stone from Mecca, and being obliged years
      after to bring it back across the breadth of Arabia; on which occasion the
      stone conducted itself in a miraculous manner.</p>

    <p>There <em>is</em> a remarkable Stone at Samarkand, the <em>Kok-Tash</em> or Green Stone,
      on which Timur’s throne was set. Tradition says that, big as it is, it was
      brought by him from Brusa;—but tradition may be wrong. (See <cite>Vámbéry’s
      Travels</cite>, p. 206.) [Also <cite>H. Moser, A travers l’Asie centrale</cite>, 114–115.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[The Archimandrite Palladius (<cite>Chinese Recorder</cite>, VI. p. 108) quotes from
      the <cite>Chi shun Chin-kiang chi</cite> (Description of Chin-Kiang), 14th century,
      the following passage regarding the pillar: “There is a temple (in
      Samarcand) supported by four enormous wooden pillars, each of them 40 feet
      high. One of these pillars is in a hanging position, and stands off from
      the floor more than a foot.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Yarcan</span> is a province five days’ journey in extent. The people follow the
    Law of Mahommet, but there are also Nestorian and Jacobite Christians. They
    are subject to the same Prince that I mentioned, the Great Kaan’s nephew.
    They have plenty of everything, [particularly of cotton. The inhabitants
    are also great craftsmen, but a large proportion of them have swoln legs,
    and great crops at the throat, which arises from some quality in their
    drinking-water.] As there is nothing else worth telling we may pass

      to this day, though we write <span class="smcap">Yarkand</span>.</p>

    <p>[A Chinese traveller, translated by M. Gueluy (<cite>Desc. de la Chine
      occidentale</cite>, p. 41), says that the word <em>Yarkand</em> is made of <em>Iar</em>,
      earth, and <em>Kiang</em> (<em>Kand?</em>), large, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>vast, but this derivation is doubtful.
      The more probable one is that Yarkand is made up of <em>Yar</em>, new, and <em>Kand,
      Kend</em>, or <em>Kent</em>, city.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Mir ’Izzat Ullah in modern days speaks of the prevalence of goitre at
      Yarkand. And Mr. Shaw informs me that during his recent visit to Yarkand
      (1869) he had numerous applications for iodine as a remedy for that
      disease. The theory which connects it with the close atmosphere of valleys
      will not hold at Yarkand. (<cite>J. R. A. S.</cite> VII. 303.)</p>

    <p>[Dr. Sven Hedin says that three-fourths of the population of Yarkand are
      suffering from goitre; he ascribes the prevalence of the disease to the bad
      quality of the water, which is kept in large basins, used indifferently for
      bathing, washing, or draining. Only Hindu and “Andijdanlik” merchants, who
      drink well water, are free from goitre.</p>

    <p>Lieutenant Roborovsky, the companion of Pievtsov, in 1889, says: “In
      the streets one meets many men and women with large goitres, a malady
      attributed to the bad quality of the water running in the town conduits,
      and drunk by the inhabitants in its natural state. It appears in men at the
      age of puberty, and in women when they marry.” (<cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> 2 ser.
      XII. 1890, p. 36.)</p>

    <p>Formerly the Mirza (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> 1871, p. 181) said: “Goitre is very
      common in the city [of Yarkund], and in the country round, but it is
      unknown in Kashgar.”</p>

    <p>General Pievtsov gives to the small oasis of Yarkand (264 square miles) a
      population of 150,000, that is, 567 inhabitants per square mile. He, after
      Prjevalsky’s death, started, with V. L. Roborovsky (botanist) and P. K.
      Kozlov (zoologist), who were later joined by K. I. Bogdanovich (geologist),
      on his expedition to Tibet (1889–1890). He followed the route Yarkand,
      Khotan, Kiria, Nia, and Charchan.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>And this notion gave rise to the use of <em>Mawmet</em> for an idol in general;
      whilst from the <em>Mahommerie</em> or place of Islamite worship the name of
      <em>mummery</em> came to be applied to idolatrous or unmeaning rituals; both very

      to agriculture, and produces everything abundantly. From this country are
      got woollen carpets, fine felts, well woven taffetas, white and black
      jade.” Chinese authors of the 10th century speak of the abundant grapes and
      excellent wine of Khotan.</p>

    <p>Chinese annals of the 7th and 8th centuries tell us that the people of
      Khotan had chronicles of their own, a glimpse of a lost branch of history.
      Their writing, laws, and literature were modelled upon those of India.</p>

    <p>Ilchi, the modern capital, was visited by Mr. Johnson, of the Indian
      Survey, in 1865. The country, after the revolt against the Chinese in 1863,
      came first under the rule of Habíb-ullah, an aged chief calling himself
      <em>Khán Bádshah</em> of Khotan; and since the treacherous seizure and murder of
      Habíb-ullah by Ya’kub Beg of Kashgar in January 1867, it has formed a part
      of the kingdom of the latter.</p>

    <p>Mr. Johnson says: “The chief grains of the country are Indian corn, wheat,
      barley of two kinds, <em>bájra, jowár</em> (two kinds of <em>holcus</em>), buckwheat and
      rice, all of which are superior to the Indian grains, and are of a very
      fine quality.... The country is certainly superior to India, and in every
      respect equal to Kashmir, over which it has the advantage of being less
      humid, and consequently better suited to the growth of fruits. <em>Olives</em>
      (?), pears, apples, peaches, apricots, mulberries, grapes, currants, and
      melons, all exceedingly large in size and of a delicious flavour, are
      produced in great variety and abundance.... Cotton of valuable quality, and
      raw silk, are produced in very large quantities.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>

    <p>[Khotan is the chief place of Turkestan for cotton manufactures; its
      <em>khàm</em> is to be found everywhere. This name, which means raw in Persian,
      is given to a stuff made with cotton thread, which has not undergone any
      preparation; they manufacture also two other cotton stuffs: <em>alatcha</em> with
      blue and red stripes, and <em>tchekmen</em>, very thick and coarse, used to make
      dresses and sacks; if <em>khàm</em> is better at Khotan, <em>alatcha</em> and <em>tchekmen</em>
      are superior at Kashgar. (<cite>Grenard</cite>, II. pp. 191–192.)</p>

    <p>Grenard (II. pp. 175–177), among the fruits, mentions apricots (<em>ourouk</em>),
      ripe in June, and so plentiful that to keep them they are dried up to be
      used like garlic against mountain sickness; melons (<em>koghoun</em>); water-melons
      (<em>tarbouz</em>, the best are from Hami); vine (<em>tâl</em>)—the best grapes (<em>uzum</em>)
      come from Boghâz langar, near Keria; the best dried grapes are those from
      Turfan; peaches (<em>shaptâlou</em>); pomegranates (<em>anár</em>, best from Kerghalyk),
      etc.; the best apples are those of Nia and Sadju; pears are very bad;
      cherries and strawberries are unknown. Grenard (II. p. 106) also says that
      grapes are very good, but that Khotan wine is detestable, and tastes like vinegar.</p>

    <p>The Chinese traveller, translated by M. Gueluy (<cite>Desc. de la Chine
      occidentale</cite>, p. 45), says that all the inhabitants of Khotan are seeking
      for precious stones, and that melons and fruits are more plentiful than at
      Yarkand.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Mr. Johnson reports the whole country to be rich in soil and very much
      under-peopled. Ilchi, the capital, has a population of about 40,000, and
      is a great place for manufactures. The chief articles produced are silks,
      felts, carpets (both silk and woollen), coarse cotton cloths, and paper
      from the mulberry fibre. The people are strict Mahomedans, and speak a
      Turki dialect. Both sexes are good-looking, with a slightly Tartar cast of
      countenance. (<cite>V. et V. de H. T.</cite> 278; <cite>Rémusat, H. de la V. de Khotan</cite>,
      37, 73–84; <cite>Chin. Repos.</cite> IX. 128; <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXXVII. 6 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>

    <p>[In 1891, Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard at the small village of Yotkàn,
      about 8 miles to the west of the present Khotan, came across what they
      considered the most important and probably the most ancient city of
      southern Chinese Turkestan. The natives say that Yotkàn is the site of the
      old Capital. (Cf. <cite>Grenard</cite>, III. p. 127 <i>et seq.</i> for a description and
      drawings of coins and objects found at this place.)</p>

    <p>The remains of the ancient capital of Khotan were accidentally discovered,
      some thirty-five years ago, at Yotkàn, a village of the Borazân Tract. A
      great mass of highly interesting finds of ancient art pottery, engraved
      stones, and early Khotan coins with Kharoṣṭhi-Chinese legends, coming from
      this site, have recently been thoroughly examined in Dr. Hoernle’s Report
      on the “British Collection of Central Asian Antiquities.” <cite>Stein</cite>.—(See
      <cite>Three further Collections of Ancient Manuscripts from Central Asia</cite>, by
      Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle ... Calcutta, 1897, 8vo.)</p>

    <p>“The sacred sites of Buddhist Khotan which Hiuen Tsang and Fa-hian
      describe, can be shown to be occupied now, almost without exception, by
      Mohamedan shrines forming the object of popular pilgrimages.” (M. A. Stein,
      <cite>Archæological Work about Khotan, Jour. R. As. Soc.</cite>, April, 1901, p. 296.)</p>

    <p>It may be justly said that during the last few years numerous traces of
      Hindu civilisation have been found in Central Asia, extending from Khotan,
      through the Takla-Makan, as far as Turfan, and perhaps further up.</p>

    <p>Dr. Sven Hedin, in the year 1896, during his second journey through
      Takla-Makan from Khotan to Shah Yar, visited the ruins between the Khotan
      Daria and the Kiria Daria, where he found the remains of the city of
      Takla-Makan now buried in the sands. He discovered figures of Buddha, a
      piece of papyrus with unknown characters, vestiges of habitations. This
      Asiatic Pompei, says the traveller, at least ten centuries old, is anterior
      to the Mahomedan invasion led by Kuteïbe Ibn-Muslim, which happened at the
      beginning of the 8th century. Its inhabitants were Buddhist, and of Aryan
      race, probably originating from Hindustan.—Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard
      discovered in the Kumâri grottoes, in a small hill on the right bank of
      the Karakash Daria, a manuscript written on birch bark in <em>K</em>harosḥ<em>t</em>hi
      characters; these grottoes of Kumâri are mentioned in Hiuen Tsang. (II. p. 229.)</p>

    <p>Dr. Sven Hedin followed the route Kashgar, Yangi-Hissar, Yarkand to Khotan,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>in 1895. He made a stay of nine days at Ilchi, the population of which he
      estimated at 5500 inhabitants (5000 Musulmans, 500 Chinese).</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Province of Pein.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Pein</span> is a province five days in length, lying between east and north-east.
    The people are worshippers of Mahommet, and subjects of the Great Kaan.
    There are a good number of towns and villages, but the most noble is <span class="smcap">Pein</span>,
    the capital of the kingdom.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXVII11" href="#Note_XXXVII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> There are rivers in this country, in
    which quantities of Jasper and Chalcedony are found.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXVII12" href="#Note_XXXVII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> The people
    have plenty of all products, including cotton. They live by manufactures
    and trade. But they have a custom that I must relate. If the husband of any
    woman go away upon a journey and remain away for more than 20 days, as soon
    as that term is past the woman may marry another man, and the husband also
    may then marry whom he pleases.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXVII13" href="#Note_XXXVII13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>I should tell you that all the provinces that I have been speaking of, from
    Cascar forward, and those I am going to mention [as far as the city of Lop]
    belong to <span class="smcap">Great Turkey</span>.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXXVII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXVII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      1.</a>—“In old times,” says the <cite>Haft Iklím.</cite>, “travellers used to go from
      Khotan to Cathay in 14 (?) days, and found towns and villages all along the
      road [excepting, it may be presumed, on the terrible Gobi], so that there
      was no need to travel in caravans. In later days the fear of the Kalmaks
      caused this line to be abandoned, and the circuitous one occupied 100
      days.” This directer route between Khotan and China must have been followed
      by Fa-hian on his way to India; by Hiuen Tsang on his way back; and by Shah
      Rukh’s ambassadors on their return from China in 1421. The circuitous route
      alluded to appears to have gone north from Khotan, crossed the Tarimgol,
      and fallen into the road along the base of the Thian Shan, eventually
      crossing the Desert southward from Komul.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

    <p>Former commentators differed very widely as to the position of Pein, and
      as to the direction of Polo’s route from Khotan. The information acquired
      of late years leaves the latter no longer open to doubt. It must have been
      nearly coincident with that of Hiuen Tsang.</p>

    <p>The perusal of Johnson’s Report of his journey to Khotan, and the
      Itineraries attached to it, enabled me to feel tolerable certainty as to
      the position of Charchan (see next chapter), and as to the fact that Marco
      followed a direct route from Khotan to the vicinity of Lake Lop. Pein,
      then, was identical with <span class="smcap">Pima</span>,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which was the first city reached by Hiuen
      Tsang on his return to China after quitting Khotan, and which lay 330 <i>li</i>
      east of the latter city.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Other notices of Pima appear in Rémusat’s
      history of Khotan; some of these agree exactly as to the distance from the
      capital, adding that it stood on the banks of a river flowing from the East
      and entering the sandy Desert; whilst one account seems to place it at
      500 <i>li</i> from Khotan. And in the Turkish map of Central Asia, printed in
      the <cite>Jahán Numá</cite>, as we learn from Sir H. Rawlinson, the town of <em>Pím</em> is
      placed a little way north of Khotan. Johnson found Khotan rife with stories
      of former cities overwhelmed by the shifting sands of the Desert, and these
      sands appear to have been advancing for ages; for far to the north-east of
      Pima, even in the 7th century, were to be found the deserted and ruined
      cities of the ancient kingdoms of <em>Tuholo</em> and <em>Shemathona</em>. “Where
      anciently were the seats of flourishing cities and prosperous communities,”
      says a Chinese author speaking of this region, “is nothing now to be seen
      but a vast desert; all has been buried in the sands, and the wild camel is
      hunted on those arid plains.”</p>

    <p>Pima cannot have been very far from <em>Kiria</em>, visited by Johnson. This is
      a town of 7000 houses, lying east of Ilchi, and about 69 miles distant
      from it. The road for the most part lies through a highly cultivated and
      irrigated country, flanked by the sandy desert at three or four miles to
      the left. After passing <em>eastward</em> by Kiria it is said to make a great
      elbow, turning north; and within this elbow lie the sands that have buried
      cities and fertile country. Here Mr. Shaw supposes Pima lay (perhaps upon
      the river of Kiria). At Pima itself, in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 644, there was a story of the
      destruction of a city lying further north, a judgment on the luxury and
      impiety of the people and their king, who, shocked at the eccentric aspect
      of a holy man, had caused him to be buried in sand up to the mouth.</p>

    <p>(<cite>N. et E.</cite> XIV. 477; <cite>H. de la Ville de Khotan</cite>, 63–66; <cite>Klap. Tabl.
      Historiques</cite>, p. 182; <cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> XVI. 243.)</p>

    <p>[Dutreuil de Rhins and Grenard took the road from Khotan to Charchan; they
      left Khotan on the 4th May, 1893, passed Kiria, Nia, and instead of going
      direct to Charchan through the desert, they passed Kara Say at the foot of
      the Altyn tâgh, a route three days longer than the other, but one which
      was less warm, and where water, meat, milk, and barley could be found.
      Having passed Kapa, they crossed the Karamuren, and went up from Achan
      due north to Charchan, where they stayed three months. Nowhere do they
      mention Pein, or Pima, for it appears to be <em>Kiria itself</em>, which is the
      only real town between Khotan and the Lobnor. Grenard says in a note (p.
      54, vol. ii.): “<em>Pi-mo</em> (Keria) recalls the Tibetan <em>byé-ma</em>, which is
      pronounced <em>Péma</em>, or <em>Tchéma</em>, and which means <em>sand</em>. Such is perhaps
      also the origin of <em>Pialma</em>, a village near Khotan, and of the old name of
      Charchan, <em>Tché-mo-to-na</em>, of which the two last syllables would represent
      <em>grong</em> (pronounce <em>tong</em> = town), or <em>kr’om</em> (<em>t’om</em> = bazaar). Now, not
      only would this etymology be justified because these three places are
      indeed surrounded with sand remarkably deep, but as they were the first
      three important places with which the Tibetans met coming into the desert
      of Gobi, either by the route of Gurgutluk and of Polor, or by Karakoram
      and Sandju, or by Tsadam, and they had thus as good a pretext to call
      them ‘towns of sand’ as the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>Chinese had to give to T’un-hwang the name of
      <em>Shachau</em>, viz. City of Sand. Kiria is called <em>Ou-mi</em>, under the Han, and
      the name of Pi-mo is found for the first time in Hiuen Tsang, that is to
      say, before the Tibetan invasions of the 8th century. It is not possible to
      admit that the incursion of the Tu-ku-hun in the 5th century could be the
      cause of this change of name. The hypothesis remains that Pi-mo was really
      the ancient name forced by the first Tibetan invaders spoken of by legend,
      that <em>Ou-mi</em> was either another name of the town, or a fancy name invented
      by the Chinese, like Yu-t’ien for Khotan, Su-lo for Kashgar....” Sir T. D.
      Forsyth (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite>, XLVII., 1877, p. 3) writes: “I should say that Peim
      or Pima must be identical with Kiria.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXVII12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXVII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—The Jasper and Chalcedony of our author are probably only varieties
      of the semi-precious mineral called by us popularly <em>Jade</em>, by the Chinese
      <em>Yü</em>, by the Eastern Turks <em>Kásh</em>, by the Persians <em>Yashm</em>, which last is
      no doubt the same word with <span lang="el">ἴασπις</span>, and therefore with <em>Jasper</em>.
      The Greek Jaspis was in reality, according to Mr. King, a green Chalcedony.</p>

    <p>The Jade of Turkestan is largely derived from water-rolled boulders fished
      up by divers in the rivers of Khotan, but it is also got from mines in the
      valley of the Karákásh River. “Some of the Jade,” says Timkowski, “is as
      white as snow, some dark green, like the most beautiful emerald (?), others
      yellow, vermilion, and jet black. The rarest and most esteemed varieties
      are the white speckled with red and the green veined with gold.” (I. 395.)
      The Jade of Khotan appears to be first mentioned by Chinese authors in the
      time of the Han Dynasty under Wu-ti (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 140–86). In <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 541 an image
      of Buddha sculptured in Jade was sent as an offering from Khotan; and in
      632 the process of fishing for the material in the rivers of Khotan, as
      practised down to modern times, is mentioned. The importation of Jade or
      <em>Yü</em> from this quarter probably gave the name of <em>Kia-yü Kwan</em> or “Jade
      Gate” to the fortified Pass looking in this direction on the extreme N.W.
      of China Proper, between Shachau and Suhchau. Since the detachment from
      China the Jade industry has ceased, the Musulmans having no taste for that
      kind of <em>virtù</em>. (<cite>H. de la V. de Khotan</cite>, 2, 17, 23; also see <cite>J. R. G.
      S.</cite> XXXVI. 165, and <cite>Cathay</cite>, 130, 564; <cite>Ritter</cite>, II. 213; <cite>Shaw’s High
      Tartary</cite>, pp. 98, 473.)</p>

    <p>[On the 11th January, 1895, Dr. Sven Hedin visited one of the chief places
      where Jade is to be found. It is to the north-east of Khotan, in the old
      bed of the Yurun Kash. The bed of the river is divided into <em>claims</em> like
      gold-fields; the workmen are Chinese for the greater part, some few are
      Musulmans.</p>

    <p>Grenard (II. pp. 186–187) says that the finest Jade comes from the high
      Karákásh (black Jade) River and Yurungkásh (white Jade); the Jade River
      is called Su-tásh. At Khotan, Jade is polished up by sixty or seventy
      individuals belonging to twenty-five workshops.</p>

    <p>“At 18 miles from Su-chau, Kia-yu-kwan, celebrated as one of the gates of
      China, and as the fortress guarding the extreme north-west entrance into
      the empire, is passed.” (<cite>Colonel M. S. Bell, Proc. R. G. S.</cite> XII. 1890, p. 75.)</p>

    <p>According to the Chinese characters, the name of Kia-yü Kwan does not mean
      “Jade Gate,” and as Mr. Rockhill writes to me, it can only mean something
      like “barrier of the pleasant Valley.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXVII13" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXVII13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Possibly this may refer to the custom of temporary marriages which
      seems to prevail in most towns of Central Asia which are the halting-places
      of caravans, and the morals of which are much on a par with those of
      seaport towns, from analogous causes. Thus at Meshid, Khanikoff speaks of
      the large population of young and pretty women ready, according to the
      accommodating rules of Shiah Mahomedanism, to engage in marriages which are
      perfectly lawful, for a month, a week, or even twenty-four hours. Kashgar
      is also noted in the East for its <em>chaukans</em>, young women with whom the
      traveller may readily form an alliance for the period of his stay, be it
      long or short. (<cite>Khan. Mém.</cite> p. 98; <cite>Russ. in Central Asia</cite>, 52; <cite>J. A. S.

  <div class="subh4">Of the Province of Charchan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Charchan</span> is a Province of Great Turkey, lying between north-east and east.
    The people worship Mahommet. There are numerous towns and villages, and the
    chief city of the kingdom bears its name, Charchan. The Province contains
    rivers which bring down Jasper and Chalcedony, and these are carried for
    sale into Cathay, where they fetch great prices. The whole of the Province
    is sandy, and so is the road all the way from Pein, and much of the water
    that you find is bitter and bad. However, at some places you do find fresh
    and sweet water. When an army passes through the land, the people escape
    with their wives, children, and cattle a distance of two or three days’
    journey into the sandy waste; and knowing the spots where water is to be
    had, they are able to live there, and to keep their cattle alive, whilst
    it is impossible to discover them; for the wind immediately blows the sand
    over their track.</p>

  <p>Quitting Charchan, you ride some five days through the sands, finding none
    but bad and bitter water, and then you come to a place where the water is
    sweet. And now I will tell you of a province called Lop, in which there is
    a city, also called <span class="smcap">Lop</span>, which you come to at the end of those five days.
    It is at the entrance of the great Desert, and it is here that travellers
    repose before entering on the Desert.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXVIII11" href="#Note_XXXVIII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXXVIII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXVIII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Though the <em>Lake</em> of Lob or Lop appears on all our maps, from
      Chinese authority, the latter does not seem to have supplied information
      as to a town so called. We have, however, indications of the existence
      of such a place, both mediæval and recent. The History of Mirza Haidar,
      called the Táríkh-i-Rashídí, already referred to, in describing the Great
      Basin of Eastern Turkestan, says: “Formerly there were several large cities
      in this plain; the names of two have survived—<em>Lob</em> and <em>Kank</em>, but of
      the rest there is no trace or tradition; all is buried under the sand.”
      [Forsyth (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XLVII. 1877, p. 5) says that he thinks <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>that this
      Kank is probably the Katak mentioned by Mirza Haidar.—H.&nbsp;C.] In another
      place the same history says that a boy heir of the house of Chaghatai, to
      save him from a usurper, was sent away to Sárígh Uighúr and <em>Lob-Kank</em>,
      far in the East. Again, in the short notices of the cities of Turkestan
      which Mr. Wathen collected at Bombay from pilgrims of those regions on
      their way to Mecca, we find the following: “<em>Lopp</em>.—Lopp is situated at a
      great distance from Yarkand. The inhabitants are principally Chinese; but
      a few Uzbeks reside there. Lopp is remarkable for a salt-water lake in its
      vicinity.” Johnson, speaking of a road from Tibet into Khotan, says: “This
      route ... leads not only to Ilchi and Yarkand, but also <i>viâ</i> <em>Lob</em> to the
      large and important city of Karashahr.” And among the routes attached to
      Mr. Johnson’s original Report, we have:—</p>

    <p>“Route No. VII. <em>Kiria</em> (see note 1 to last chapter) to <span class="smcap">Chachan</span> and <span class="smcap">Lob</span>
      (<em>from native information</em>).”</p>

    <p>This first revealed to me the continued existence of Marco’s Charchan; for
      it was impossible to doubt that in the <span class="smcap">Chachan</span> and <span class="smcap">Lob</span> of this Itinerary we
      had his Charchan and Lop; and his route to the verge of the Great Desert
      was thus made clear.</p>

    <p>Mr. Johnson’s information made the journey from Kiria to Charchan to be
      9 marches, estimated by him to amount to 154 miles, and adding 69 miles
      from Ilchi to Kiria (which he actually traversed) we have 13 marches or
      223 miles for the distance from Ilchi to Charchan. Mr. Shaw has since
      obtained a route between Ilchi and Lob on very good authority. This makes
      the distance to Charchan, or <em>Charchand</em>, as it is called, 22 marches,
      which Mr. Shaw estimates at 293 miles. Both give 6 marches from Charchand
      to Lob, which is in fair accordance with Polo’s 5, and Shaw estimates the
      whole distance from Ilchi to Lob at 373, or by another calculation at 384
      miles, say roundly 380 miles. This higher estimate is to be preferred to
      Mr. Johnson’s for a reason which will appear under next chapter.</p>

    <p>Mr. Shaw’s informant, Rozi of Khotan, who had lived twelve years at
      Charchand, described the latter as a small town with a district extending
      on both sides of a stream which flows to Lob, <em>and which affords Jade</em>.
      The people are Musulmans. They grow wheat, Indian corn, pears, and apples,
      etc., but no cotton or rice. It stands in a great plain, but the mountains
      are not far off. The nature of the products leads Mr. Shaw to think it must
      stand a good deal higher than Ilchi (4000), perhaps at about 6000 feet. I
      may observe that the Chinese hydrography of the Kashgar Basin, translated
      by Julien in the <cite>N. An. des Voyages</cite> for 1846 (vol. iii.), seems to imply
      that mountains from the south approach within some 20 miles of the Tarim
      River, between the longitude of Shayar and Lake Lop. The people of Lob are
      Musulman also, but very uncivilised. The Lake is salt. The hydrography
      calls it about 200 <i>li</i> (say 66 miles) from E. to W. and half that from N.
      to S., and expresses the old belief that it forms the subterranean source
      of the Hwang-Ho. Shaw’s Itinerary shows “salt pools” at six of the stations
      between Kiria and Charchand, so Marco’s memory in this also was exact.</p>

    <p><em>Nia</em>, a town two marches from Kiria according to Johnson, or four
      according to Shaw, is probably the ancient city of Ni-jang of the ancient
      Chinese Itineraries, which lay 30 or 40 miles on the China side of Pima,
      in the middle of a great marsh, and formed the eastern frontier of Khotan
      bordering on the Desert. (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXXVII. pp. 13 and 44; also Sir H.
      Rawlinson in XLII. p. 503; <cite>Erskine’s Baber and Humayun</cite>, I. 42; <cite>Proc.
      R. G. S.</cite> vol. xvi. pp. 244–249; <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite> IV. 656; <cite>H. de la V. de
      Khotan</cite>, u.s.)</p>

    <p>[The Charchan of Marco Polo seems to have been built to the west of the
      present oasis, a little south of the road to Kiria, where ruined houses
      have been found. It must have been destroyed before the 16th century, since
      Mirza Haidar does not mention it. It was not anterior to the 7th century,
      as it did not exist at the time of Hiuen Tsang. (Cf. <cite>Grenard</cite>, III. p. 146.)</p>

    <p>Grenard says (pp. 183–184) that he examined the remains of what is called
      the old town of Charchan, traces of the ancient canal, ruins of dwellings
      deep into the sand, of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>which the walls built of large and solid-baked
      bricks, are pretty well preserved. Save these bricks, “I found hardly
      anything, the inhabitants have pillaged everything long ago. I attempted
      some excavating, which turned out to be without result, as far as I was
      concerned; but the superstitious natives declared that they were the cause
      of a violent storm which took place soon after. There are similar ruins in
      the environs, at Yantak Koudouk, at Tatrang, one day’s march to the north,
      and at Ouadjchahari at five days to the north-east, which corresponds to
      the position assigned to Lop by Marco Polo.” (See <cite>Grenard’s Haute Asie</cite> on
      <em>Nia</em>.)</p>

    <p>Palladius is quite mistaken (<i>l.c.</i> p. 3) in saying that the “Charchan” of
      Marco Polo is to be found in the present province of Karashar. (Cf. <cite>T. W.

  <div class="subh4">Of the City of Lop and the Great Desert.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Lop</span> is a large town at the edge of the Desert, which is called the Desert
    of Lop, and is situated between east and north-east. It belongs to the
    Great Kaan, and the people worship Mahommet. Now, such persons as propose
    to cross the Desert take a week’s rest in this town to refresh themselves
    and their cattle; and then they make ready for the journey, taking with
    them a month’s supply for man and beast. On quitting this city they enter
    the Desert.</p>

  <p>The length of this Desert is so great that ’tis said it would take a year
    and more to ride from one end of it to the other. And here, where its
    breadth is least, it takes a month to cross it. ’Tis all composed of hills
    and valleys of sand, and not a thing to eat is to be found on it. But
    after riding for a day and a night you find fresh water, enough mayhap for
    some 50 or 100 persons with their beasts, but not for more. And all across
    the Desert you will find water in like manner, that is to say, in some 28
    places altogether you will find good water, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>but in no great quantity; and
    in four places also you find brackish water.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIX11" href="#Note_XXXIX11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>Beasts there are none; for there is nought for them to eat. But there is
    a marvellous thing related of this Desert, which is that when travellers
    are on the move by night, and one of them chances to lag behind or to
    fall asleep or the like, when he tries to gain his company again he will
    hear spirits talking, and will suppose them to be his comrades. Sometimes
    the spirits will call him by name; and thus shall a traveller ofttimes be
    led astray so that he never finds his party. And in this way many have
    perished. [Sometimes the stray travellers will hear as it were the tramp
    and hum of a great cavalcade of people away from the real line of road, and
    taking this to be their own company they will follow the sound; and when
    day breaks they find that a cheat has been put on them and that they are
    in an ill plight.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIX12" href="#Note_XXXIX12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>] Even in the day-time one hears those spirits
    talking. And sometimes you shall hear the sound of a variety of musical
    instruments, and still more commonly the sound of drums. [Hence in making
    this journey ’tis customary for travellers to keep close together. All
    the animals too have bells at their necks, so that they cannot easily get
    astray. And at sleeping-time a signal is put up to show the direction of
    the next march.]</p>

  <p>So thus it is that the Desert is crossed.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIX13" href="#Note_XXXIX13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

      1.</a>—<span class="smcap">Lop</span> appears to be the <em>Napopo</em>, <i>i.e.</i> <em>Navapa</em>, of Hiuen Tsang, called
      also the country of <em>Leulan</em>, in the Desert. (<i>Mém.</i> II. p. 247.) <em>Navapa</em>
      looks like Sanskrit. If so, this carries ancient Indian influence to the
      verge of the great Gobi. [See <i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_190">p. 190</a>.] It is difficult to reconcile
      with our maps the statement of a thirty days’ journey across the Desert
      from Lop to Shachau. Ritter’s extracts, indeed, regarding this Desert, show
      that the constant occurrence of sandhills and deep drifts (our traveller’s
      “hills and valleys of sand”) makes the passage extremely difficult for
      carts and cattle. (III. 375.) But I suspect that there is some material
      error in the longitude of Lake Lop as represented in our maps, and that it
      should be placed <em>something like three degrees</em> more to the westward than
      we find it (<i>e.g.</i>) in Kiepert’s Map of Asia. By that map Khotan is not far
      short of 600 miles from the western extremity of Lake Lop. By <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>Johnson’s
      Itinerary (including his own journey to Kiria) it is only 338 miles from
      Ilchi to Lob. Mr. Shaw, as we have seen, gives us a little more, but it is
      only even then 380. Polo unfortunately omits his usual estimate for the
      extent of the “Province of Charchan,” so he affords us no complete datum.
      But his distance between Charchan and Lob agrees fairly, as we have seen,
      with that both of Johnson and of Shaw, and the elbow on the road from Kiria
      to Charchan (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_192">p. 192</a>) necessitates our still further abridging the
      longitude between Khotan and Lop. (See Shaw’s remarks in <cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> XVI. 243.)</p>

    <p>[This desert was known in China of old by the name of <em>Lew-sha</em>, <i>i.e.</i>
      “Quicksand,” or literally, “Flowing sands.” (<cite>Palladius, Jour. N. China B.
      R. As. Soc.</cite> N.S. X. 1875, p. 4.)</p>

    <p>A most interesting problem is connected with the situation of Lob-nor which
      led to some controversy between Baron von Richthofen and Prjevalsky. The
      latter placed the lake one degree more to the south than the Chinese did,
      and found that its water was sweet. Richthofen agreed with the Chinese
      Topographers and wrote in a letter to Sir Henry Yule: “I send you two
      tracings; one of them is a true copy of the Chinese map, the other is made
      from a sketch which I constructed to-day, and on which I tried to put
      down the Chinese Topography together with that of Prjevalsky. It appears
      evident—(1) That Prjevalsky travelled by the ancient road to a point south
      of the true Lop-noor; (2) that long before he reached this point he found
      the river courses quite different from what they had been formerly; and (3)
      that following one of the new rivers which flows due south by a new road,
      he reached the two sweet-water lakes, one of which answers to the ancient
      Khas-omo. I use the word ‘new’ merely by way of comparison with the state
      of things in Kien-long’s time, when the map was made. It appears that the
      Chinese map shows the Khas Lake too far north to cover the Kara-Koshun.
      The bifurcation of the roads south of the lake nearly resembles that which
      is marked by Prjevalsky.” (Preface of E. D. Morgan’s transl. of <cite>From
      Kulja across the Tian Shan to Lob-nor</cite>, by Colonel N. Prjevalsky, London,
      1879, p. iv.) In this same volume Baron von Richthofen’s remarks are given
      (pp. 135–159, with a map, p. 144), showing comparison between Chinese and
      Prjevalsky’s Geography from tracings by Baron von Richthofen and (pp.
      160–165) a translation of Prjevalsky’s replies to the Baron’s criticisms.</p>

    <p>Now the Swedish traveller, Dr. Sven Hedin, claims to have settled this
      knotty point. Going from Korla, south-west of Kara-shahr, by a road at the
      foot of the Kurugh-tagh and between these mountains and the Koncheh Daria,
      he discovered the ruins of two fortresses, and a series of milestones
      (potaïs). These tall pyramids of clay and wood, indicating distances in
      <i>lis</i>, show the existence at an ancient period of a road with a large
      traffic between Korla and an unknown place to the south-east, probably on
      the shores of the Chinese Lob-nor. Prjevalsky, who passed between the Lower
      Tarim and the Koncheh Daria, could not see a lake or the remains of a lake
      to the east of this river. The Koncheh Daria expands into a marshy basin,
      the Malta Kul, from which it divides into two branches, the Kuntiekkich
      Tarim (East River) and the Ilek (river) to the E.S.E. Dr. Sven Hedin, after
      following the course of the Ilek for three days (4th April, 1896) found a
      large sheet of water in the valley at the very place marked by the Chinese
      Topographers and Richthofen for the Lob-nor. This mass of water is divided
      up by the natives into Avullu Kul, Kara Kul, Tayek Kul, and Arka Kul,
      which are actually almost filled up with reeds. Dr. Sven Hedin afterwards
      visited the Lob-nor of Prjevalsky, and reached its western extremity, the
      Kara-buran (black storm) on the 17th April. In 1885, Prjevalsky had found
      the Lob-nor an immense lake; four years later Prince Henri d’Orléans saw it
      greatly reduced in size, and Dr. Sven Hedin discovered but pools of water.
      In the meantime, since 1885, the northern (Chinese) Lob-nor has gradually
      filled up, so the lake is somewhat vagrant. Dr. Sven Hedin says that
      from his observations he can assert that Prjevalsky’s lake is of recent formation.</p>

    <p>So Marco Polo’s Lob-nor should be the northern or Chinese lake.</p>

    <p>Another proof of this given by Dr. Sven Hedin is that the Chinese give
      the name of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>Lob to the region between Arghan and Tikkenlik, unknown in
      the country of the southern lake. The existence of two lakes shows what
      a quantity of water from the Thian Shan, the Eastern Pamir, and Northern
      Tibet flows into the basin of the Tarim. The Russian Lieutenant K. P.
      Kozlov has tried since to prove that the Chinese Lob-nor is the Kara-Koshun
      (Black district), which is a second lake formed by the Tarim, which
      discharges into and issues from the lake Kara-buran. Kozlov’s arguments are
      published in the <cite>Isvestia</cite> of the Russian Geographical Society, and in a
      separate pamphlet. <cite>The Geog. Jour.</cite> (June, 1898, pp. 652–658) contains
      <cite>The Lob-nor Controversy</cite>, a full statement of the case, summarising
      Kozlov’s pamphlet. Among the documents relating to the controversy, Kozlov
      “quotes passages from the Chinese work <cite>Si-yui-shui-dao-tsi</cite>, published in
      1823, relative to the region, and gives a reduced copy of the Chinese Map
      published by Dr. Georg Wegener in 1863, upon which map Richthofen and Sven
      Hedin based their arguments.” Kozlov’s final conclusions (<cite>Geog. Jour.</cite>
      <i>l.c.</i> pp. 657–658) are the following: “The Koncheh-daria, since very remote
      times till the present day, has moved a long way. The spot Gherelgan may
      be taken as a spot of relative permanence of its bed, while the basis of
      its delta is a line traced from the farthest northern border of the area
      of salt clays surrounding the Lob-nor to the Tarim. At a later period the
      Koncheh-daria mostly influenced the lower Tarim, and each time a change
      occurred in the latter’s discharge, the Koncheh took a more westward
      course, to the detriment of its old eastern branch (Ilek). Always following
      the gradually receding humidity, the vegetable life changed too, while
      moving sands were taking its place, conquering more and more ground for the
      desert, and marking their conquest by remains of old shore-lines....</p>

    <p>“The facts noticed by Sven Hedin have thus another meaning—the desert to
      the east of the lakes, which he discovered, was formed, not by Lob-nor,
      which is situated 1° southwards, but by the Koncheh-daria, in its
      unremitted deflection to the west. The old bed Ilek, lake-shaped in places,
      and having a belt of salt lagoons and swamps along its eastern shores,
      represents remains of waters belonging, not to Lob-nor, but to the shifting
      river which has abandoned this old bed.</p>

    <p>“These facts and explanations refute the second point of the arguments
      which were brought forward by Sven Hedin in favour of his hypothesis,
      asserting the existence of some other Lob-nor.</p>

    <p>“I accept the third point of his objections, namely, that the grandfathers
      of the present inhabitants of the Lob-nor lived by a lake whose position
      was more to the north of Lob-nor; that was mentioned already by Pievtsov,
      and the lake was Uchu-Kul.</p>

    <p>“Why Marco Polo never mentioned the Lob-nor, I leave to more competent
      persons to decide.</p>

    <p>“The only inference which I can make from the preceding account is that
      the Kara-Koshun-Kul is not only the Lob-nor of my lamented teacher, N. M.
      Prjevalsky, but also <em>the ancient, the historical, and the true Lob-nor</em> of
      the Chinese geographers. So it was during the last thousand years, and so
      will it remain, if ‘the river of time’ in its running has not effaced it
      from the face of the Earth.”</p>

    <p>To Kozlov’s query: “Why Marco Polo never mentioned the Lob-nor, I leave to
      more competent persons to decide,” I have little hesitation in replying
      that he did not mention the Lob-nor because he did not see it. From
      Charchan, he followed, I believe, neither Prjevalsky’s nor Pievtsov’s
      route, but the old route from Khotan to Si-ngan fu, in the old bed of
      the Charchan daria, above and almost parallel to the new bed, to the
      Tarim,—then between Sven Hedin’s and Prjevalsky’s lakes, and across the
      desert to Shachau to join the ancient Chinese road of the Han Dynasty,
      partly explored by M. Bonin from Shachau.</p>

    <p>There is no doubt as to the discovery of Prjevalsky’s Lob-nor, but this
      does not appear to be the old Chinese Lob-nor; in fact, there may have been
      several lakes co-existent; probably there was one to the east of the mass
      of water described by Dr. Sven Hedin, near the old route from Korla to
      Shachau; there is no fixity in these waterspreads and the soil of this part
      of Asia, and in the course of a few years some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>discrepancies
      will naturally arise between the observations of different travellers. But as I think that
      Marco Polo did not see one of the Lob-nor, but travelled between them,
      there is no necessity to enlarge on this question, fully treated of in this note.</p>

      1894–1897, von Dr. Sven Hedin, Gotha, J. Perthes, 1900.</p>

    <p>Bonvalot and Prince Henri d’Orléans (<cite>De Paris au Tonkin, à travers le
      Tibet inconnu</cite>, Paris, 1892) followed this Itinerary: Semipalatinsk, Kulja,
      Korla, Lob-nor, Charkalyk, Altyn Tagh, almost a straight line to Tengri
      Nor, then to Batang, Ta Tsien lu, Ning-yuan, Yun-nan-fu, Mong-tsŭ, and Tung-King.</p>

    <p>Bonvalot (28th October, 1889) describes Lob in this manner: “The village of
      Lob is situated at some distance from [the Charchan daria]; its inhabitants
      come to see us; they are miserable, hungry, <em>étiques</em>; they offer us for
      sale smoked fish, duck taken with <em>lacet</em>. Some small presents soon make
      friends of them. They apprize us that news has spread that Pievtsov,
      the Russian traveller, will soon arrive” (<i>l.c.</i> p. 75). From Charkalyk,
      Prince Henri d’Orléans and Father Dedeken visited Lob-nor (<i>l.c.</i> p. 77 <i>et
      seq.</i>), but it was almost dry; the water had receded since Prjevalsky’s
      visit, thirteen years before. The Prince says the Lob-nor he saw was not
      Prjevalsky’s, nor was the latter’s lake the mass of water on Chinese maps;
      an old sorceress gave confirmation of the fact to the travellers. According
      to a tradition known from one generation to another, there was at this
      place a large inland sea without reeds, and the elders had seen in their
      youth large ponds; they say that the earth impregnated with saltpetre
      absorbs the water. The Prince says, according to tradition, <em>Lob</em> is a
      local name meaning “wild animals,” and it was given to the country at the
      time it was crossed by Kalmuk caravans; they added to the name <em>Lob</em> the
      Mongol word <em>Nor</em> (Great Lake). The travellers (p. 109) note that in fact
      the name Lob-nor does not apply to a Lake, but to the whole marshy part of
      the country watered by the Tarim, from the village of Lob to end of the river.</p>

    <p>The Pievtsov expedition “visited the Lob-nor (2650 feet) and the Tarim,
      whose proper name is Yarkend-daria (<em>tarim</em> means ‘a tilled field’ in
      Kashgarian). The lake is rapidly drying up, and a very old man, 110 years
      old, whom Pievtsov spoke to (his son, 52 years old, was the only one who
      could understand the old man), said that he would not have recognized
      the land if he had been absent all this time. Ninety years ago there was
      only a narrow strip of rushes in the south-west part of the lake, and
      the Yarkend-daria entered it 2½ miles to the west of its present mouth,
      where now stands the village of Abdal. The lake was then much deeper,
      and several villages, now abandoned, stood on its shores. There was also
      much more fish, and otters, which used to live there, but have long since
      disappeared. As to the Yarkend-daria, tradition says that two hundred years
      ago it used to enter another smaller lake, Uchukul, which was connected by
      a channel with the Lob-nor. This old bed, named Shirga-chapkan, can still
      be traced by the trees which grew along it. The greater previous extension
      of the Lob-nor is also confirmed by the freshwater molluscs (<i>Limnaea
      uricularia</i>, var. <i>ventricosa</i>, <i>L. stagnalis</i>, <i>L. peregra</i>, and <i>Planorbis
      sibiricus</i>), which are found at a distance from its present banks. Another
      lake, 400 miles in circumference, Kara-boyön (<em>black isthmus</em>), lies, as
      is known, 27 miles to the south-west of Lob-nor. To the east of the lake,
      a salt desert stretches for a seven days’ march, and further on begin the
      Kum-tagh sands, where wild camels live.” (<cite>Geog. Jour.</cite> IX. 1897, p. 552.)</p>

    <p>Grenard (III. pp. 194–195) discusses the Lob-nor question and the formation
      of four new lakes by the Koncheh-daria called by the natives beginning at
      the north; Kara Kul, Tayek Kul, Sugut Kul, Tokum Kul. He does not accept
      Baron v. Richthofen’s theory, and believes that the old Lob is the lake
      seen by Prjevalsky.</p>

    <p>He says (p. 149): “Lop must be looked for on the actual road from Charchan
      to Charkalyk. Ouash Shahri, five days from Charchan, and where small
      ruins are to be found, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>corresponds well to the position of Lop according
      to Marco Polo, a few degrees of the compass near. But the stream which
      passes at this spot could never be important enough for the wants of a
      considerable centre of habitation and the ruins of Ouash Shahri are more
      of a hamlet than of a town. Moreover, Lop was certainly the meeting point
      of the roads of Kashgar, Urumtsi, Shachau, L’Hasa, and Khotan, and it is
      to this fact that this town, situated in a very poor country, owed its
      relative importance. Now, it is impossible that these roads crossed at
      Ouash Shahri. I believe that Lop was built on the site of Charkalyk itself.
      The Venetian traveller gives five days’ journey between Charchan and Lop,
      whilst Charkalyk is really seven days from Charchan; but the objection does
      not appear sufficient to me: Marco Polo may well have made a mistake of two
      days.” (III. pp. 149–150.)</p>

    <p>The Chinese Governor of Urumtsi found some years ago to the north-west of
      the Lob-nor, on the banks of the Tarim, and within five days of Charkalyk,
      a town bearing the same name, though not on the same site as the Lop of
      Marco Polo.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXIX12" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIX12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—“The waste and desert places of the Earth are, so to speak, the
      characters which sin has visibly impressed on the outward creation; its
      signs and symbols there.... Out of a true feeling of this, men have ever
      conceived of the Wilderness as the haunt of evil spirits. In the old
      Persian religion Ahriman and his evil Spirits inhabit the steppes and
      wastes of Turan, to the north of the happy Iran, which stands under the
      dominion of Ormuzd; exactly as with the Egyptians, the evil Typhon is the
      Lord of the Libyan sand-wastes, and Osiris of the fertile Egypt.” (<cite>Archbp.
      Trench, Studies in the Gospels</cite>, p. 7.) Terror, and the seeming absence of
      a beneficent Providence, are suggestions of the Desert which must have led
      men to associate it with evil spirits, rather than the figure with which
      this passage begins; no spontaneous conception surely, however appropriate
      as a moral image.</p>

    <p>“According to the belief of the nations of Central Asia,” says I. J.
      Schmidt, “the earth and its interior, as well as the encompassing
      atmosphere, are filled with Spiritual Beings, which exercise an influence,
      partly beneficent, partly malignant, on the whole of organic and inorganic
      nature.... Especially are Deserts and other wild or uninhabited tracts,
      or regions in which the influences of nature are displayed on a gigantic
      and terrible scale, regarded as the chief abode or rendezvous of evil
      Spirits.... And hence the steppes of Turan, and in particular the great
      sandy Desert of Gobi have been looked on as the dwelling-place of malignant
      beings, from days of hoar antiquity.”</p>

    <p>The Chinese historian Ma Twan-lin informs us that there were two roads from
      China into the Uighúr country (towards Karashahr). The longest but easiest
      road was by Kamul. The other was much shorter, and apparently corresponded,
      as far as Lop, to that described in this chapter. “By this you have to
      cross a plain of sand, extending for more than 100 leagues. You see nothing
      in any direction but the sky and the sands, without the slightest trace of
      a road; and travellers find nothing to guide them but the bones of men and
      beasts and the droppings of camels. During the passage of this wilderness
      you hear sounds, sometimes of singing, sometimes of wailing; and it has
      often happened that travellers going aside to see what those sounds might
      be have strayed from their course and been entirely lost; for they were
      voices of spirits and goblins. ’Tis for these reasons that travellers and
      merchants often prefer the much longer route by Kamul.” (<cite>Visdelou</cite>, p. 139.)</p>

    <p>“In the Desert” (this same desert), says Fa-hian, “there are a great many
      evil demons; there are also sirocco winds, which kill all who encounter
      them. There are no birds or beasts to be seen; but so far as the eye can
      reach, the route is marked out by the bleached bones of men who have
      perished in the attempt to cross.”</p>

    <p>[“The Lew-sha was the subject of various most exaggerated stories. We find
      more trustworthy accounts of it in the <cite>Chow shu</cite>; thus it is mentioned in
      that history, that there sometimes arises in this desert a ‘burning wind,’
      pernicious to men and cattle; in such cases the old camels of the caravan,
      having a presentiment of its approach, flock shrieking to one place, lie
      down on the ground and hide their heads <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>in the sand. On this signal, the
      travellers also lie down, close nose and mouth, and remain in this position
      until the hurricane abates. Unless these precautions are taken, men and
      beasts inevitably perish.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 4.)</p>

    <p>A friend writes to me that he thinks that the accounts of strange noises
      in the desert would find a remarkable corroboration in the narratives of
      travellers through the central desert of Australia. They conjecture that
      they are caused by the sudden falling of cliffs of sand as the temperature
      changes at night time.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Hiuen Tsang, in his passage of the Desert, both outward and homeward,
      speaks of visual illusions; such as visions of troops marching and halting
      with gleaming arms and waving banners, constantly shifting, vanishing, and
      reappearing, “imagery created by demons.” A voice behind him calls, “Fear
      not! fear not!” Troubled by these fantasies on one occasion, he prays to
      Kwan-yin (a Buddhist divinity); still he could not entirely get rid of
      them; but as soon as he had pronounced a few words from the <cite>Prajna</cite> (a
      holy book), they vanished in the twinkling of an eye.</p>

    <p>These Goblins are not peculiar to the Gobi, though that appears to be their
      most favoured haunt. The awe of the vast and solitary Desert raises them in
      all similar localities. Pliny speaks of the phantoms that appear and vanish
      in the deserts of Africa; Aethicus, the early Christian cosmographer,
      speaks, though incredulous, of the stories that were told of the voices of
      singers and revellers in the desert; Mas’udi tells of the <em>Ghúls</em>, which
      in the deserts appear to travellers by night and in lonely hours; the
      traveller, taking them for comrades, follows and is led astray. But the
      wise revile them and the Ghúls vanish. Thus also Apollonius of Tyana and
      his companions, in a desert near the Indus by moonlight, see an <em>Empusa</em>
      or Ghúl taking many forms. They revile it, and it goes off uttering
      shrill cries. Mas’udi also speaks of the mysterious voices heard by lone
      wayfarers in the Desert, and he gives a rational explanation of them. Ibn
      Batuta relates a like legend of the Western Sahara: “If the messenger be
      solitary, the demons sport with him and fascinate him, so that he strays
      from his course and perishes.” The Afghan and Persian wildernesses also
      have their <em>Ghúl-i-Beában</em> or Goblin of the Waste, a gigantic and fearful
      spectre which devours travellers; and even the Gael of the West Highlands
      have the <em>Direach Ghlinn Eitidh</em>, the Desert Creature of Glen Eiti, which,
      one-handed, one-eyed, one-legged, seems exactly to answer to the Arabian
      Nesnás or <em>Empusa</em>. Nicolò Conti in the Chaldaean desert is aroused at
      midnight by a great noise, and sees a vast multitude pass by. The merchants
      tell him that these are demons who are in the habit of traversing the
      deserts. (<cite>Schmidt’s San. Setzen</cite>, p. 352; <cite>V. et V. de H. T.</cite> 23, 28, 289;

    <p>The sound of musical instruments, chiefly of drums, is a phenomenon of
      another class, and is really produced in certain situations among sandhills
      when the sand is disturbed. [See <i>supra</i>.] A very striking account of a
      phenomenon of this kind regarded as supernatural is given by Friar Odoric,
      whose experience I fancy I have traced to the <em>Reg Ruwán</em> or “Flowing Sand”
      north of Kabul. Besides this celebrated example, which has been described
      also by the Emperor Baber, I have noted that equally well-known one of the
      <em>Jibal Naḳús</em>, or “Hill of the Bell,” in the Sinai Desert; Wadi Hamade,
      in the vicinity of the same Desert; the <em>Jibal-ul-Thabúl</em>, or “Hill of
      the Drums,” between Medina and Mecca; one on the Island of Eigg, in the
      Hebrides, discovered by Hugh Miller; one among the Medanos or Sandhills
      of Arequipa, described to me by Mr. C. Markham; the Bramador or rumbling
      mountain of Tarapaca; one in hills between the Ulba and the Irtish, in the
      vicinity of the Altai, called the Almanac Hills, because the sounds are
      supposed to prognosticate weather-changes; and a remarkable example near
      Kolberg on the shore of Pomerania. A Chinese narrative of the 10th century
      mentions the phenomenon as known near Kwachau, on the eastern border of
      the Lop Desert, under the name of the “Singing Sands”; and Sir F. Goldsmid
      has recently made us acquainted with a second <em>Reg Ruwán</em>, on a hill near
      the Perso-Afghan frontier, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>a little to the north of Sístán. The place is
      frequented in pilgrimage. (See <cite>Cathay</cite>, pp. ccxliv. 156, 398; <cite>Ritter</cite>,
      II. 204; <cite>Aus der Natur</cite>, Leipzig, No. 47 [of 1868], p. 752; <cite>Rémusat, H.
      de Khotan</cite>, p. 74; <cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> XVII. 91.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXIX13" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIX13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—[We learn from Joseph Martin, quoted by Grenard, p. 170 (who met
      this unfortunate French traveller at Khotan, on his way from Peking to
      Marghelan, where he died), that from Shachau to Abdal, on the Lob-nor,
      there are twelve days of desert, sandy only during the first two days,
      stony afterwards. Occasionally a little grass is to be found for the
      camels; water is to be found everywhere. M. Bonin went from Shachau to
      the north-west towards the Kara-nor, then to the west, but lack of water
      compelled him to go back to Shachau. Along this road, every five <i>lis</i>,
      are to be found towers built with clay, and about 30 feet high, abandoned
      by the Chinese, who do not seem to have kept a remembrance of them in the
      country; this route seems to be a continuation of the Kan Suh Imperial
      highway. A wall now destroyed connected these towers together. “There
      is no doubt,” writes M. Bonin, “that all these remains are those of the
      great route, vainly sought after till now, which, under the Han Dynasty,
      ran to China through Bactria, Pamir, Eastern Turkestan, the Desert of
      Gobi, and Kan Suh: it is in part the route followed by Marco Polo, when
      he went from Charchan to Shachau, by the city of Lob.” The route of the
      Han has been also looked for, more to the south, and it was believed that
      it was the same as that of the Astyn Tagh, followed by Mr. Littledale in
      1893, who travelled one month from Abdal (Lob-nor) to Shachau; M. Bonin,
      who explored also this route, and was twenty-three days from Shachau to
      Lob-nor, says it could not be a commercial road. Dr. Sven Hedin saw four or
      five towers eastward of the junction of the Tarim and the Koncheh-daria; it
      may possibly have been another part of the road seen by M. Bonin. (See <cite>La

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Great Province of Tangut.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> you have travelled thirty days through the Desert, as I have
    described, you come to a city called <span class="smcap">Sachiu</span>, lying between north-east
    and east; it belongs to the Great Kaan, and is in a province called
    <span class="smcap">Tangut</span>.<a id="NoteAnchor_XL11" href="#Note_XL11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> The people are for the most part Idolaters, but there are
    also some Nestorian Christians and some Saracens. The Idolaters have a
    peculiar language, and are no traders, but live by their agriculture.<a id="NoteAnchor_XL12" href="#Note_XL12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    They have a great many abbeys and minsters full of idols of sundry
    fashions, to which they pay great honour and reverence, worshipping them
    and sacrificing to them with much ado. For example, such as have children
    will feed up a sheep <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>in honour of the idol, and at the New Year, or on the
    day of the Idol’s Feast, they will take their children and the sheep along
    with them into the presence of the idol with great ceremony. Then they
    will have the sheep slaughtered and cooked, and again present it before
    the idol with like reverence, and leave it there before him, whilst they
    are reciting the offices of their worship and their prayers for the idol’s
    blessing on their children. And, if you will believe them, the idol feeds
    on the meat that is set before it! After these ceremonies they take up the
    flesh and carry it home, and call together all their kindred to eat it with
    them in great festivity [the idol-priests receiving for their portion the
    head, feet, entrails, and skin, with some part of the meat]. After they
    have eaten, they collect the bones that are left and store them carefully
    in a hutch.<a id="NoteAnchor_XL13" href="#Note_XL13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>And you must know that all the Idolaters in the world burn their dead. And
    when they are going to carry a body to the burning, the kinsfolk build
    a wooden house on the way to the spot, and drape it with cloths of silk
    and gold. When the body is going past this building they call a halt and
    set before it wine and meat and other eatables; and this they do with the
    assurance that the defunct will be received with the like attentions in
    the other world. All the minstrelsy in the town goes playing before the
    body; and when it reaches the burning-place the kinsfolk are prepared with
    figures cut out of parchment and paper in the shape of men and horses and
    camels, and also with round pieces of paper like gold coins, and all these
    they burn along with the corpse. For they say that in the other world
    the defunct will be provided with slaves and cattle and money, just in
    proportion to the amount of such pieces of paper that has been burnt along
    with him.<a id="NoteAnchor_XL14" href="#Note_XL14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>But they never burn their dead until they have [sent <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>for the astrologers,
    and told them the year, the day, and the hour of the deceased person’s
    birth, and when the astrologers have ascertained under what constellation,
    planet, and sign he was born, they declare the day on which, by the rules
    of their art, he ought to be burnt]. And till that day arrive they keep the
    body, so that ’tis sometimes a matter of six months, more or less, before
    it comes to be burnt.<a id="NoteAnchor_XL15" href="#Note_XL15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>Now the way they keep the body in the house is this: They make a coffin
    first of a good span in thickness, very carefully joined and daintily
    painted. This they fill up with camphor and spices, to keep off corruption
    [stopping the joints with pitch and lime], and then they cover it with a
    fine cloth. Every day as long as the body is kept, they set a table before
    the dead covered with food; and they will have it that the soul comes and
    eats and drinks: wherefore they leave the food there as long as would be
    necessary in order that one should partake. Thus they do daily. And worse
    still! Sometimes those soothsayers shall tell them that ’tis not good luck
    to carry out the corpse by the door, so they have to break a hole in the
    wall, and to draw it out that way when it is taken to the burning.<a id="NoteAnchor_XL16" href="#Note_XL16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a>
    And these, I assure you, are the practices of all the Idolaters of those countries.</p>

  <p>However, we will quit this subject, and I will tell you of another city
    which lies towards the north-west at the extremity of the desert.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XL11" href="#NoteAnchor_XL11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      1.</a>—[The Natives of this country were called by the Chinese
      <em>T’ang-hiang</em>, and by the Mongols <em>T’angu</em> or <em>T’ang-wu</em>, and with the
      plural suffix <em>Tangut</em>. The kingdom of Tangut, or in Chinese, <em>Si Hia</em>
      (Western Hia), or <em>Ho si</em> (West of the Yellow River), was declared
      independent in 982 by Li Chi Ch’ien, who had the dynastic title or <em>Miao
      Hao</em> of Tai Tsu. “The rulers of Tangut,” says Dr. Bushell, “were scions of
      the Toba race, who reigned over North China as the Wei Dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 386–557),
      as well as in some of the minor dynasties which succeeded. Claiming
      descent from the ancient Chinese Hsia Dynasty of the second millennium
      <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, they adopted the title of <em>Ta Hsia</em> (‘Great Hsia’), and the dynasty
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>is generally called by the Chinese Hsi Hsia, or Western Hsia.” This is a
      list of the Tangut sovereigns, with the date of their accession to the
      throne: Tai Tsu (982), Tai Tsung (1002), Ching Tsung (1032), Yi Tsung
      (1049), Hui Tsung (1068), Ch’ung Tsung (1087), Jen Tsung (1140), Huan Tsung
      (1194), Hsiang Tsung (1206), Shên Tsung (1213), Hien Tsung (1223), Mo Chu
      (1227). In fact, the real founder of the Dynasty was Li Yuan-hao, who
      conquered in 1031, the cities of Kanchau and Suhchau from the Uighúr Turks,
      declaring himself independent in 1032, and who adopted in 1036 a special
      script of which we spoke when mentioning the archway at Kiuyung Kwan. His
      capital was Hia chau, now Ning hia, on the Yellow River. Chinghiz invaded
      Tangut three times, in 1206, 1217, and at last in 1225; the final struggle
      took place the following year, when Kanchau, Liangchau, and Suhchau fell
      into the hands of the Mongols. After the death of Chinghiz (1227), the
      last ruler of Tangut, Li H’ien, who surrendered the same year to Okkodaï,
      son of the conqueror, was killed. The dominions of Tangut in the middle of
      the 11th century, according to the <em>Si Hia Chi Shih Pên Mo</em>, quoted by Dr.
      Bushell, “were bounded, according to the map, by the Sung Empire on the
      south and east, by the Liao (Khitan) on the north-east, the Tartars (Tata)
      on the north, the Uighúr Turks (Hui-hu) on the west, and the Tibetans on
      the south-west. The Alashan Mountains stretch along the northern frontier,
      and the western extends to the Jade Gate (Yü Mên Kwan) on the border of the
      Desert of Gobi.” Under the Mongol Dynasty, Kan Suh was the official name of
      one of the twelve provinces of the Empire, and the popular name was Tangut.</p>

    <p>(Dr. S. W. Bushell: <cite>Inscriptions in the Juchen and Allied Scripts</cite> and
      <cite>The Hsi Hsia Dynasty of Tangut</cite>. See above, p. 29.)</p>

    <p>“The word Tangutan applied by the Chinese and by Colonel Prjevalsky to a
      Tibetan-speaking people around the Koko-nor has been explained to me in a
      variety of ways by native Tangutans. A very learned lama from the Gserdkog
      monastery, south-east of the Koko-nor, told me that Tangutan, Amdoans, and
      Sifan were interchangeable terms, but I fear his geographical knowledge was
      a little vague. The following explanation of the term Tangut is taken from
      the <cite>Hsi-tsang-fu</cite>. ‘The Tangutans are descendants of the <em>Tang-tu-chüeh</em>.
      The origin of this name is as follows: In early days, the Tangutans lived
      in the Central Asian Chin-shan, where they were workers of iron. They made
      a model of the Chin-shan, which, in shape, resembled an iron helmet. Now,
      in their language, “iron helmet” is <em>Tang-küeh</em>, hence the name of
      the country. To the present day, the Tangutans of the Koko-nor wear a hat
      shaped like a pot, high crowned and narrow, rimmed with red fringe sewn
      on it, so that it looks like an iron helmet, and this is a proof of [the
      accuracy of the derivation].’ Although the proof is not very satisfactory,
      it is as good as we are often offered by authors with greater pretension to learning.</p>

    <p>“If I remember rightly, Prjevalsky derives the name from two words meaning
      ‘black tents.’” (<cite>W. W. Rockhill, China Br. R. As. Soc.</cite>, XX. pp. 278–279.)</p>

    <p>“Chinese authorities tell us that the name [Tangut] was originally borne
      by a people living in the Altaï, and that the word is Turkish.... The
      population of Tangut was a mixture of Tibetans, Turks, Uighúrs, Tukuhuns,
      Chinese, etc.” (<cite>Rockhill</cite>, <cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 150, note.—H.&nbsp;C.)]</p>

    <p><em>Sachiu</em> is <span class="smcap">Shachau</span>, “Sand-district,” an outpost of China Proper, at the
      eastern verge of the worst part of the Sandy Desert. It is recorded to have
      been fortified in the 1st century as a barrier against the Hiongnu.</p>

    <p>[The name of Shachau dates from <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 622, when it was founded by the first
      emperor of the T’ang Dynasty. Formerly, Shachau was one of the Chinese
      colonies established by the Han, at the expense of the Hiongnu; it was
      called T’ung hoang (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 111), a name still given to Shachau; the other
      colonies were Kiu-kaan (Suhchau, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 121) and Chang-yé (Kanchau, <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
      111). (See <cite>Bretschneider, Med. Res.</cite> II. 18.)</p>

    <p>“Sha-chow, the present <em>Tun-hwang-hien</em> (a few <i>li</i> east of the ancient
      town).... In 1820, or about that time, an attempt was made to re-establish
      the ancient direct way between Sha-chow and Khotan. With this object in
      view, an exploring party of ten men was sent from Khotan towards Sha-chow;
      this party wandered in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>desert over a month, and found neither dwellings
      nor roads, but pastures and water everywhere. M. Polo omits to mention a
      remarkable place at Sha-chow, a sandy hillock (a short distance south of
      this town) known under the name of <em>Ming-sha shan</em>—the ‘rumbling sandhill.’
      The sand, in rolling down the hill, produces a particular sound, similar
      to that of distant thunder. In M. Polo’s time (1292), Khubilaï removed the
      inhabitants of Sha-chow to the interior of China; fearing, probably, the
      aggression of the seditious princes; and his successor, in 1303, placed
      there a garrison of ten thousand men.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 5.)</p>

    <p>“Sha-chau is one of the best oases of Central Asia. It is situated at the
      foot of the Nan-shan range, at a height of 3700 feet above the sea, and
      occupies an area of about 200 square miles, the whole of which is thickly
      inhabited by Chinese. Sha-chau is interesting as the meeting-place of three
      expeditions started independently from Russia, India, and China. Just
      two months before Prjevalsky reached this town, it was visited by Count
      Szechényi [April, 1879], and eighteen months afterwards Pundit A-k, whose
      report of it agrees fairly well with that of our traveller, also stayed
      here. Both Prejevalsky and Szechényi remark on some curious caves in a
      valley near Sha-chau containing Buddhistic clay idols.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> These caves were
      in Marco Polo’s time the resort of numerous worshippers, and are said to
      date back to the Han Dynasty.” (<cite>Prejevalsky’s Journeys</cite> ... by E. Delmar
      Morgan, <cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> IX. 1887, pp. 217–218.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XL12" href="#NoteAnchor_XL12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—By <em>Idolaters</em>, Polo here means Buddhists, as generally. We do not
      know whether the Buddhism here was a recent introduction from Tibet, or
      a relic of the old Buddhism of Khotan and other Central Asian kingdoms,
      but most probably it was the former, and the “peculiar language” ascribed
      to them may have been, as Neumann supposes, Tibetan. This language in
      modern Mongolia answers to the Latin of the Mass Book, indeed with a
      curious exactness, for in both cases the holy tongue is not that of the
      original propagators of the respective religions, but that of the hierarchy
      which has assumed their government. In the Lamaitic convents of China
      and Manchuria also the Tibetan only is used in worship, except at one
      privileged temple at Peking. (<cite>Koeppen</cite>, II. 288.) The language intended by
      Polo may, however, have been a Chinese dialect. (See notes 1 and 4.) The
      Nestorians must have been tolerably numerous in Tangut, for it formed a
      metropolitan province of their Church.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XL13" href="#NoteAnchor_XL13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—A practice resembling this is mentioned by Pallas as existing among
      the Buddhist Kalmaks, a relic of their old Shaman superstitions, which the
      Lamas profess to decry, but sometimes take part in. “Rich Kalmaks select
      from their flock a ram for dedication, which gets the name of <em>Tengri
      Tockho</em>, ‘Heaven’s Ram.’ It must be a white one with a yellow head. He must
      never be shorn or sold, but when he gets old, and the owner chooses to
      dedicate a fresh one, then the old one must be sacrificed. This is usually
      done in autumn, when the sheep are fattest, and the neighbours are called
      together to eat the sacrifice. A fortunate day is selected, and the ram is
      slaughtered amid the cries of the sorcerer directed towards the sunrise,
      and the diligent sprinkling of milk for the benefit of the Spirits of the
      Air. The flesh is eaten, but the skeleton with a part of the fat is burnt
      on a turf altar erected on four pillars of an ell and a half high, and the
      skin, with the head and feet, is then hung up in the way practised by the
      Buraets.” (<cite>Sammlungen</cite>, II. 346.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XL14" href="#NoteAnchor_XL14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—Several of the customs of Tangut mentioned in this chapter are
      essentially Chinese, and are perhaps introduced here because it was on
      entering Tangut that the traveller first came in contact with Chinese
      peculiarities. This is true of the manner of forming coffins, and keeping
      them with the body in the house, serving food <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>before the coffin whilst
      it is so kept, the burning of paper and papier-maché figures of slaves,
      horses, etc., at the tomb. Chinese settlers were very numerous at Shachau
      and the neighbouring Kwachau, even in the 10th century. (<cite>Ritter</cite>, II.
      213.) [“Keeping a body unburied for a considerable time is called <em>khǹg
      koan</em>, ‘to conceal or store away a coffin,’ or <em>thîng koan</em>, ‘to detain
      a coffin.’ It is, of course, a matter of necessity in such cases to have
      the cracks and fissures, and especially the seam where the case and the
      lid join, hermetically caulked. This is done by means of a mixture of
      chunam and oil. The seams, sometimes even the whole coffin, are pasted
      over with linen, and finally everything is varnished black, or, in case of
      a mandarin of rank, red. In process of time, the varnishing is repeated
      as many times as the family think desirable or necessary. And in order to
      protect the coffin still better against dust and moisture, it is generally
      covered with sheets of oiled paper, over which comes a white pall.” (<cite>De
      Groot</cite>, I. 106.)—H.&nbsp;C.] Even as regards the South of China many of the
      circumstances mentioned here are strictly applicable, as may be seen in
      <cite>Doolittle’s Social Life of the Chinese</cite>. (See, for example, p. 135; also
      <cite>Astley</cite>, IV. 93–95, or Marsden’s quotations from <cite>Duhalde</cite>.) The custom
      of burning the dead has been for several centuries disused in China, but
      we shall see hereafter that Polo represents it as general in his time. On
      the custom of burning gilt paper in the form of gold coin, as well as of
      paper clothing, paper houses, furniture, slaves, etc., see also <cite>Medhurst</cite>,
      p. 213, and <cite>Kidd</cite>, 177–178. No one who has read Père Huc will forget his
      ludicrous account of the Lama’s charitable distribution of paper horses
      for the good of disabled travellers. The manufacture of mock money is a
      large business in Chinese cities. In Fuchau there are more than thirty
      large establishments where it is kept for sale. (<cite>Doolittle</cite>, 541.) [The
      Chinese believe that sheets of paper, partly tinned over on one side, are,
      “according to the prevailing conviction, turned by the process of fire
      into real silver currency available in the world of darkness, and sent
      there through the smoke to the soul; they are called <em>gûn-tsoá</em>, ‘silver
      paper.’ Most families prefer to previously fold every sheet in the shape of
      a hollow ingot, a ‘silver ingot,’ <em>gûn-khò</em>, as they call it. This requires
      a great amount of labour and time, but increases the value of the treasure
      immensely.” (<cite>De Groot</cite>, I. 25.) “Presenting paper money when paying
      a visit of condolence is a custom firmly established, and accordingly
      complied with by everybody with great strictness.... The paper is designed
      for the equipment of the coffin, and, accordingly, always denoted by the
      term <em>koan-thaô-tsoá</em>, ‘coffin paper.’ But as the receptacle of the dead
      is, of course, not spacious enough to hold the whole mass offered by so
      many friends, it is regularly burned by lots by the side of the corpse,
      the ashes being carefully collected to be afterwards wrapped in paper and
      placed in the coffin, or at the side of the coffin, in the tomb.” (<cite>De
      Groot</cite>, I. 31–32.)—H.&nbsp;C.] There can be little doubt that these latter
      customs are symbols of the ancient sacrifices of human beings and valuable
      property on such occasions; so Manetho states that the Egyptians in days
      of yore used human sacrifices, but a certain King Amosis abolished them
      and substituted images of wax. Even when the present Manchu Dynasty first
      occupied the throne of China, they still retained the practice of human
      sacrifice. At the death of Kanghi’s mother, however, in 1718, when four
      young girls offered themselves for sacrifice on the tomb of their mistress,
      the emperor would not allow it, and prohibited for the future the sacrifice
      of life or the destruction of valuables on such occasions. (<cite>Deguignes,
      Voy.</cite> I. 304.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XL15" href="#NoteAnchor_XL15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—Even among the Tibetans and Mongols burning is only one of the
      modes of disposing of the dead. “They sometimes bury their dead: often
      they leave them exposed in their coffins, or cover them with stones,
      paying regard to the sign under which the deceased was born, his age, the
      day and hour of his death, which determine the mode in which he is to be
      interred (or otherwise disposed of). For this purpose they consult some
      books which are explained to them by the Lamas.” (<cite>Timk.</cite> II. 312.) The
      extraordinary and complex absurdities of the books in question are given
      in detail by Pallas, and curiously illustrate the paragraph in the text.
      (See <cite>Sammlungen</cite>, II. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>254 <i>seqq.</i>) [“The first seven days, including that
      on which the demise has taken place, are generally deemed to be lucky for
      the burial, especially the odd ones. But when they have elapsed, it becomes
      requisite to apply to a day-professor.... The popular almanac which chiefly
      wields sway in Amoy and the surrounding country, regularly stigmatises
      a certain number of days as <em>tîng-sng jít</em>: ‘days of reduplication of
      death,’ because encoffining or burying a dead person on such a day will
      entail another loss in the family shortly afterwards.” (<cite>De Groot</cite>, I. 103,
      99–100.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XL16" href="#NoteAnchor_XL16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—The Chinese have also, according to Duhalde, a custom of making a
      new opening in the wall of a house by which to carry out the dead; and in
      their prisons a special hole in the wall is provided for this office. This
      same custom exists among the Esquimaux, as well as, according to Sonnerat,
      in Southern India, and it used to exist in certain parts both of Holland
      and of Central Italy. In the “clean village of Broek,” near Amsterdam,
      those special doors may still be seen. And in certain towns of Umbria, such
      as Perugia, Assisi, and Gubbio, this opening was common, elevated some feet
      above the ground, and known as the “Door of the Dead.”</p>

    <p>I find in a list, printed by Liebrecht, of popular French superstitions,
      amounting to 479 in number, condemned by Maupas du Tour, Bishop of Evreux
      in 1664, the following: “When a woman lies in of a dead child, it must
      not be taken out by the door of the chamber but by the window, for if it
      were taken out by the door the woman would never lie in of any but dead
      children.” The Samoyedes have the superstition mentioned in the text, and
      act exactly as Polo describes.</p>

    <p>[“The body [of the Queen of Bali, 17th century] was drawn out of a large
      aperture made in the wall to the right hand side of the door, in the
      absurd opinion of <em>cheating the devil</em>, whom these islanders believe to
      lie in wait in the ordinary passage.” (<cite>John Crawford, Hist. of the Indian
      Archipelago</cite>, II. p. 245.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>And the Rev. Mr. Jaeschke writes to me from Lahaul, in British Tibet:
      “Our Lama (from Central Tibet) tells us that the owner of a house and the
      members of his family when they die are carried through the house-door;
      but if another person dies in the house his body is removed by some other
      aperture, such as a window, or the smokehole in the roof, or a hole in the
      wall dug expressly for the purpose. Or a wooden frame is made, fitting into
      the doorway, and the body is then carried through; it being considered
      that by this contrivance the evil consequences are escaped that might
      ensue, were it carried through the ordinary, and, so to say, <em>undisguised</em>
      house-door! Here, in Lahaul and the neighbouring countries, we have not
      heard of such a custom.”</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Province of Camul.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Camul</span> is a province which in former days was a kingdom. It contains
    numerous towns and villages, but the chief city bears the name of <span class="smcap">Camul</span>.
    The province lies between the two deserts; for on the one side is the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>Great Desert of Lop, and on the other side is a small desert of three
    days’ journey in extent.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLI11" href="#Note_XLI11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> The people are all Idolaters, and have a
    peculiar language. They live by the fruits of the earth, which they have
    in plenty, and dispose of to travellers. They are a people who take things
    very easily, for they mind nothing but playing and singing, and dancing and
    enjoying themselves.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLI12" href="#Note_XLI12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>And it is the truth that if a foreigner comes to the house of one of these
    people to lodge, the host is delighted, and desires his wife to put herself
    entirely at the guest’s disposal, whilst he himself gets out of the way,
    and comes back no more until the stranger shall have taken his departure.
    The guest may stay and enjoy the wife’s society as long as he lists, whilst
    the husband has no shame in the matter, but indeed considers it an honour.
    And all the men of this province are made wittols of by their wives in this
    way.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLI13" href="#Note_XLI13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> The women themselves are fair and wanton.</p>

  <p>Now it came to pass during the reign of <span class="smcap">Mangu Kaan</span>, that as lord of this
    province he came to hear of this custom, and he sent forth an order
    commanding them under grievous penalties to do so no more [but to provide
    public hostelries for travellers]. And when they heard this order they
    were much vexed thereat. [For about three years’ space they carried it
    out. But then they found that their lands were no longer fruitful, and
    that many mishaps befell them.] So they collected together and prepared a
    grand present which they sent to their Lord, praying him graciously to let
    them retain the custom which they had inherited from their ancestors; for
    it was by reason of this usage that their gods bestowed upon them all the
    good things that they possessed, and without it they saw not how they could
    continue to exist.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLI14" href="#Note_XLI14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> When the Prince had heard their petition his
    reply was “Since ye must needs keep your shame, keep it then,” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>and so he
    left them at liberty to maintain their naughty custom. And they always have
    kept it up, and do so still.</p>

  <p>Now let us quit Camul, and I will tell you of another province which lies
    between north-west and north, and belongs to the Great Kaan.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XLI11" href="#NoteAnchor_XLI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Kamul (or Komul) does not fall into the great line of travel
      towards Cathay which Marco is following. His notice of it, and of the
      next province, forms a digression like that which he has already made
      to Samarkand. It appears very doubtful if Marco himself had visited it;
      his father and uncle may have done so on their first journey, as one of
      the chief routes to Northern China from Western Asia lies through this
      city, and has done so for many centuries. This was the route described by
      Pegolotti as that of the Italian traders in the century following Polo;
      it was that followed by Marignolli, by the envoys of Shah Rukh at a later
      date, and at a much later by Benedict Goës. The people were in Polo’s time
      apparently Buddhist, as the Uighúrs inhabiting this region had been from an
      old date: in Shah Rukh’s time (1420) we find a mosque and a great Buddhist
      Temple cheek by jowl; whilst Ramusio’s friend Hajji Mahomed (<i>circa</i> 1550)
      speaks of Kamul as the first Mahomedan city met with in travelling from China.</p>

    <p>Kamul stands on an oasis carefully cultivated by aid of reservoirs for
      irrigation, and is noted in China for its rice and for some of its fruits,
      especially melons and grapes. It is still a place of some consequence,
      standing near the bifurcation of two great roads from China, one passing
      north and the other south of the Thian Shan, and it was the site of the
      Chinese Commissariat depôts for the garrisons to the westward. It was lost
      to the Chinese in 1867.</p>

    <p>Kamul appears to have been the see of a Nestorian bishop. A Bishop of Kamul
      is mentioned as present at the inauguration of the Catholicos Denha in
      1266. (<cite>Russians in Cent. Asia</cite>, 129; <cite>Ritter</cite>, II. 357 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Cathay,
      passim</cite>; <cite>Assemani</cite>, II. 455–456.)</p>

    <p>[<em>Kamul</em> is the Turkish name of the province called by the Mongols
      <em>Khamil</em>, by the Chinese <em>Hami</em>; the latter name is found for the first
      time in the <cite>Yuen Shi</cite>, but it is first mentioned in Chinese history
      in the 1st century of our Era under the name of <em>I-wu-lu</em> or <em>I-wu</em>
      (<cite>Bretschneider, Med. Res.</cite> II. p. 20); after the death of Chinghiz, it
      belonged to his son Chagataï. From the Great Wall, at the Pass of Kia Yü,
      to Hami there is a distance of 1470 <i>li</i>. (<cite>C. Imbault-Huart. Le Pays de
      Hami ou Khamil</cite> ... d’après les auteurs chinois, <cite>Bul. de Géog. hist. et
      desc.</cite>, Paris, 1892, pp. 121–195.) The Chinese general Chang Yao was in
      1877 at Hami, which had submitted in 1867 to the Athalik Ghazi, and made it
      the basis of his operations against the small towns of Chightam and Pidjam,
      and Yakúb Khan himself stationed at Turfan. The Imperial Chinese Agent
      in this region bears the title of <em>K’u lun Pan She Ta Ch’en</em> and resides
      at K’urun (Urga); of lesser rank are the agents (<em>Pan She Ta Ch’en</em>) of
      Kashgar, Kharashar, Kuché, Aksu, Khotan, and Hami. (See a description of
      Hami by Colonel M. S. Bell, <cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> XII. 1890, p. 213.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XLI12" href="#NoteAnchor_XLI12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—Expressed almost in the same words is the character attributed by a
      Chinese writer to the people of Kuché in the same region. (<cite>Chin. Repos.</cite>
      IX. 126.) In fact, the character seems to be generally applicable to the
      people of East Turkestan, but sorely kept down by the rigid Islam that
      is now enforced. (See <cite>Shaw, passim</cite>, and especially the Mahrambáshi’s
      lamentations over the jolly days that were no more, pp. 319, 376.)</p>

      3.</a>—Pauthier’s text has “<i lang="fr">sont si</i> honni <i lang="fr">de leur moliers comme vous
      avez ouy</i>.” Here the Crusca has “<em>sono</em> bozzi <em>delle loro moglie</em>,” and
      the Lat. Geog. “<em>sunt</em> bezzi <em>de suis uxoribus</em>.” The Crusca Vocab. has
      inserted <em>bozzo</em> with the meaning we have given, on the strength of this
      passage. It occurs also in Dante (<cite>Paradiso</cite>, XIX. 137), in the general
      sense of <em>disgraced</em>.</p>

    <p>The shameful custom here spoken of is ascribed by Polo also to a province
      of Eastern Tibet, and by popular report in modern times to the Hazaras of
      the Hindu-Kush, a people of Mongolian blood, as well as to certain nomad
      tribes of Persia, to say nothing of the like accusation against our own
      ancestors which has been drawn from Laonicus Chalcondylas. The old Arab
      traveller Ibn Muhalhal (10th century) also relates the same of the Hazlakh
      (probably <em>Kharlikh</em>) Turks: <span lang="la">“Ducis alicujus uxor vel filia vel soror, quum
      mercatorum agmen in terram venit, eos adit, eorumque lustrat faciem. Quorum
      siquis earum afficit admiratione hunc domum suam ducit, eumque apud se
      hospitio excipit, eique benigne facit. Atque marito suo et filio fratrique
      rerum necessariarum curam demandat; neque dum hospes apud eam habitat,
      nisi necessarium est, maritus eam adit.”</span> A like custom prevails among
      the Chukchis and Koryaks in the vicinity of Kamtchatka. (<cite>Elphinstone’s

    <p>[“It is remarkable that the Chinese author, <cite>Hung Hao</cite>, who lived a century
      before M. Polo, makes mention in his memoirs nearly in the same words of
      this custom of the Uighúrs, with whom he became acquainted during his
      captivity in the kingdom of the <em>Kin</em>. According to the chronicle of the
      Tangut kingdom of Si-hia, Hami was the nursery of Buddhism in Si-hia, and
      provided this kingdom with Buddhist books and monks.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p.

  <p>Everybody must be aware that it can be no animal’s nature to live in fire,
    seeing that every animal is composed of all the four elements.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLII14" href="#Note_XLII14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> Now
    I, Marco Polo, had a Turkish acquaintance of the name of Zurficar, and he
    was a very clever fellow. And this Turk related to Messer Marco Polo how he
    had lived three years in that region on behalf of the Great Kaan, in order
    to procure those Salamanders for him.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLII15" href="#Note_XLII15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a> He said that the way they got
    them was by digging in that mountain till they found a certain vein. The
    substance of this vein was then taken and crushed, and when so treated it
    divides as it were into fibres of wool, which they set forth to dry. When
    dry, these fibres were pounded in a great copper mortar, and then washed,
    so as to remove all the earth and to leave only the fibres like fibres of
    wool. These were then spun, and made into napkins. When first made these
    napkins are not very white, but by putting them into the fire for a while
    they come out as white as snow. And so again whenever they become dirty
    they are bleached by being put in the fire.</p>

  <p>Now this, and nought else, is the truth about the Salamander, and the
    people of the country all say the same. Any other account of the matter is
    fabulous nonsense. And I may add that they have at Rome a napkin of this
    stuff, which the Grand Kaan sent to the Pope to make a wrapper for the Holy
    Sudarium of Jesus Christ.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLII16" href="#Note_XLII16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <p>We will now quit this subject, and I will proceed with my account of the
    countries lying in the direction between north-east and east.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XLII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XLII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The identification of this province is a difficulty, because the
      geographical definition is vague, and the name assigned to it has not been
      traced in other authors. It is said to lie <em>between north-west and north</em>,
      whilst Kamul was said to lie <em>towards the north-west</em>. The account of
      both provinces forms a digression, as is clear from the last words of the
      present chapter, where the traveller returns to take up his regular route
      “in the direction between north-east and east.” The point from which he
      digresses, and to which he reverts, is Shachau, and ’tis presumably from
      Shachau that he assigns bearings to the two provinces forming the subject
      of the digression. Hence, as Kamul lies <i lang="fr">vers maistre</i>, <i>i.e.</i> north-west,
      and Chingintalas <i lang="fr">entre maistre et tramontaine</i>, <i>i.e.</i> nor’-nor’-west,
      Chingintalas can scarcely lie due west of Kamul, as M. Pauthier would
      place it, in identifying it with an obscure place called <em>Saiyintala</em>, in
      the territory of Urumtsi. Moreover, the province is said to belong to the
      Great Kaan. Now, <em>Urumtsi</em> or Bishbalik seems to have belonged, not to the
      Great Kaan, but to the empire of Chagatai, or possibly at this time to
      Kaidu. Rashiduddin, speaking of the frontier between the Kaan and Kaidu,
      says:—“From point to point are posted bodies of troops under the orders of
      princes of the blood or other generals, and they often come to blows with
      the troops of Kaidu. Five of these are cantoned on the verge of the Desert;
      a sixth in Tangut, near Chagan-Nor (White Lake); a seventh in the vicinity
      of Karakhoja, a city of the Uighúrs, which lies between the two States, and
      maintains neutrality.”</p>

    <p>Karakhoja, this neutral town, is near Turfan, to the south-east of Urumtsi,
      which thus would lie <em>without</em> the Kaan’s boundary; Kamul and the country
      north-east of it would lie within it. This country, to the north and
      north-east of Kamul, has remained till quite recently unexplored by any
      modern traveller, unless we put faith in Mr. Atkinson’s somewhat hazy
      narrative. But it is here that I would seek for Chingintalas.</p>

    <p>Several possible explanations of this name have suggested themselves or
      been suggested to me. I will mention two.</p>

    <p>1. Klaproth states that the Mongols applied to Tibet the name of
      <em>Baron-tala</em>, signifying the “Right Side,” <i>i.e.</i> the south-west or south
      quarter, whilst Mongolia was called <em>Dzöhn</em> (or <em>Dzegun</em>) <em>Tala</em>, <i>i.e.</i>
      the “Left,” or north-east side. It is possible that <em>Chigin-talas</em> might
      represent <em>Dzegun Tala</em> in some like application. The etymology of
      <em>Dzungaria</em>, a name which in modern times covers the territory of which we
      are speaking, is similar.</p>

    <p>2. Professor Vámbéry thinks that it is probably <em>Chingin Tala</em>, “The Vast
      Plain.” But nothing can be absolutely satisfactory in such a case except
      historical evidence of the application of the name.</p>

    <p>I have left the identity of this name undecided, though pointing to the
      general position of the region so-called by Marco, as indicated by the
      vicinity of the Tangnu-Ola Mountains (<a href="#Page_215">p. 215</a>). A passage in the Journey
      of the Taouist Doctor, Changchun, as translated by Dr. Bretschneider
      (<cite>Chinese Recorder and Miss. Journ.</cite>, Shanghai, Sept.–Oct., 1874, p. 258),
      suggests to me the strong probability that it may be the <em>Kem-kém-jút</em> of
      Rashiduddin, called by the Chinese teacher <em>Kien-kien</em>-chau.</p>

    <p>Rashiduddin couples the territory of the Kirghiz with Kemkemjút,
      but defines the country embracing both with some exactness: “On one
      side (south-east?), it bordered on the Mongol country; on a second
      (north-east?), it was bounded by the Selenga; on a third (north), by the
      ‘great river called Angara, which flows on the confines of Ibir-Sibir’
      (<i>i.e.</i> of Siberia); on a fourth side by the territory of the Naimans. This
      great country contained <em>many towns and villages</em>, as well as many nomad
      inhabitants.” Dr. Bretschneider’s Chinese Traveller speaks of it as a
      country where <em>good iron was found</em>, where (grey) squirrels abounded, and
      wheat was cultivated. Other notices quoted by him show that it lay to the
      south-east of the Kirghiz country, and had its name from the <em>Kien</em> or
      <em>Ken</em> R. (<i>i.e.</i> the Upper Yenisei).</p>

    <p>The name (<em>Kienkien</em>), the general direction, the existence of good iron
      (“steel and ondanique”), the many towns and villages in a position where
      we should little look for such an indication, all point to the identity of
      this region with the Chingintalas of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>our text. The only alteration called
      for in the <a href="#i464">Itinerary Map (No. IV.)</a> would be to spell the name <em>Hinkin</em>,
      or <em>Ghinghin</em> (as it <em>is</em> in the Geographic Text), and to shift it a very
      little further to the north.</p>

    <p>(See <em>Chingin</em> in <cite>Kovalevski’s Mongol Dict.</cite>, No. 2134; and for
      <em>Baron-tala</em>, etc., see <cite>Della Penna, Breve Notizia del Regno del Thibet</cite>,
      with Klaproth’s notes, p. 6; <cite>D’Avezac</cite>, p. 568; <cite>Relation</cite> prefixed to
      D’Anville’s Atlas, p. 11; <cite>Alphabetum Tibetanum</cite>, 454; and <cite>Kircher, China
      Illustrata</cite>, p. 65.)</p>

    <p>Since the first edition was published, Mr. Ney Elias has traversed the
      region in question from east to west; and I learn from him that at Kobdo
      he found the most usual name for that town among Mongols, Kalmaks, and
      Russians to be <span class="smcap">Sankin</span>-hoto. He had not then thought of connecting this name
      with Chinghin-talas, and has therefore no information as to its origin
      or the extent of its application. But he remarks that Polo’s bearing of
      between north and north-west, if understood to be <em>from Kamul</em>, would point
      exactly to Kobdo. He also calls attention to the Lake <em>Sankin</em>-dalai,
      to the north-east of Uliasut’ai, of which Atkinson gives a sketch. The
      recurrence of this name over so wide a tract may have something to do with
      the Chinghin-talas of Polo. But we must still wait for further light.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>[“Supposing that M. Polo mentions this place on his way from Sha-chow to
      Su-chow, it is natural to think that it is <em>Chi-kin-talas</em>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘Chi-kin
      plain’ or valley; Chi-kin was the name of a lake, called so even now, and
      of a defile, which received its name from the lake. The latter is on the
      way from Kia-yü kwan to Ansi chow.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 7.) “<em>Chikin</em>, or
      more correctly <em>Chigin</em>, is a Mongol word meaning ‘ear.’” (<i>Ibid.</i>) Palladius
      (p. 8) adds: “The Chinese accounts of Chi-kin are not in contradiction
      to the statements given by M. Polo regarding the same subject; but when
      the distances are taken into consideration, a serious difficulty arises;
      Chi-kin is two hundred and fifty or sixty <i>li</i> distant from Su-chow,
      whilst, according to M. Polo’s statement, ten days are necessary to cross
      this distance. One of the three following explanations of this discrepancy
      must be admitted: either Chingintalas is not Chi-kin, or the traveller’s
      memory failed, or, lastly, an error crept into the number of days’ journey.
      The two last suppositions I consider the most probable; the more so that
      similar difficulties occur several times in Marco Polo’s narrative.” (<i>L.c.</i>
      p. 8.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      5.</a>—Here the G. Text adds: “<i lang="fr">Et je meisme le vi</i>,” intimating, I
      conceive, his having himself seen specimens of the asbestos—not to his
      having been at the place.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XLII16" href="#NoteAnchor_XLII16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—The story of the Salamander passing unhurt through fire is at
      least as old as Aristotle. But I cannot tell when the fable arose that
      asbestos was a substance derived from the animal. This belief, however,
      was general in the Middle Ages, both in Asia and Europe. “The fable of
      the Salamander,” says Sir Thomas Browne, “hath been much promoted by
      stories of incombustible napkins and textures which endure the fire, whose
      materials are called by the name of Salamander’s wool, which many, too
      literally apprehending, conceive some investing part or integument of the
      Salamander.... Nor is this Salamander’s wool desumed from any animal, but a
      mineral substance, metaphorically so called for this received opinion.”</p>

    <p>Those who knew that the Salamander was a lizard-like animal were indeed
      perplexed as to its woolly coat. Thus the Cardinal de Vitry is fain to say
      the creature “<em>profert ex cute</em> quasi quamdam lanam <em>de quâ zonae contextae
      comburi non possunt igne.</em>” A Bestiary, published by Cahier and Martin,
      says of it: “<i lang="fr">De lui naist une cose qui n’est ne soie ne lin ne laine.</i>”
      Jerome Cardan looked in vain, he says, for hair on the Salamander! Albertus
      Magnus calls the incombustible fibre <em>pluma Salamandri</em>; and accordingly
      Bold Bauduin de Sebourc finds the Salamander in the Terrestrial Paradise
      <em>a kind of bird covered with the whitest plumage</em>; of this he takes some,
      which he gets woven into a cloth; this he presents to the Pope, and the
      Pontiff applies it to the purpose mentioned in the text, viz. to cover the
      holy napkin of St. Veronica.</p>

    <p>Gervase of Tilbury writes: “I saw, when lately at Rome, a broad strap
      of Salamander skin, like a girdle for the loins, which had been brought
      thither by Cardinal Peter of Capua. When it had become somewhat soiled by
      use, I myself saw it cleaned perfectly, and without receiving harm, by
      being put in the fire.”</p>

    <p>In Persian the creature is called <em>Samandar</em>, <em>Samandal</em>, etc., and some
      derive the word from <em>Sam</em>, “fire,” and <em>Andar</em>, “within.” Doubtless it is
      a corruption of the Greek <span lang="el">Σαλαμάνδρα</span>, whatever be the origin of
      that. Bakui says the animal is found at Ghur, near Herat, and is <em>like a
      mouse</em>. Another author, quoted by D’Herbelot, says it is <em>like a marten</em>.</p>

    <p>[Sir T. Douglas Forsyth, in his <cite>Introductory Remarks</cite> to Prjevalsky’s
      <cite>Travels to Lob-nor</cite> (p. 20), at Aksu says: “The asbestos mentioned by
      Marco Polo as a utilized product of this region is not even so known in
      this country.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>✛ Interesting details regarding the fabrication of cloth and paper from
      amianth or asbestos are contained in a report presented to the French
      Institute by M. Sage (<cite>Mém. Ac. Sciences</cite>, 2e Sem., 1806, p. 102), of which
      large extracts are given in the <cite>Diction. général des Tissus</cite>, par M.
      Bezon, 2e éd. vol. ii. Lyon, 1859, p. 5. He mentions that a <em>Sudarium</em> of
      this material is still shown at the Vatican; we hope it is the cover which
      Kúblái sent.</p>

    <p>[This hope is not to be realized. Mgr. Duchesne, of the Institut de France,
      writes to me from Rome, from information derived from the keepers of the
      Vatican Museum, that there is no sudarium from the Great Khan, that indeed
      part of a sudarium made of asbestos is shown (under glass) in this Museum,
      about 20 inches long, but it is ancient, and was found in a Pagan tomb of
      the Appian Way.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>

    <p>M. Sage exhibited incombustible paper made from this material, and had
      himself seen a small furnace of Chinese origin made from it. Madame
      Perpenté, an Italian lady, who experimented much with asbestos, found that
      from a crude mass of that substance threads could be elicited which were
      ten times the length of the mass itself, and were indeed sometimes several
      metres in length, the fibres seeming to be involved, like silk in a cocoon.
      Her process of preparation was much like that described by Marco. She
      succeeded in carding and reeling the material, made gloves and the like, as
      well as paper, from it, and sent to the Institute a work printed on such paper.</p>

    <p>The Rev. A. Williamson mentions asbestos as found in Shantung. The natives
      use it for making stoves, crucibles, and so forth.</p>

      but there is a great variety in the readings, and several texts have a
      marked difference between the name of the province and that of the city,
      whilst others give them as the same. I have adopted those to which the
      resultants of the readings of the best texts seem to point, viz. <em>Succiur</em>
      and <em>Succiu</em>, though with considerable doubt whether they should not be
      identical. Pauthier declares that <em>Suctur</em>, which is the reading of his
      favourite MS., is the exact pronunciation, after the vulgar Mongol manner,
      of <em>Suh-chau-lu</em>, the <em>Lu</em> or circuit of Suhchau; whilst Neumann says that
      the Northern Chinese constantly add an euphonic particle <em>or</em> to the end of
      words. I confess to little faith in such refinements, when no evidence is
      produced.</p>

    <p>[Suhchau had been devastated and its inhabitants massacred by Chinghiz Khan

    <p>Suhchau is called by Rashiduddin, and by Shah Rukh’s ambassadors, <em>Sukchú</em>,
      in exact correspondence with the reading we have adopted for the name of
      the city, whilst the Russian Envoy Boikoff, in the 17th century, calls it
      “<em>Suktsey</em>, where the rhubarb grows”; and Anthony Jenkinson, in Hakluyt,
      by a slight metathesis, <em>Sowchick</em>. Suhchau lies just within the extreme
      north-west angle of the Great Wall. It was at Suhchau that Benedict Goës

      mountains. The central line of its distribution appears to be the high
      range dividing the head waters of the Hwang-Ho, Yalung, and Min-Kiang. The
      chief markets are Siningfu (see <a href="#CHAPTER_LVII1">ch. lvii.</a>), and Kwan-Kian in Szechwan. In

      (<cite>Churchill’s Collect.</cite>, Bk. III. ch. v. 365.) It is said that when
      Chinghiz Khan was pillaging Tangut, the only things his minister, Yeh-lü
      Ch’u-ts’ai, would take as his share of the booty were a few Chinese books
      and a supply of rhubarb, with which he saved the lives of a great number
      of Mongols, when, a short time after, an epidemic broke out in the army.”
      (<cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, I. 372.—<cite>Rockhill, Rubruck</cite>, p. 193, note.)</p>

    <p>“With respect to rhubarb ... the <em>Suchowchi</em> also makes the remark, that
      the best rhubarb, with golden flowers in the breaking, is gathered in this
      province (district of <em>Shan-tan</em>), and that it is equally beneficial to
      men and beasts, preserving them from the pernicious effects of the heat.”

      4.</a>—<em>Erba</em> is the title applied to the poisonous growth, which may be
      either “plant” or “grass.” It is not unlikely that it was a plant akin to
      the <i>Andromeda ovalifolia</i>, the tradition of the poisonous character of
      which prevails everywhere along the Himalaya from Nepal to the Indus.</p>

    <p>It is notorious for poisoning sheep and goats at Simla and other hill
      sanitaria; and Dr. Cleghorn notes the same circumstance regarding it that
      Polo heard of the plant in Tangut, viz. that its effects on flocks imported
      from the plains are highly injurious, whilst those of the hills do not
      appear to suffer, probably because they shun the young leaves, which alone
      are deleterious. Mr. Marsh attests the like fact regarding <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>the <i>Kalmia
      angustifolia</i> of New England, a plant of the same order (<i>Ericaceae</i>).
      Sheep bred where it abounds almost always avoid browsing on its leaves,
      whilst those brought from districts where it is unknown feed upon it and
      are poisoned.</p>

    <p>Firishta, quoting from the <cite>Zafar-Námah</cite>, says: “On the road from Kashmir
      towards Tibet there is a plain on which no other vegetable grows but
      a poisonous grass that destroys all the cattle that taste of it, and
      therefore no horsemen venture to travel that route.” And Abbé Desgodins,
      writing from E. Tibet, mentions that sheep and goats are poisoned by
      rhododendron leaves. (<cite>Dr. Hugh Cleghorn</cite> in <cite>J. Agricultural and Hortic.
      Society of India</cite>, XIV. part 4; <cite>Marsh’s Man and Nature</cite>, p. 40; <cite>Brigg’s
      Firishta</cite>, IV. 449; <cite>Bul. de la Soc. de Géog.</cite> 1873, I. 333.)</p>

    <p>[“This poisonous plant seems to be the <i>Stipa inebrians</i> described by the
      late Dr. Hance in the <cite>Journal of Bot.</cite> 1876, p. 211, from specimens sent
      to me by Belgian Missionaries from the Ala Shan Mountains, west of the
      Yellow River.” (<cite>Bretschneider, Hist. of Bot. Disc.</cite> I. p. 5.)</p>

    <p>“M. Polo notices that the cattle not indigenous to the province lose
      their hoofs in the Suh-chau Mountains; but that is probably not on
      account of some poisonous grass, but in consequence of the stony ground.”

  <div class="subh4">Of the City of Campichu.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Campichu</span> is also a city of Tangut, and a very great and noble one. Indeed
    it is the capital and place of government of the whole province of
    Tangut.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLIV11" href="#Note_XLIV11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> The people are Idolaters, Saracens, and Christians, and
    the latter have three very fine churches in the city, whilst the Idolaters
    have many minsters and abbeys after their fashion. In these they have an
    enormous number of idols, both small and great, certain of the latter
    being a good ten paces in stature; some of them being of wood, others of
    clay, and others yet of stone. They are all highly polished, and then
    covered with gold. The great idols of which I speak lie at length.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLIV12" href="#Note_XLIV12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    And round about them there are other figures of considerable size, as if
    adoring and paying homage before them.</p>

  <p>Now, as I have not yet given you particulars about the customs of these
    Idolaters, I will proceed to tell you about them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>

  <p>You must know that there are among them certain religious recluses who
    lead a more virtuous life than the rest. These abstain from all lechery,
    though they do not indeed regard it as a deadly sin; howbeit if any one
    sin against nature they condemn him to death. They have an Ecclesiastical
    Calendar as we have; and there are five days in the month that they observe
    particularly; and on these five days they would on no account either
    slaughter any animal or eat flesh meat. On those days, moreover, they
    observe much greater abstinence altogether than on other days.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLIV13" href="#Note_XLIV13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>Among these people a man may take thirty wives, more or less, if he can but
    afford to do so, each having wives in proportion to his wealth and means;
    but the first wife is always held in highest consideration. The men endow
    their wives with cattle, slaves, and money, according to their ability. And
    if a man dislikes any one of his wives, he just turns her off and takes
    another. They take to wife their cousins and their fathers’ widows (always
    excepting the man’s own mother), holding to be no sin many things that we
    think grievous sins, and, in short, they live like beasts.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLIV14" href="#Note_XLIV14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>Messer Maffeo and Messer Marco Polo dwelt a whole year in this city when on
    a mission.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLIV15" href="#Note_XLIV15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>Now we will leave this and tell you about other provinces towards the
    north, for we are going to take you a sixty days’ journey in that direction.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XLIV11" href="#NoteAnchor_XLIV11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Campichiu is undoubtedly Kanchau, which was at this time, as
      Pauthier tells us, the chief city of the administration of <em>Kansuh</em>,
      corresponding to Polo’s Tangut. <em>Kansuh</em> itself is a name compounded of the
      names of the two cities <em>Kan</em>-chau and <em>Suh</em>-chau.</p>

    <p>[Kanchau fell under the Tangut dominion in 1208. (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 10.)
      The Musulmans mentioned by Polo at Shachau and Kanchau probably came from
      Khotan.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The difficulties that have been made about the form of the name
      <em>Campiciou</em>, etc., in Polo, and the attempts to explain these, are probably
      alike futile. Quatremère writes the Persian form of the name after
      Abdurrazzak as <em>Kamtcheou</em>, but I see that Erdmann <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>writes it after Rashid,
      I presume on good grounds, as <em>Ckamidschu</em>, <i>i.e.</i> <em>Ḳamiju</em> or <em>Ḳamichu</em>. And
      that this <em>was</em> the Western pronunciation of the name is shown by the form
      which Pegolotti uses, <em>Camexu</em>, <i>i.e.</i> Camechu. The <em>p</em> in Polo’s spelling is
      probably only a superfluous letter, as in the occasional old spelling of
      <em>dampnum</em>, <em>contempnere</em>, <em>hympnus</em>, <em>tirampnus</em>, <em>sompnour</em>, <em>Dampne Deu</em>.
      In fact, Marignolli writes Polo’s <em>Quinsai</em> as <em>Campsay</em>.</p>

    <p>It is worthy of notice that though Ramusio’s text prints the names of
      these two cities as <em>Succuir</em> and <em>Campion</em>, his own pronunciation of them
      appears to have been quite well understood by the Persian traveller Hajji
      Mahomed, for it is perfectly clear that the latter recognized in these
      names Suhchau and Kanchau. (See <cite>Ram.</cite> II. f. 14v.) The second volume of
      the <cite>Navigationi</cite>, containing Polo, was published after Ramusio’s death,
      and it is possible that the names as he himself read them were more correct
      (<i>e.g.</i> <cite>Succiur, Campjou</cite>).</p>

      <div class="caption">Colossal Figure, Buddha entering Nirvana.<br />
        <span class="antiqua" lang="fr">“Et si voz di qu’il ont de ydres que sunt grant dix pas.... Ceste grant
        ydres gigent.” ...</span></div>
    </div>

    <p><a id="Note_XLIV12" href="#NoteAnchor_XLIV12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      2.</a>—This is the meaning of the phrase in the G.&nbsp;T.: “<em>Ceste grande
      ydre</em> gigent,” as may be seen from Ramusio’s <i>giaciono distesi</i>. Lazari
      renders the former expression, “giganteggia un idolo,” etc., a phrase
      very unlike Polo. The circumstance is interesting, because this recumbent
      Colossus at Kanchau is mentioned both by Hajji Mahomed and by Shah Rukh’s
      people. The latter say: “In this city of Kanchú there is an Idol-Temple 500
      cubits square. In the middle is an idol lying at length which measures 50
      paces. The sole of the foot is nine paces long, and the instep is 21 cubits
      in girth. Behind this image and overhead are other idols of a cubit (?) in
      height, besides figures of <em>Bakshis</em> as large as life. The action of all
      is hit off so admirably that you would think they were alive.” These great
      recumbent figures are favourites in Buddhist countries still, <i>e.g.</i> in Siam,
      Burma, and Ceylon. They symbolise Sakya Buddha entering <em>Nirvána</em>. Such a
      recumbent figure, perhaps the prototype of these, was seen by Hiuen Tsang
      in a Vihara close to the Sál Grove at Kusinágara, where Sakya entered that
      state, <i>i.e.</i> died. The stature of Buddha was, we are told, 12 cubits; but
      Brahma, Indra, and the other gods vainly tried to compute his dimensions.
      Some such rude metaphor is probably embodied in these large images. I have
      described one 69 feet long in Burma (represented in the cut), but others
      exist of much greater size, though probably none equal to that which Hiuen
      Tsang, in the 7th century, saw near Bamian, which was 1000 feet in length!
      I have heard of but one such image remaining in India, viz. in one of the
      caves at Dhamnár in Málwa. This is 15 feet long, and is popularly known as
      “Bhim’s Baby.” (<cite>Cathay</cite>, etc., pp. cciii., ccxviii.; <cite>Mission to Ava</cite>, p.
      52; <cite>V. et V. de H. T.</cite>, p. 374: <cite>Cunningham’s Archæl. Reports</cite>, ii. 274;
      <cite>Tod</cite>, ii. 273.)</p>

    <p>[“The temple, in which M. Polo saw an idol of Buddha, represented in a
      lying position, is evidently <em>Wo-fo-sze</em>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘Monastery of the lying
      Buddha.’ It was built in 1103 by a Tangut queen, to place there three idols
      representing Buddha in this posture, which have since been found in the
      ground on this very spot.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 10.)</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

    <p>Rubruck (p. 144) says: “A Nestorian, who had come from Cathay told me
      that in that country there is an idol so big that it can be seen from two
      days off.” Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 144, <i>note</i>) writes: “The largest
      stone image I have seen is in a cave temple at Yung-kán, about 10 miles
      north-west of Ta t’ung Fu in Shan-si. Père Gerbillon says the Emperor
      K’ang-hsi measured it himself and found it to be 57 <em>chih</em> high (61 feet).
      (<cite>Duhalde, Description</cite>, IV. 352.) I have seen another colossal statue
      in a cave near Pinchou in north-west Shan-si, and there is another about
      45 miles south of Ning-hsia Fu, near the left bank of the Yellow River.
      (<cite>Rockhill, Land of the Lamas</cite>, 26, and <cite>Diary</cite>, 47.) The great recumbent
      figure of the ‘Sleeping Buddha’ in the Wo Fo ssŭ, near Peking, is of clay.”</p>

    <p>King Haython (Brosset’s ed. p. 181) mentions the statue in clay, of an
      extraordinary height, of a God (Buddha) aged 3040 years, who is to live
      370,000 years more, when he will be superseded by another god called
      <em>Madri</em> (Maitreya).—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XLIV13" href="#NoteAnchor_XLIV13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Marco is now speaking of the Lamas, or clergy of Tibetan Buddhism.
      The customs mentioned have varied in details, both locally and with the
      changes that the system has passed through in the course of time.</p>

    <p>The institutes of ancient Buddhism set apart the days of new and full moon
      to be observed by the <em>Sramanas</em> or monks, by fasting, confession, and
      listening to the reading of the law. It became usual for the laity to take
      part in the observance, and the number of days was increased to three and
      then to four, whilst Hiuen Tsang himself speaks of “the six fasts of every
      month,” and a Chinese authority quoted by Julien gives the days as the 8th,
      14th, 15th, 23rd, 29th, and 30th. Fahian says that in Ceylon preaching took
      place on the 8th, 14th, and 15th days of the month. Four <span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>is the number now
      most general amongst Buddhist nations, and the days may be regarded as a
      kind of Buddhist Sabbath. In the southern countries and in Nepal they occur
      at the moon’s changes. In Tibet and among the Mongol Buddhists they are
      not at equal intervals, though I find the actual days differently stated
      by different authorities. Pallas says the Mongols observed the 13th, 14th,
      and 15th, the three days being brought together, he thought, on account
      of the distance many Lamas had to travel to the temple—just as in some
      Scotch country parishes they used to give two sermons in one service for
      like reason! Koeppen, to whose work this note is much indebted, says the
      Tibetan days are the 14th, 15th, 29th, 30th, and adds as to the manner of
      observance: “On these days, by rule, among the Lamas, nothing should be
      tasted but farinaceous food and tea; the very devout refrain from all food
      from sunrise to sunset. The Temples are decorated, and the altar tables
      set out with the holy symbols, with tapers, and with dishes containing
      offerings in corn, meal, tea, butter, etc., and especially with small
      pyramids of dough, or of rice or clay, and accompanied by much burning of
      incense-sticks. The service performed by the priests is more solemn, the
      music louder and more exciting, than usual. The laity make their offerings,
      tell their beads, and repeat <em>Om mani padma hom</em>,” etc. In the <em>concordat</em>
      that took place between the Dalai-Lama and the Altun Khaghan, on the
      reconversion of the Mongols to Buddhism in the 16th century, one of the
      articles was the entire prohibition of hunting and the slaughter of animals
      on the monthly fast days. The practice varies much, however, even in Tibet,
      with different provinces and sects—a variation which the Ramusian text of
      Polo implies in these words: “For five days, or <em>four days</em>, or <em>three</em> in
      each month, they shed no blood,” etc.</p>

    <p>In Burma the Worship Day, as it is usually called by Europeans, is a very
      gay scene, the women flocking to the pagodas in their brightest attire.

    <p><a id="Note_XLV11" href="#NoteAnchor_XLV11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Deguignes says that <span class="smcap">Yetsina</span> is found in a Chinese Map of Tartary of
      the Mongol era, and this is confirmed by Pauthier, who reads it <em>Itsinai</em>,
      and adds that the text of the Map names it as one of the seven <em>Lu</em> or
      Circuits of the Province of Kansuh (or Tangut). Indeed, in D’Anville’s
      Atlas we find a river called <em>Etsina Pira</em>, running northward from Kanchau,
      and a little below the 41st parallel joining <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>another from Suhchau. Beyond
      the junction is a town called <em>Hoa-tsiang</em>, which probably represents
      Etzina. Yetsina is also mentioned in Gaubil’s History of Chinghiz as
      taken by that conqueror in 1226, on his last campaign against Tangut.
      This capture would also seem from Pétis de la Croix to be mentioned by
      Rashiduddin. Gaubil says the Chinese Geography places Yetsina north of
      Kanchau and north-east of Suhchau, at a distance of 120 leagues from
      Kanchau, but observes that this is certainly too great. (<cite>Gaubil</cite>, p. 49.)</p>

    <p>[I believe there can be no doubt that Etzina must be looked for on the
      river <em>Hei-shui</em>, called <em>Etsina</em> by the Mongols, east of Suhchau. This
      river empties its waters into the two lakes Soho-omo and Sopo-omo. Etzina
      would have been therefore situated on the river on the border of the
      Desert, at the top of a triangle whose bases would be Suhchau and Kanchau.
      This river was once part of the frontier of the kingdom of Tangut. (Cf.
      <cite>Devéria, Notes d’épigraphie mongolo-chinoise</cite>, p. 4.) Reclus (<cite>Géog.
      Univ., Asie Orientale</cite>, p. 159) says: “To the east [of Hami], beyond the
      Chukur Gobi, are to be found also some permanent villages and the remains
      of cities. One of them is perhaps the ‘cité d’Etzina’ of which Marco Polo
      speaks, and the name is to be found in that of the river Az-sind.”</p>

    <p>“Through Kanchau was the shortest, and most direct and convenient road to
      <em>I-tsi-nay</em>.... I-tsi-nay, or <em>Echiné</em>, is properly the name of a lake.
      Khubilaï, disquieted by his factious relatives on the north, established
      a military post near lake I-tsi-nay, and built a town, or a fort on the
      south-western shore of this lake. The name of I-tsi-nay appears from that
      time; it does not occur in the chronicle of the Tangut kingdom; the lake
      had then another name. Vestiges of the town are seen to this day; the
      buildings were of large dimensions, and some of them were very fine. In
      Marco Polo’s time there existed a direct route from I-tsi-nay to Karakorum;
      traces of this road are still noticeable, but it is no more used. This
      circumstance, <i>i.e.</i> the existence of a road from I-tsi-nay to Karakorum,
      probably led Marco Polo to make an excursion (a mental one, I suppose) to
      the residence of the Khans in Northern Mongolia.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> pp.

      3.</a>—The Wild Ass of Mongolia is the <em>Dshiggetai</em> of Pallas (<i>Asinus
      hemionus</i> of Gray), and identical with the Tibetan <em>Kyang</em> of Moorcroft and
      Trans-Himalayan sportsmen. It differs, according to Blyth, only in shades
      of colour and unimportant markings from the <em>Ghor Khar</em> of Western India
      and the Persian Deserts, the <em>Kulan</em> of Turkestan, which Marco has spoken
      of in a previous passage (<em>suprà</em>, ch. xvi.; <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite> XXVIII. 229
      <i>seqq.</i>). There is a fine Kyang in the Zoological Gardens, whose portrait,
      after Wolf, is given here. But Mr. Ney Elias says of this animal that he
      has little of the aspect of his nomadic brethren. [The wild ass (Tibetan
      <em>Kyang</em>, Mongol <em>Holu</em> or <em>Hulan</em>) is called by the Chinese <em>yeh ma</em>, “wild
      horse,” though “every one admits that it is an ass, and should be called
      <em>yeh lo-tzŭ</em>.” (<cite>Rockhill, Land of the Lamas</cite>, 151, note.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[Captain Younghusband (1886) saw in the Altaï Mountains “considerable
      numbers of wild asses, which appeared to be perfectly similar to the Kyang
      of Ladak and Tibet, and wild horses too—the <i>Equus Prejevalskii</i>—roaming
      about these great open plains.” (<cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> X. 1888, p. 495.) Dr.
      Sven Hedin says the <em>habitat</em> of the <em>Kulan</em> is the heights of Tibet as
      well as the valley of the Tarim; it looks like a mule with the mane and
      tail of an ass, but shorter ears, longer than those of a horse; he gives a
      picture of it.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the City of Caracoron.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Caracoron</span> is a city of some three miles in compass. [It is surrounded by a
    strong earthen rampart, for stone is scarce there. And beside it there is a
    great citadel wherein is a fine palace in which the Governor resides.] ’Tis
    the first city that the Tartars possessed after they issued from their own
    country. And now I will tell you all about how they first acquired dominion
    and spread over the world.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLVI11" href="#Note_XLVI11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>Originally the Tartars<a id="NoteAnchor_XLVI12" href="#Note_XLVI12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> dwelt in the north on the borders of
    <span class="smcap">Chorcha</span>.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLVI13" href="#Note_XLVI13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> Their country was one of great plains; and there were no
    towns or villages in it, but excellent pasture-lands, with great rivers and
    many sheets of water; in fact it was a very fine and extensive region. But
    there was no sovereign in the land. They did, however, pay tax and tribute
    to a great prince who was called in their tongue <span class="smcap">Unc Can</span>, the same that we
    call Prester John, him in fact about whose great dominion all the world
    talks.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLVI14" href="#Note_XLVI14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> The tribute he had of them was one beast out of every ten,
    and also a tithe of all their other gear.</p>

  <p>Now it came to pass that the Tartars multiplied exceedingly. And when
    Prester John saw how great a people they had become, he began to fear that
    he should have trouble from them. So he made a scheme to distribute them
    over sundry countries, and sent one of his Barons to carry this out. When
    the Tartars became aware of this they took it much amiss, and with one
    consent they left their country and went off across a desert to a distant
    region towards the north, where Prester John could not get at them to annoy
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>them. Thus they revolted from his authority and paid him tribute no longer.
    And so things continued for a time.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XLVI11" href="#NoteAnchor_XLVI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—<span class="smcap">Karákorum</span>, near the upper course of the River Orkhon, is said
      by Chinese authors to have been founded by Búkú Khan of the Hoei-Hu or
      Uigúrs, in the 8th century. In the days of Chinghiz, we are told that
      it was the headquarters of his ally, and afterwards enemy, Togrul Wang
      Khan, the Prester John of Polo. [“The name of this famous city is Mongol,
      <em>Kara</em>, ‘black,’ and <em>Kuren</em>, ‘a camp,’ or properly ‘pailing.’” It was
      founded in 1235 by Okkodai, who called it Ordu Balik, or “the City of the
      Ordu,” otherwise “The Royal City.” Mohammedan authors say it took its name
      of Karákorum from the mountains to the south of it, in which the Orkhon
      had its source. (<cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, ii. 64.) The Chinese mention a range of
      mountains from which the Orkhon flows, called <em>Wu-tê kien shan</em>. (<cite>T’ang
      shu</cite>, bk. 43<i>b</i>.) Probably these are the same. Rashiduddin speaks of a tribe
      of Utikien Uigúrs living in this country. (<cite>Bretschneider, Med. Geog.</cite>
      191; <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, i. 437; <cite>Rockhill, Rubruck</cite>, 220, note.)—Karákorum was
      called by the Chinese <em>Ho-lin</em> and was chosen by Chinghiz, in 1206, as his
      capital; the full name of it, <em>Ha-la Ho-lin</em>, was derived from a river
      to the west. (<cite>Yuen shi</cite>, ch. lviii.) Gaubil (<cite>Holin</cite>, p. 10) says that
      the river, called in his days in Tartar <em>Karoha</em>, was, at the time of the
      Mongol Emperors, named by the Chinese <em>Ha-la Ho-lin</em>, in Tartar language
      <em>Ka la Ko lin</em>, or <em>Cara korin</em>, or <em>Kara Koran</em>. In the spring of 1235,
      Okkodai had a wall raised round Ho-lin and a palace called <em>Wang an</em>, built
      inside the city. (<cite>Gaubil, Gentchiscan</cite>, 89.) After the death of Kúblái,
      <em>Ho-lin</em> was altered into <em>Ho-Ning</em>, and, in 1320, the name of the province
      was changed into <em>Ling-pé</em> (mountainous north, <i>i.e.</i> the <em>Yin-shan</em> chain,
      separating China Proper from Mongolia). In 1256, Mangu Kaan decided to
      transfer the seat of government to Kaipingfu, or Shangtu, near the present
      Dolonnor, north of Peking. (<em>Suprà</em> in Prologue, <a href="#Note_XIIIp1">ch. xiii. note 1</a>.) In
      1260, Kúblái transferred his capital to <em>Ta-Tu</em> (Peking).</p>

    <p>Plano Carpini (1246) is the first Western traveller to mention it by name
      which he writes <em>Caracoron</em>; he visited the Sira Orda, at half a day’s
      journey from Karákorum, where Okkodai used to pass the summer; it was
      situated at a place Ormektua. (<cite>Rockhill, Rubruck</cite>, 21, 111.) Rubruquis
      (1253) visited the city itself; the following is his account of it: “As
      regards the city of Caracoron, you must understand that if you set aside
      the Kaan’s own Palace, it is not as good as the Borough of St. Denis; and
      as for the Palace, the Abbey of St. Denis is worth ten of it! There are
      two streets in the town; one of which is occupied by the Saracens, and in
      that is the marketplace. The other street is occupied by the Cathayans, who
      are all craftsmen. Besides these two streets there are some great palaces
      occupied by the court secretaries. There are also twelve idol temples
      belonging to different nations, two Mahummeries in which the Law of Mahomet
      is preached, and one church of the Christians at the extremity of the town.
      The town is enclosed by a mud-wall and has four gates. At the east gate
      they sell millet and other corn, but the supply is scanty; at the west
      gate they sell rams and goats; at the south gate oxen and waggons; at the
      north gate horses.... Mangu Kaan has a great Court beside the Town Rampart,
      which is enclosed by a brick wall, just like our priories. Inside there is
      a big palace, within which he holds a drinking-bout twice a year; ... there
      are also a number of long buildings like granges, in which are kept his
      treasures and his stores of victual” (345–6; 334).</p>

    <p>Where was Karákorum situated?</p>

    <p>The Archimandrite Palladius is very prudent (<i>l.c.</i> p. 11): “Everything that
      the studious Chinese authors could gather and say of the situation of
      Karakhorum is collected in two Chinese works, <cite>Lo fung low wen kao</cite> (1849),
      and <cite>Mungku yew mu ki</cite> (<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>1859). However, no positive conclusion can be
      derived from these researches, chiefly in consequence of the absence of a
      tolerably correct map of Northern Mongolia.”</p>

    <p>Abel Rémusat (<cite>Mém. sur Géog. Asie Centrale</cite>, p. 20) made a confusion
      between Karábalgasun and Karákorum which has misled most writers after him.</p>

    <p>Sir Henry Yule says: “The evidence adduced in Abel Rémusat’s paper on
      Karákorum (<cite>Mém. de l’Acad. R. des Insc.</cite> VII. 288) establishes the
      site on the north bank of the Orkhon, and about five days’ journey above
      the confluence of the Orkhon and Tula. But as we have only a very loose
      knowledge of these rivers, it is impossible to assign the geographical
      position with accuracy. Nor is it likely that ruins exist beyond an outline
      perhaps of the Kaan’s Palace walls.”</p>

    <p>In the <cite>Geographical Magazine</cite> for July, 1874 (p. 137), Sir Henry Yule
      has been enabled, by the kind aid of Madame Fedtchenko in supplying a
      translation from the Russian, to give some account of Mr. Paderin’s visit
      to the place, in the summer of 1873, along with a sketch-map.</p>

    <p>“The site visited by Mr. Paderin is shown, by the particulars stated in
      that paper, to be sufficiently identified with Karákorum. It is precisely
      that which Rémusat indicated, and which bears in the Jesuit maps, as
      published by D’Anville, the name of <em>Talarho Hara Palhassoun</em> (<i>i.e.</i> Kará
      Balghásun), standing 4 or 5 miles from the left bank of the Orkhon, in
      lat. (by the Jesuit Tables) 47° 32′ 24″. It is now known as Kara-Khărăm
      (Rampart) or Kara Balghasun (city). The remains consist of a quadrangular
      rampart of mud and sun-dried brick, of about 500 paces to the side, and now
      about 9 feet high, with traces of a higher tower, and of an inner rampart
      parallel to the other. But these remains probably appertain to the city as
      re-occupied by the descendants of the Yuen in the end of the 14th century,
      after their expulsion from China.”</p>

    <p>Dr. Bretschneider (<cite>Med. Res.</cite> I. p. 123) rightly observes: “It seems,
      however, that Paderin is mistaken in his supposition. At least it does
      not agree with the position assigned to the ancient Mongol residence in
      the Mongol annals <em>Erdenin erikhe</em>, translated into Russian, in 1883, by
      Professor Pozdneiev. It is there positively stated (p. 110, note 2) that
      the monastery of <em>Erdenidsu</em>, founded in 1585, was erected on the ruins of
      that city, which once had been built by order of Ogotai Khan, and where
      he had established his residence; and where, after the expulsion of the
      Mongols from China, Toghon Temur again had fixed the Mongol court. This vast
      monastery still exists, one English mile, or more, east of the Orkhon.
      It has even been astronomically determined by the Jesuit missionaries,
      and is marked on our maps of Mongolia. Pozdneiev, who visited the place
      in 1877, obligingly informs me that the square earthen wall surrounding
      the monastery of Erdenidsu, and measuring about an English mile in
      circumference, may well be the very wall of ancient Karákorum.”</p>

    <p>Recent researches have fully confirmed the belief that the Erdeni Tso,
      or Erdeni Chao, Monastery occupies the site of Karákorum, near the bank
      of the Orkhon, between this river and the Kokchin (old) Orkhon. (See map
      in <cite>Inscriptions de l’Orkhon</cite>, Helsingfors, 1892; a plan of the vicinity
      and of the Erdeni Tso is given (plate 36) in <cite>W. Radloff’s Atlas der
      Alterthümer der Mongolei</cite>, St. Pet., 1892.)</p>

    <p>According to a work of the 13th century quoted by the late Professor G.
      Devéria, the distance between the old capital of the Uighúr, Kara Balgasún,
      on the left bank of the Orkhon, north of Erdeni Tso, and the Ho-lin or
      Karákorum of the Mongols, would be 70 <i>li</i> (about 30 miles), and such
      is the space between Erdeni Tso and Kara Balgasún. M. Marcel Monnier
      (<cite>Itinéraires</cite>, p. 107) estimates the bird’s-eye distance from Erdeni Tso
      to Kara Balgasún at 33 kilom. (about 20½ miles). “When the brilliant epoch
      of the power of the Chinghizkhanides,” says Professor Axel Heikel, “was
      at an end, the city of Karákorum fell into oblivion, and towards the year
      1590 was founded, in the centre of this historically celebrated region of
      the Orkhon, the most ancient of Buddhist monasteries of Mongolia, this of
      Erdeni Tso [Erdeni Chao]. It was built, according to a Mongol chronicle, on
      the ruins of the town built by Okkodaï, son of Chinghiz Khan, that is to
      say, on the ancient Karákorum.” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>(<cite>Inscriptions de l’Orkhon</cite>.) So Professor
      Heikel, like Professor Pozdneiev, concludes that Erdeni Tso was built on
      the site of Karákorum and cannot be mistaken for Karabalgásun. Indeed it is
      highly probable that one of the walls of the actual convent belonged to the
      old Mongol capital. The travels and researches by expeditions from Finland
      and Russia have made these questions pretty clear. Some most interesting
      inscriptions have been brought home and have been studied by a number of
      Orientalists: G. Schlegel, O. Donner, G. Devéria, Vasiliev, G. von der
      Gabelentz, Dr. Hirth, G. Huth, E. H. Parker, W. Bang, etc., and especially
      Professor Vilh. Thomsen, of Copenhagen, who deciphered them (<cite>Déchiffrement
      des Inscriptions de l’Orkhon et de l’Iénissei</cite>, Copenhague, 1894, 8vo;
      <cite>Inscriptions de l’Orkhon déchiffrées, par</cite> V. Thomsen, Helsingfors, 1894,
      8vo), and Professor W. Radloff of St. Petersburg (<cite>Atlas der Alterthümer
      der Mongolei</cite>, 1892–6, fol.; <cite>Die alttürkischen Inschriften der Mongolei</cite>,
      1894–7, etc.). There is an immense literature on these inscriptions, and
      for the bibliography, I must refer the reader to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span><cite>H. Cordier, Etudes
      Chinoises</cite> (1891–1894), Leide, 1895, 8vo. <i>Id.</i> (1895–1898), Leide, 1898, 8vo. The
      initiator of these discoveries was N. Iarindsev, of Irkutsk, who died at
      Barnaoul in 1894, and the first great expedition was started from Finland
      in 1890, under the guidance of Professor Axel Heikel. (<cite>Inscriptions de
      l’Orkhon recueillies par l’expédition finnoise, 1890, et publiées par la
      Société Finno-Ougrienne</cite>, Helsingfors, 1892, fol.) The Russian expedition
      left the following year, 1891, under the direction of the Academician W. Radloff.</p>

    </div>

    <p>M. Chaffanjon (<cite>Nouv. Archiv. des Missions Scient.</cite> IX., 1899, p. 81), in
      1895, does not appear to know that there is a difference between Kará Korum
      and Kará Balgásun, as he writes: “Forty kilometres south of Kara Korum <em>or</em>
      Kara Balgásun, the convent of Erdin Zoun.”</p>

    <p>A plan of Kara Balgásun is given (plate 27) in <cite>Radloff’s Atlas</cite>. See also
      <cite>Henri Cordier et Gaubil, Situation de Holin en Tartarie</cite>, Leide, 1893.</p>

    <p>In Rubruquis’s account of Karákorum there is one passage of great interest:
      “Then master William [Guillaume L’Orfèvre] had made for us an iron to make
      wafers ... he made also a silver box to put the body of Christ in, with
      relics in little cavities made in the sides of the box.” Now M. Marcel
      Monnier, who is one of the last, if not the last traveller who visited
      the region, tells me that he found in the large temple of Erdeni Tso an
      iron (the cast bore a Latin cross; had the wafer been Nestorian, the cross
      should have been Greek) and a silver box, which are very likely the objects
      mentioned by Rubruquis. It is a new proof of the identity of the sites of
      Erdeni Tso and Karákorum.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      2.</a>—[Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, 113, note) says: “The earliest date
      to which I have been able to trace back the name Tartar is <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 732. We
      find mention made in a Turkish inscription found on the river Orkhon and
      bearing that date, of the <em>Tokuz Tatar</em>, or ‘Nine (tribes of) Tatars,’ and
      of the <em>Otuz Tatar</em>, or ‘Thirty (tribes of) Tatars.’ It is probable that
      these tribes were then living between the Oguz or Uigúr Turks on the west,
      and the Kitan on the east. (<cite>Thomsen, Inscriptions de l’Orkhon</cite>, 98, 126,
      140.) Mr. Thos. Watters tells me that the Tartars are first mentioned by
      the Chinese in the period extending from <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 860 to 874; the earliest
      mention I have discovered, however, is under date of <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 880. (<cite>Wu tai
      shih</cite>, Bk. 4.) <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>We also read in the same work (Bk. 74, 2) that ‘The Ta-ta
      were a branch of the Mo-ho (the name the Nû-chēn Tartars bore during the
      Sui and T’ang periods: <cite>Ma Tuan-lin</cite>, Bk. 327, 5). They first lived to
      the north of the Kitan. Later on they were conquered by this people, when
      they scattered, a part becoming tributaries of the Kitan, another to the
      P’o-hai (a branch of the Mo-ho), while some bands took up their abode in
      the Yin Shan in Southern Mongolia, north of the provinces of Chih-li and
      Shan-si, and took the name of <em>Ta-ta</em>.’ In 981 the Chinese ambassador to
      the Prince of Kao-chang (Karakhodjo, some 20 miles south-east of Turfan)
      traversed the Ta-ta country. They then seem to have occupied the northern
      bend of the Yellow River. He gives the names of some nine tribes of Ta-ta
      living on either side of the river. He notes that their neighbours to the
      east were Kitan, and that for a long time they had been fighting them after
      the occupation of Kan-chou by the Uigúrs. (<cite>Ma Tuan-lin</cite>, Bk. 336, 12–14.)
      We may gather from this that these Tartars were already settled along the
      Yellow River and the Yin Shan (the valley in which is now the important
      frontier mart of Kwei-hua Ch’eng) at the beginning of the ninth century,
      for the Uigúrs, driven southward by the Kirghiz, first occupied Kan-chou in
      north-western Kan-suh, somewhere about <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 842.”]</p>

      that time called by the Chinese <em>Yuché</em> or <em>Niuché</em>, and by the Mongols
      <em>Churché</em>, or as it is in Sanang Setzen, <em>Jurchid</em>. The country in question
      is several times mentioned by Rashiduddin as Churché. The founders of the

    <p><a id="Note_XLVI14" href="#NoteAnchor_XLVI14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      4.</a>—The idea that a Christian potentate of enormous wealth and power,
      and bearing this title, ruled over vast tracts in the far East, was
      universal in Europe from the middle of the 12th to the end of the 13th
      century, after which time the Asiatic story seems gradually to have died
      away, whilst the Royal Presbyter was assigned to a locus in Abyssinia; the
      equivocal application of the term <em>India</em> to the East of Asia and the East
      of Africa facilitating this transfer. Indeed I have a suspicion, contrary
      to the view now generally taken, that the term may from the first have
      belonged to the Abyssinian Prince, though circumstances led to its being
      applied in another quarter for a time. It appears to me almost certain that
      the letter of Pope Alexander III., preserved by R. Hoveden, and written in
      1177 to the <cite>Magnificus Rex Indorum, Sacerdotum sanctissimus</cite>, was meant
      for the King of Abyssinia.</p>

    <p>Be that as it may, the inordinate report of Prester John’s magnificence
      became especially diffused from about the year 1165, when a letter full of
      the most extravagant details was circulated, which purported to have been
      addressed by this potentate to the Greek Emperor Manuel, the Roman Emperor
      Frederick, the Pope, and other Christian sovereigns. By the circulation
      of this letter, glaring fiction as it is, the idea of this Christian
      Conqueror was planted deep in the mind of Europe, and twined itself round
      every rumour of revolution in further Asia. Even when the din of the
      conquests of Chinghiz began to be audible in the West, he was invested with
      the character of a Christian King, and more or less confounded with the
      mysterious Prester John.</p>

    <p>The first notice of a conquering Asiatic potentate so styled had been
      brought to Europe by the Syrian Bishop of Gabala (<em>Jibal</em>, south of
      Laodicea in Northern Syria), who came, in 1145, to lay various grievances
      before Pope Eugene III. He reported that not long before a certain John,
      inhabiting the extreme East, king and Nestorian priest, and claiming
      descent from the Three Wise Kings, had made war on the <em>Samiard</em> Kings of
      the Medes and Persians, and had taken Ecbatana their capital. He was then
      proceeding to the deliverance of Jerusalem, but was stopped by the Tigris,
      which he could not cross, and compelled by disease in his host to retire.</p>

    <p>M. d’Avezac first showed to whom this account must apply, and the subject
      has more recently been set forth with great completeness and learning by
      Dr. Gustavus Oppert. The conqueror in question was the founder of Kara
      Khitai, which existed as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>a great Empire in Asia during the last two-thirds
      of the 12th century. This chief was a prince of the Khitan dynasty of
      Liao, who escaped with a body of followers from Northern China on the
      overthrow of that dynasty by the <em>Kin</em> or Niuchen about 1125. He is called
      by the Chinese historians Yeliu Tashi; by Abulghazi, Nuzi Taigri Ili;
      and by Rashiduddin, Nushi (or Fushi) Taifu. Being well received by the
      Uighúrs and other tribes west of the Desert who had been subject to the
      Khitan Empire, he gathered an army and commenced a course of conquest
      which eventually extended over Eastern and Western Turkestan, including
      Khwarizm, which became tributary to him. He took the title of <em>Gurkhan</em>,
      said to mean Universal or Suzerain Khan, and fixed at Bala Sagun, north of
      the Thian Shan, the capital of his Empire, which became known as <em>Kará</em>
      (Black) <em>Khitai</em>.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
      [The dynasty being named by the Chinese <em>Si-Liao</em>
      (Western Liao) lasted till it was destroyed in 1218.—H.&nbsp;C.] In 1141 he
      came to the aid of the King of Khwarizm against <em>Sanjar</em> the Seljukian
      sovereign of Persia (whence the <em>Samiard</em> of the Syrian Bishop), who had
      just taken Samarkand, and defeated that prince with great slaughter. Though
      the Gurkhan himself is not described to have extended his conquests into
      Persia, the King of Khwarizm followed up the victory by an invasion of that
      country, in which he plundered the treasury and cities of Sanjar.</p>

    <p>Admitting this Karacathayan prince to be the first conqueror (in Asia, at
      all events) to whom the name of Prester John was applied, it still remains
      obscure how that name arose. Oppert supposes that <em>Gurkhan</em> or <em>Kurkhan</em>,
      softened in West Turkish pronunciation into <em>Yurkan</em>, was confounded with
      <em>Yochanan</em> or <em>Johannes</em>; but he finds no evidence of the conqueror’s
      profession of Christianity except the fact, notable certainly, that the
      daughter of the last of his brief dynasty is recorded to have been a
      Christian. Indeed, D’Ohsson says that the first Gurkhan was a Buddhist,
      though on what authority is not clear. There seems a probability at least
      that it was an error in the original ascription of Christianity to the
      Karacathayan prince, which caused the confusions as to the identity of
      Prester John which appear in the next century, of which we shall presently
      speak. Leaving this doubtful point, it has been plausibly suggested that
      the title of Presbyter Johannes was connected with the legends of the
      immortality of John the Apostle (<span lang="el">ὁ πρεσβύτερος</span>, as he calls
      himself in the 2nd and 3rd epistles), and the belief referred to by some of
      the Fathers that he would be the Forerunner of our Lord’s second coming, as
      John the Baptist had been of His first.</p>

    <p>A new theory regarding the original Prester John has been propounded by
      Professor Bruun of Odessa, in a Russian work entitled <cite>The Migrations of
      Prester John</cite>. The author has been good enough to send me large extracts of
      this essay in (French) translation; and I will endeavour to set forth the
      main points as well as the small space that can be given to the matter will
      admit. Some remarks and notes shall be added, but I am not in a position to
      do justice to Professor Bruun’s views, from the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>want of access to some of
      his most important authorities, such as Brosset’s <cite>History of Georgia</cite>, and
      its appendices.</p>

    <p>It will be well, before going further, to give the essential parts of the
      passage in the History of Bishop Otto of Freisingen (referred to in vol i.
      p. 229), which contains the first allusion to a personage styled Prester
      John:</p>

    <p>“We saw also there [at Rome in 1145] the afore-mentioned Bishop of Gabala,
      from Syria.... We heard him bewailing with tears the peril of the Church
      beyond-sea since the capture of Edessa, and uttering his intention on that
      account to cross the Alps and seek aid from the King of the Romans and the
      King of the Franks. He was also telling us how, not many years before, one
      <span class="smcap">John</span>, <span class="smcap">King</span> and <span class="smcap">Priest</span>, who dwells in the extreme Orient beyond Persia and
      Armenia, and is (with his people) a Christian, but a Nestorian, had waged
      war against the brother Kings of the Persians and Medes who are called the
      Samiards, and had captured Ecbatana, of which we have spoken above, the
      seat of their dominion. The said Kings having met him with their forces
      made up of Persians, Medes, and Assyrians, the battle had been maintained
      for 3 days, either side preferring death to flight. But at last <span class="smcap">Presbyter
      John</span> (for so they are wont to style him), having routed the Persians, came
      forth the victor from a most sanguinary battle. After this victory (he
      went on to say) the aforesaid John was advancing to fight in aid of the
      Church at Jerusalem; but when he arrived at the Tigris, and found there
      no possible means of transport for his army, he turned northward, as he
      had heard that the river in that quarter was frozen over in winter-time.
      Halting there for some years<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> in expectation of a frost, which never
      came, owing to the mildness of the season, he lost many of his people
      through the unaccustomed climate, and was obliged to return homewards. This
      personage is said to be of the ancient race of those Magi who are mentioned
      in the Gospel, and to rule the same nations that they did, and to have such
      glory and wealth that he uses (they say) only an emerald sceptre. It was
      (they say) from his being fired by the example of his fathers, who came to
      adore Christ in the cradle, that he was proposing to go to Jerusalem, when
      he was prevented by the cause already alleged.”</p>

    <p>Professor Bruun will not accept Oppert’s explanation, which identifies
      this King and Priest with the Gur-Khan of Karacathay, for whose profession
      of Christianity there is indeed (as has been indicated—<i>supra</i>) no real
      evidence; who could not be said to have made an attack upon any pair of
      brother Kings of the Persians and the Medes, nor to have captured Ecbatana
      (a city, whatever its identity, of Media); who could never have had any
      intention of coming to Jerusalem; and whose geographical position in no way
      suggested the mention of Armenia.</p>

    <p>Professor Bruun thinks he finds a warrior much better answering to the
      indications in the Georgian prince John Orbelian, the general-in-chief
      under several successive Kings of Georgia in that age.</p>

    <p>At the time when the Gur-Khan defeated Sanjar the real brothers of the
      latter had been long dead; Sanjar had withdrawn from interference with
      the affairs of Western Persia; and Hamadán (if this is to be regarded as
      Ecbatana) was no residence of his. But it was the residence of Sanjar’s
      nephew Mas’úd, in whose hands was now the dominion of Western Persia;
      whilst Mas’úd’s nephew, Dáúd, held Media, <i>i.e.</i> Azerbeiján, Arrán, and
      Armenia. It is in these two princes that Professor Bruun sees the <em>Samiardi
      fratres</em> of the German chronicler.</p>

    <p>Again the expression “extreme Orient” is to be interpreted by local
      usage. And with the people of Little Armenia, through whom probably such
      intelligence reached the Bishop of Gabala, the expression the <em>East</em>
      signified specifically Great Armenia (which was then a part of the kingdom
      of Georgia and Abkhasia), as Dulaurier has stated.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

    <p>It is true that the Georgians were not really Nestorians, but followers of
      the Greek Church. It was the fact, however, that in general, the Armenians,
      whom the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>Greeks accused of following the Jacobite errors, retorted upon
      members of the Greek Church with the reproach of the opposite heresy of
      Nestorianism. And the attribution of Nestorianism to a Georgian Prince is,
      like the expression “<em>extreme East</em>,” an indication of the Armenian channel
      through which the story came.</p>

    <p>The intention to march to the aid of the Christians in Palestine is more
      like the act of a Georgian General than that of a Karacathayan Khan; and
      there are in the history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem several indications of
      the proposal at least of Georgian assistance.</p>

    <p>The personage in question is said to have come from the country of the
      Magi, from whom he was descended. But these have frequently been supposed
      to come from Great Armenia. <i>E.g.</i> Friar Jordanus says they came from
      Moghán.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

    <p>The name <em>Ecbatana</em> has been so variously applied that it was likely
      to lead to ambiguities. But it so happens that, in a previous passage
      of his History, Bishop Otto of Freisingen, in rehearsing some Oriental
      information gathered apparently from the same Bishop of Gabala, has shown
      what was the place that he had been taught to identify with Ecbatana,
      viz. the old Armenian city of <span class="smcap">Ani</span>.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Now this city was captured from the
      Turks, on behalf of the King of Georgia, David the Restorer, by his great
      <em>sbasalar</em>,<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> John Orbelian, in 1123–24.</p>

    <p>Professor Bruun also lays stress upon a passage in a German chronicle of
      date some years later than Otho’s work:</p>

    <p lang="la">“1141. Liupoldus dux Bawariorum obiit, Henrico fratre ejus succedente
      in ducatu. Iohannes Presbyter Rex Armeniæ et Indiæ cum duobus regibus
      fratribus Persarum et Medorum pugnavit et vicit.”<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

    <p>He asks how the Gur-Khan of Karakhitai could be styled King of <em>Armenia</em>
      and of India? It may be asked, <i lang="la">per contra</i>, how either the King of Georgia
      or his <em>Peshwa</em> (to use the Mahratta analogy of John Orbelian’s position)
      could be styled King of Armenia and of <em>India</em>? In reply to this, Professor
      Bruun adduces a variety of quotations which he considers as showing that
      the term <em>India</em> was applied to some Caucasian region.</p>

    <p>My own conviction is that the report of Otto of Freisingen is not merely
      the <em>first mention</em> of a great Asiatic potentate called Prester John, but
      that his statement is the whole and sole basis of good faith on which the
      story of such a potentate rested; and I am quite as willing to believe, on
      due evidence, that the nucleus of fact to which his statement referred,
      and on which such a pile of long-enduring fiction was erected, occurred
      in Armenia as that it occurred in Turan. Indeed in many respects the
      story would thus be more comprehensible. One cannot attach any value to
      the quotation from the Annalist in Pertz, because there seems no reason
      to doubt that the passage is a mere adaptation of the report by Bishop
      Otto, of whose work the Annalist makes other use, as is indeed admitted by
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>Professor Bruun, who (be it said) is a pattern of candour in controversy.
      But much else that the Professor alleges is interesting and striking. The
      fact that Azerbeijan and the adjoining regions were known as “the East”
      is patent to the readers of this book in many a page, where the Khan and
      his Mongols in occupation of that region are styled by Polo <em>Lord of the</em>
      <span class="smcap">Levant</span>, <em>Tartars of the</em> <span class="smcap">Levant</span> (<i>i.e.</i> of the East), even when the speaker’s
      standpoint is in far Cathay.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The mention of <em>Aní</em> as identical with
      the Ecbatana of which Otto had heard is a remarkable circumstance which I
      think even Oppert has overlooked. That this Georgian hero <em>was</em> a Christian
      and that his name <em>was</em> John are considerable facts. Oppert’s conversion
      of Korkhan into Yokhanan or John is anything but satisfactory. The
      identification proposed again makes it quite intelligible how the so-called
      Prester John should have talked about coming to the aid of the Crusaders; a
      point so difficult to explain on Oppert’s theory, that he has been obliged
      to introduce a duplicate John in the person of a Greek Emperor to solve
      that knot; another of the weaker links in his argument. In fact, Professor
      Bruun’s thesis seems to me more than fairly successful in <em>paving the way</em>
      for the introduction of a Caucasian Prester John; the barriers are removed,
      the carpets are spread, the trumpets sound royally—but the conquering hero
      comes not!</p>

    <p>He does very nearly come. The almost royal power and splendour of the
      Orbelians at this time is on record: “They held the office of <em>Sbasalar</em> or
      Generalissimo of all Georgia. All the officers of the King’s Palace were
      under their authority. Besides that they had 12 standards of their own,
      and under each standard 1000 warriors mustered. As the custom was for the
      King’s flag to be white and the pennon over it red, it was ruled that the
      Orpelian flag should be red and the pennon white.... At banquets they alone
      had the right to couches whilst other princes had cushions only. Their
      food was served on silver; and to them it belonged to crown the kings.”<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
      Orpel Ivané, <i>i.e.</i> John Orbelian, Grand <em>Sbasalar</em>, was for years the pride
      of Georgia and the hammer of the Turks. In 1123–1124 he wrested from them
      Tiflis and the whole country up to the Araxes, including <em>Ani</em>, as we
      have said. His King David, the Restorer, bestowed on him large additional
      domains from the new conquests; and the like brilliant service and career
      of conquest was continued under David’s sons and successors, Demetrius and
      George; his later achievements, however, and some of the most brilliant,
      occurring after the date of the Bishop of Gabala’s visit to Rome. But still
      we hear of no actual conflict with the chief princes of the Seljukian
      house, and of no event in his history so important as to account for his
      being made to play the part of Presbyter Johannes in the story of the
      Bishop of Gabala. Professor Bruun’s most forcible observation in reference
      to this rather serious difficulty is that the historians have transmitted
      to us extremely little detail concerning the reign of Demetrius II.,
      and do not even agree as to its duration. Carebat vate sacro: “It was,”
      says Brosset, “long and glorious, but it lacked a commemorator.” If new
      facts can be alleged, the identity may still be proved. But meantime the
      conquests of the Gur-Khan and his defeat of Sanjar, just at a time which
      suits the story, are indubitable, and this great advantage Oppert’s thesis
      retains. As regards the claim to the title of <em>Presbyter</em> nothing worth
      mentioning is alleged on either side.</p>

    <p>When the Mongol Conquests threw Asia open to Frank travellers in the middle
      of the 13th century, their minds were full of Prester John; they sought in
      vain for an adequate representative, but it was not in the nature of things
      but they should find <em>some</em> representative. In fact they found <em>several</em>.
      Apparently no real tradition existed among the Eastern Christians of any
      such personage, but the persistent demand produced a supply, and the honour
      of identification with Prester John, after hovering over one head and
      another, settled finally upon that of the King of the Keraits, whom we find
      to play the part in our text.</p>

    <p>Thus in Plano Carpini’s single mention of Prester John as the King of the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>Christians of India the Greater, who defeats the Tartars by an elaborate
      stratagem, Oppert recognizes Sultan Jaláluddín of Khwarizm and his
      temporary success over the Mongols in Afghanistan. In the Armenian Prince
      Sempad’s account, on the other hand, this Christian King of India is
      <em>aided</em> by the Tartars to defeat and harass the neighbouring Saracens, his
      enemies, and becomes the Mongol’s vassal. In the statement of Rubruquis,
      though distinct reference is made to the conquering Gurkhan (under the name
      of Coir Cham of Caracatay), the title of <em>King John</em> is assigned to the
      Naiman Prince (<em>Kushluk</em>), who had married the daughter of the last lineal
      sovereign of Karakhitai, and usurped his power, whilst, with a strange
      complication of confusion, <span class="smcap">Unc</span>, Prince of the Crit and Merkit (Kerait and
      Merkit, two great tribes of Mongolia)<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and Lord of Karákorum, is made
      the brother and successor of this Naiman Prince. His version of the story,
      as it proceeds, has so much resemblance to Polo’s, that we shall quote
      the words. The Crit and Merkit, he says, were Nestorian Christians. “But
      their Lord had abandoned the worship of Christ to follow idols, and kept
      by him those priests of the idols who are all devil-raisers and sorcerers.
      Beyond his pastures, at the distance of ten or fifteen days’ journey, were
      the pastures of the <span class="smcap">Moal</span> (Mongol), who were a very poor people, without
      a leader and without any religion except sorceries and divinations, such
      as all the people of those parts put so much faith in. Next to Moal was
      another poor tribe called <span class="smcap">Tartar</span>. King John having died without an heir,
      his brother Unc got his wealth, and caused himself to be proclaimed Cham,
      and sent out his flocks and herds even to the borders of Moal. At that time
      there was a certain blacksmith called Chinghis among the tribe of Moal,
      and he used to lift the cattle of Unc Chan as often as he had a chance,
      insomuch that the herdsmen of Unc Chan made complaint to their master. The
      latter assembled an army, and invaded the land of the Moal in search of
      Chinghis, but he fled and hid himself among the Tartars. So Unc, having
      plundered the Moal and Tartars, returned home. And Chinghis addressed the
      Tartars and Moal, saying: ‘It is because we have no leader that we are
      thus oppressed by our neighbours.’ So both Tartars and Moal made Chinghis
      himself their leader and captain. And having got a host quietly together,
      he made a sudden onslaught upon Unc and conquered him, and compelled him
      to flee into Cathay. On that occasion his daughter was taken, and given by
      Chinghis to one of his sons, to whom she bore Mangu, who now reigneth....
      The land in which they (the Mongols) first were, and where the residence of
      Chinghis still exists, is called <em>Onan Kerule</em>.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> But because Caracoran
      is in the country which was their first conquest, they regard it as a royal
      city, and there hold the elections of their Chan.”</p>

    <p>Here we see plainly that the Unc Chan of Rubruquis is the Unc Can or Unecan
      of Polo. In the narrative of the former, Unc is only <em>connected</em> with King
      or Prester John; in that of the latter, rehearsing the story as heard some
      20 or 25 years later, the two are <em>identified</em>. The shadowy <em>rôle</em> of
      Prester John has passed from the Ruler of Kara Khitai to the Chief of the
      Keraits. This transfer brings us to another history.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>

    <p>We have already spoken of the extensive diffusion of Nestorian Christianity
      in Asia during the early and Middle Ages. The Christian historian Gregory
      Abulfaraj relates a curious history of the conversion, in the beginning
      of the 11th century, of the King of <em>Kerith</em> with his people, dwelling
      in the remote north-east of the land of the Turks. And that the Keraits
      continued to profess Christianity down to the time of Chinghiz is attested
      by Rashiduddin’s direct statement, as well as by the numerous Christian
      princesses from that tribe of whom we hear in Mongol history. It is the
      chief of this tribe of whom Rubruquis and Polo speak under the name of Unc
      Khan, and whom the latter identifies with Prester John. His proper name is
      called Tuli by the Chinese, and Togrul by the Persian historians, but the
      Kin sovereign of Northern China had conferred on him the title of <em>Wang</em>
      or King, from which his people gave him the slightly corrupted cognomen of
      <span lang="ar">اونک خان</span>, which some scholars read <em>Awang</em>, and <em>Avenk</em> Khan, but which
      the spelling of Rubruquis and Polo shows probably to have been pronounced
      as <em>Aung</em> or <em>Ung</em> Khan.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The circumstance stated by Rubruquis of his
      having abandoned the profession of Christianity, is not alluded to by
      Eastern writers; but in any case his career is not a credit to the Faith.
      I cannot find any satisfactory corroboration of the claims of supremacy
      over the Mongols which Polo ascribes to Aung Khan. But that his power
      and dignity were considerable, appears from the term <em>Pádsháh</em> which
      Rashiduddin applies to him. He had at first obtained the sovereignty of the
      Keraits by the murder of two of his brothers and several nephews. Yesugai,
      the father of Chinghiz, had been his staunch friend, and had aided him
      effectually to recover his dominion from which he had been expelled. After
      a reign of many years he was again ejected, and in the greatest necessity
      sought the help of Temujin (afterwards called Chinghiz Khan), by whom he
      was treated with the greatest consideration. This was in 1196. For some
      years the two chiefs conducted their forays in alliance, but differences
      sprang up between them; the son of Aung Khan entered into a plot to kill
      Temujin, and in 1202–1203 they were in open war. The result will be related
      in connection with the next chapters.</p>

    <p>We may observe that the idea which Joinville picked up in the East about
      Prester John corresponds pretty closely with that set forth by Marco.
      Joinville represents him as one of the princes to whom the Tartars were
      tributary in the days of their oppression, and as “their ancient enemy”;
      one of their first acts, on being organized under a king of their own, was
      to attack him and conquer him, slaying all that bore arms, but sparing all
      monks and priests. The expression used by Joinville in speaking of the
      original land of the Tartars, “<em>une grande</em> berrie <em>de sablon</em>,” has not
      been elucidated in any edition that I have seen. It is the Arabic <span lang="ar">بريه</span>
      <em>Băríya</em>, “a Desert.” No doubt Joinville learned the word in Palestine.

      [Dr. Bretschneider (<cite>Med. Res.</cite>) has a chapter on Kara-Khitaí
      (I. 208 <i>seqq.</i>) and in a long note on Bala Sagun, which he calls
      Belasagun, he says (p. 226) that “according to the Tarikh Djihan
      Kúshai (<cite>d’Ohsson</cite>, i. 433), the city of Belasagun had been founded
      by Buku Khan, sovereign of the Uigurs, in a well-watered plain of
      Turkestan with rich pastures. The Arabian geographers first mention
      Belasagun, in the ninth or tenth century, as a city beyond the Sihun
      or Yaxartes, depending on <em>Isfidjab</em> (Sairam, according to Lerch),
      and situated east of Taras. They state that the people of Turkestan
      considered Belasagun to represent ‘the navel of the earth,’ on
      account of its being situated in the middle between east and west,
      and likewise between north and south.” (<cite>Sprenger’s Poststr. d.
      Or., Mavarannahar</cite>). Dr. Bretschneider adds (p. 227): “It is not
      improbable that ancient Belasagun was situated at the same place
      where, according to the T’ang history, the Khan of one branch of the
      Western T’u Kuë (Turks) had his residence in the seventh century.
      It is stated in the T’ang shu that <em>Ibi Shabolo Shehu Khan</em>, who
      reigned in the first half of the seventh century, placed his ordo on
      the northern border of the river <em>Sui ye</em>. This river, and a city
      of the same name, are frequently mentioned in the T’ang annals of
      the seventh and eighth centuries, in connection with the warlike
      expeditions of the Chinese in Central Asia. <em>Sui ye</em> was situated on
      the way from the river <em>Ili</em> to the city of Ta-lo-sz’ (Talas). In
      679 the Chinese had built on the Sui ye River a fortress; but in 748

      <a id="Footnote_435" href="#FNanchor_435" class="label">[5]</a> Here is the passage, which is worth giving for more reasons
      than one:

      <p>“That portion of ancient Babylon which is still occupied is (as
        we have heard from persons of character from beyond sea) styled
        <span class="smcap">Baldach</span>, whilst the part that lies, according to the prophecy,
        deserted and pathless extends some ten miles to the Tower of Babel.
        The inhabited portion called Baldach is very large and populous;
        and though it should belong to the Persian monarchy it has been
        conceded by the Kings of the Persians to their High Priest, whom
        they call the <em>Caliph</em>; in order that in this also a certain analogy
        [<i lang="la">quaedam habitudo</i>] such as has been often remarked before, should
        be exhibited between Babylon and Rome. For the same (privilege) that
        here in the city of Rome has been made over to our chief Pontiff by
        the Christian Emperor, has there been conceded to their High Priest
        by the Pagan Kings of Persia, to whom Babylonia has for a long time
        been subject. But the Kings of the Persians (just as our Kings have
        their royal city, like Aachen) have themselves established the seat
        of their kingdom at Egbatana, which, in the Book of Judith, Arphaxat
        is said to have founded, and which in their tongue is called
        <span class="smcap">Hani</span>, containing as they allege 100,000 or more fighting men, and
        have reserved to themselves nothing of Babylon except the nominal
        dominion. Finally, the place which is now vulgarly called Babylonia,
        as I have mentioned, is not upon the Euphrates (at all) as people
        suppose, but on the Nile, about 6 days’ journey from Alexandria,
        and is the same as Memphis, to which Cambyses, the son of Cyrus,
        anciently gave the name of Babylon.”—Ottonis Frising. Lib. VII. cap.

  <div class="subh4">Of Chinghis, and how he became the First Kaan of the Tartars.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> it came to pass in the year of Christ’s Incarnation 1187 that the
    Tartars made them a King whose name was <span class="smcap">Chinghis Kaan</span>.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLVII11" href="#Note_XLVII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> He was a man
    of great worth, and of great ability (eloquence), and valour. And as soon
    as the news that he had been chosen King was spread abroad through those
    countries, all the Tartars in the world came to him and owned him for their
    Lord. And right well did he maintain the Sovereignty they had given him.
    What shall I say? The Tartars gathered to him in astonishing multitude, and
    when he saw such numbers he made a great furniture of spears and arrows
    and such other arms as they used, and set about the conquest of all those
    regions till he had conquered eight provinces. When he conquered a province
    he did no harm to the people or their property, but merely established some
    of his own men in the country along with a proportion of theirs, whilst he
    led the remainder to the conquest of other provinces. And when those whom
    he had conquered became aware how well and safely he protected them against
    all others, and how they suffered no ill at his hands, and saw what a noble
    prince he was, then they joined him heart and soul and became his devoted
    followers. And when he had thus gathered such a multitude that they seemed
    to cover the earth, he began to think of conquering a great part of the
    world. Now in the year of Christ 1200 he sent an embassy to Prester John,
    and desired to have <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>his daughter to wife. But when Prester John heard that
    Chinghis Kaan demanded his daughter in marriage he waxed very wroth, and
    said to the Envoys, “What impudence is this, to ask my daughter to wife!
    Wist he not well that he was my liegeman and serf? Get ye back to him and
    tell him that I had liever set my daughter in the fire than give her in
    marriage to him, and that he deserves death at my hand, rebel and traitor
    that he is!” So he bade the Envoys begone at once, and never come into his
    presence again. The Envoys, on receiving this reply, departed straightway,
    and made haste to their master, and related all that Prester John had
    ordered them to say, keeping nothing back.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLVII12" href="#Note_XLVII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XLVII11" href="#NoteAnchor_XLVII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Temujin was born in the year 1155, according to all the Persian
      historians, who are probably to be relied on; the Chinese put the event
      in 1162. 1187 does not appear to be a date of special importance in his
      history. His inauguration as sovereign under the name of Chinghiz Kaan was
      in 1202 according to the Persian authorities, in 1206 according to the
      Chinese.</p>

    <p>In a preceding note (<a href="#Page_236">p. 236</a>) we have quoted a passage in which Rubruquis
      calls Chinghiz “a certain blacksmith.” This mistaken notion seems to have
      originated in the resemblance of his name <em>Temújin</em> to the Turki <em>Temúrjí</em>,
      a blacksmith; but it was common throughout Asia in the Middle Ages, and the
      story is to be found not only in Rubruquis, but in the books of Hayton, the
      Armenian prince, and of Ibn Batuta, the Moor. That cranky Orientalist, Dr.
      Isaac Jacob Schmidt, positively reviles William Rubruquis, one of the most
      truthful and delightful of travellers, and certainly not inferior to his
      critic in mother-wit, for adopting this story, and rebukes Timkowski—not
      for adopting it, but for merely telling us the very interesting fact that
      the story was still, in 1820, current in Mongolia. (<cite>Schmidt’s San. Setz.</cite>
      376, and <cite>Timkowski</cite>, I. 147.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XLVII12" href="#NoteAnchor_XLVII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—Several historians, among others Abulfaraj, represent Chinghiz as
      having married a daughter of Aung Khan; and this is current among some
      of the mediæval European writers, such as Vincent of Beauvais. It is
      also adopted by Pétis de la Croix in his history of Chinghiz, apparently
      from a comparatively late Turkish historian; and both D’Herbelot and St.
      Martin state the same; but there seems to be no foundation for it in the
      best authorities: either Persian or Chinese. (See <cite>Abulfaragius</cite>, p. 285;
      <cite>Speculum Historiale</cite>, Bk. XXIX. ch. lxix.; <cite>Hist. of Genghiz Can</cite>, p. 29;
      and <cite>Golden Horde</cite>, pp. 61–62.) But there is a real story at the basis of
      Polo’s, which seems to be this: About 1202, when Aung Khan and Chinghiz
      were still acting in professed alliance, a double union was proposed
      between Aung Khan’s daughter Jaur Bigi and Chinghiz’s son Juji, and between
      Chinghiz’s daughter Kijin Bigi and Togrul’s grandson Kush Buka. From
      certain circumstances this union fell through, and this was one of the
      circumstances which opened the breach between the two chiefs. There were,
      however, several marriages between the families. (<cite>Erdmann</cite>, 283; others
      are quoted under <a href="#Note_LIX12">ch. lix., note 2</a>.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">How Chinghis mustered his People to march against Prester John.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Chinghis Kaan heard the brutal message that Prester John had sent him,
    such rage seized him that his heart came nigh to bursting within him, for
    he was a man of a very lofty spirit. At last he spoke, and that so loud
    that all who were present could hear him: “Never more might he be prince
    if he took not revenge for the brutal message of Prester John, and such
    revenge that insult never in this world was so dearly paid for. And before
    long Prester John should know whether he were his serf or no!”</p>

  <p>So then he mustered all his forces, and levied such a host as never before
    was seen or heard of, sending word to Prester John to be on his defence.
    And when Prester John had sure tidings that Chinghis was really coming
    against him with such a multitude, he still professed to treat it as a
    jest and a trifle, for, quoth he, “these be no soldiers.” Natheless he
    marshalled his forces and mustered his people, and made great preparations,
    in order that if Chinghis did come, he might take him and put him to death.
    In fact he marshalled such an host of many different nations that it was a
    world’s wonder.</p>

  <p>And so both sides gat them ready to battle. And why should I make a
    long story of it? Chinghis Kaan with all his host arrived at a vast and
    beautiful plain which was called <span class="smcap">Tanduc</span>, belonging to Prester John, and
    there he pitched his camp; and so great was the multitude of his people
    that it was impossible to number them. And when he got tidings that Prester
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>John was coming, he rejoiced greatly, for the place afforded a fine and
    ample battle-ground, so he was right glad to tarry for him there, and
    greatly longed for his arrival.</p>

  <p>But now leave we Chinghis and his host, and let us return to Prester John
    and his people.</p>

  <hr class="d40" />
  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XLIX1"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER XLIX</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">How Prester John marched to meet Chinghis.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> the story goes that when Prester John became aware that Chinghis with
    his host was marching against him, he went forth to meet him with all his
    forces, and advanced until he reached the same plain of Tanduc, and pitched
    his camp over against that of Chinghis Kaan at a distance of 20 miles. And
    then both armies remained at rest for two days that they might be fresher
    and heartier for battle.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLIX11" href="#Note_XLIX11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>So when the two great hosts were pitched on the plains of Tanduc as you
    have heard, Chinghis Kaan one day summoned before him his astrologers, both
    Christians and Saracens, and desired them to let him know which of the
    two hosts would gain the battle, his own or Prester John’s. The Saracens
    tried to ascertain, but were unable to give a true answer; the Christians,
    however, did give a true answer, and showed manifestly beforehand how the
    event should be. For they got a cane and split it lengthwise, and laid
    one half on this side and one half on that, allowing no one to touch the
    pieces. And one piece of cane they called <em>Chinghis Kaan</em>, and the other
    piece they called <em>Prester John</em>. And then they said to Chinghis: “Now
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>mark! and you will see the event of the battle, and who shall have the
    best of it; for whose cane soever shall get above the other, to him shall
    victory be.” He replied that he would fain see it, and bade them begin.
    Then the Christian astrologers read a Psalm out of the Psalter, and went
    through other incantations. And lo! whilst all were beholding, the cane
    that bore the name of Chinghis Kaan, without being touched by anybody,
    advanced to the other that bore the name of Prester John, and got on the
    top of it. When the Prince saw that he was greatly delighted, and seeing
    how in this matter he found the Christians to tell the truth, he always
    treated them with great respect, and held them for men of truth for ever
    after.<a id="NoteAnchor_XLIX12" href="#Note_XLIX12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XLIX11" href="#NoteAnchor_XLIX11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Polo in the preceding chapter has stated that this plain of Tanduc
      was in Prester John’s country. He plainly regards it as identical with
      the Tanduc of which he speaks more particularly in <a href="#CHAPTER_LIX1">ch. lix.</a> as belonging
      to Prester John’s descendants, and which must be located near the Chinese
      Wall. He is no doubt wrong in placing the battle there. Sanang Setzen puts
      the battle between the two, the only one which he mentions, “at the outflow
      of the Onon near Kulen Buira.” The same action is placed by De Mailla’s
      authorities at Calantschan, by P. Hyacinth at Kharakchin Schatu, by Erdmann
      after Rashid in the vicinity of Hulun Barkat and Kalanchinalt, which latter
      was on the borders of the Churché or Manchus. All this points to the
      vicinity of Buir Nor and Hulan or Kalon Nor (though the Onon is far from
      these). But this was <em>not</em> the final defeat of Aung Khan or Prester John,
      which took place some time later (in 1203) at a place called the Chacher
      Ondur (or Heights), which Gaubil places between the Tula and the Kerulun,
      therefore near the modern Urga. Aung Khan was wounded, and fled over the
      frontier of the Naiman; the officers of that tribe seized and killed him.
      (<cite>Schmidt</cite>, 87, 383; <cite>Erdmann</cite>, 297; <cite>Gaubil</cite>, p. 10.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XLIX12" href="#NoteAnchor_XLIX12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—A Tartar divination by twigs, but different from that here
      employed, is older than Herodotus, who ascribes it to the Scythians. We
      hear of one something like the last among the Alans, and (from Tacitus)
      among the Germans. The words of Hosea (iv. 12), “My people ask counsel at
      their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them,” are thus explained by
      Theophylactus: “They stuck up a couple of sticks, whilst murmuring certain
      charms and incantations; the sticks then, by the operation of devils,
      direct or indirect, would fall over, and the direction of their fall was
      noted,” etc. The Chinese method of divination comes still nearer to that
      in the text. It is conducted by tossing in the air two symmetrical pieces
      of wood or bamboo of a peculiar form. It is described by Mendoza, and more
      particularly, with illustrations, by Doolittle.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>But Rubruquis would seem to have witnessed nearly the same process that
      Polo describes. He reprehends the conjuring practices of the Nestorian
      priests among the Mongols, who seem to have tried to rival the indigenous
      <em>Káms</em> or Medicine-men. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>Visiting the Lady Kuktai, a Christian Queen of
      Mangu Kaan, who was ill, he says: “The Nestorians were repeating certain
      verses, I know not what (they said it was part of a Psalm), over two twigs
      which were brought into contact in the hands of two men. The monk stood by
      during the operation” (p. 326).<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Pétis de la Croix quotes from Thévenot’s
      travels, a similar mode of divination as much used, before a fight, among
      the Barbary corsairs. Two men sit on the deck facing one another and each
      holding two arrows by the points, and hitching the notches of each pair of
      arrows into the other pair. Then the ship’s writer reads a certain Arabic
      formula, and it is pretended that whilst this goes on, the two sets of
      arrows, <em>of which one represents the Turks and the other the Christians</em>,
      struggle together in spite of the resistance of the holders, and finally
      one rises over the other. This is perhaps the divination by arrows which is
      prohibited in the Koran. (<cite>Sura</cite>, V. v. 92.) It is related by Abulfeda that
      Mahomed found in the Kaaba an image of Abraham with such arrows in his hand.</p>

    <p>P. della Valle describes the same process, conducted by a Mahomedan
      conjuror of Aleppo: “By his incantations he made the four points of the
      arrows come together without any movement of the holders, and by the
      way the points spontaneously placed themselves, obtained answers to
      interrogatories.”</p>

    <p>And Mr. Jaeschke writes from Lahaul: “There are many different ways of
      divination practised among the Buddhists; and that also mentioned by Marco
      Polo is known to our Lama, but in a slightly different way, making use of
      <em>two arrows</em> instead of a cane split up, wherefore this kind is called
      <em>da-mo</em>, ‘Arrow-divination.’” Indeed the practice is not extinct in India,
      for in 1833 Mr. Vigne witnessed its application to detect the robber of a
      government chest at Lodiana.</p>

    <p>As regards Chinghiz’s respect for the Christians there are other stories.
      Abulfaragius has one about Chinghiz seeing in a dream a religious person
      who promised him success. He told the dream to his wife, Aung Khan’s
      daughter, who said the description answered to that of the bishop who
      used to visit her father. Chinghiz then inquired for a bishop among the
      Uighúr Christians in his camp, and they indicated Mar Denha. Chinghiz
      thenceforward was milder towards the Christians, and showed them many
      distinctions (<a href="#Page_285">p. 285</a>). Vincent of Beauvais also speaks of Rabbanta, a
      Nestorian monk, who lived in the confidence of Chinghiz’s wife, daughter
      of “the Christian King David or Prester John,” and who used by divination
      to make many revelations to the Tartars. We have already said that there
      seems no ground for assigning a daughter of Aung Khan as wife to Chinghiz.
      But there was a <em>niece</em> of the former, named Abika, among the wives of
      Chinghiz. And Rashiduddin <em>does</em> relate a dream of the Kaan’s in relation
      to her. But it was to the effect that he was divinely commanded to give her
      away; and this he did next morning!</p>

      be confounded with rabdomancy, in which bundles of wands or arrows
      were used.” Ammianus Marcellinus (XXXI. 2. 350) says this mode of

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> after both sides had rested well those two days, they armed for the
    fight and engaged in desperate combat; and it was the greatest battle
    that ever was seen. The numbers that were slain on both sides were very

    Prester John was slain. And from that time forward, day by day, his kingdom

  </div>

  <p>I may tell you that Chinghis Kaan reigned six years after this battle,
    engaged continually in conquest, and taking many a province and city and
    stronghold. But at the end of those six years he went against a certain
    castle that was called <span class="smcap">Caaju</span>, and there he was shot with an arrow in the
    knee, so that he died of his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>wound. A great pity it was, for he was a
    valiant man and a wise.<a id="NoteAnchor_L11" href="#Note_L11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>I will now tell you who reigned after Chinghis, and then about the manners
    and customs of the Tartars.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_L11" href="#NoteAnchor_L11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Chinghiz in fact survived Aung Khan some 24 years, dying during his
      fifth expedition against Tangut, 18th August 1227, aged 65 according to
      the Chinese accounts, 72 according to the Persian. Sanang Setzen says that
      Kurbeljin Goa Khatún, the beautiful Queen of Tangut, who had passed into
      the tents of the conqueror, did him some bodily mischief (it is not said
      what), and then went and drowned herself in the Karamuren (or Hwang-ho),
      which thenceforth was called by the Mongols the <em>Khátún-gol</em>, or Lady’s
      River, a name which it in fact still bears. Carpini relates that Chinghiz
      was killed by lightning. The Persian and Chinese historians, however, agree
      in speaking of his death as natural. Gaubil calls the place of his death
      Lou-pan, which he says was in lat. 38°. Rashiduddin calls it Leung-Shan,
      which appears to be the mountain range still so called in the heart of Shensi.</p>

    <p>The name of the place before which Polo represents him as mortally wounded
      is very variously given. According to Gaubil, Chinghiz was in reality
      dangerously wounded by an arrow-shot at the siege of Taitongfu in 1212. And
      it is possible, as Oppert suggests, that Polo’s account of his death before
      <em>Caagiu</em> (as I prefer the reading), arose out of a confusion between this
      circumstance and those of the death of <em>Mangku Kaan</em>, which is said to have
      occurred at the assault of <span class="smcap">Hochau</span> in Sze-ch’uan, a name which Polo would
      write <em>Caagiu</em>, or nearly so. Abulfaragius specifically says that Mangku
      Kaan died <em>by an arrow</em>; though it is true that other authors say he died
      of disease, and Haiton that he was drowned; all which shows how excusable
      were Polo’s errors as to events occurring 50 to 100 years before his time.
      (See <cite>Oppert’s Presbyter Johannes</cite>, p. 76; <cite>De Mailla</cite>, IX. 275, and note;
      <cite>Gaubil</cite>, 18, 50, 52, 121; <cite>Erdmann</cite>, 443; <cite>San. Setzen</cite>, 103.)</p>

    <p>It is only by referring back to ch. xlvii., where we are told that Chinghiz
      “began to think of conquering a great part of the world,” that we see Polo
      to have been really aware of the vast extent and aim of the conquests
      of Chinghiz; the <em>aim</em> being literally the conquest of the world as he
      conceived it; the <em>extent</em> of the empire which he initiated actually
      covering (probably) one half of the whole number of the human race. (See
      remarks in <cite>Koeppen, Die Relig. des Buddha</cite>, II. 86.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of those who did Reign after Chinghis Kaan, and of the Customs of the Tartars.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> the next that reigned after Chinghis Kaan, their first Lord,<a id="NoteAnchor_LI11" href="#Note_LI11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a>
    was <span class="smcap">Cuy Kaan</span>, and the third Prince was <span class="smcap">Batuy Kaan</span>, and the fourth was
    <span class="smcap">Alacou Kaan</span>, the fifth <span class="smcap">Mongou Kaan</span>, the sixth <span class="smcap">Cublay Kaan</span>, who is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>the
    sovereign now reigning, and is more potent than any of the five who went
    before him; in fact, if you were to take all those five together, they
    would not be so powerful as he is.<a id="NoteAnchor_LI12" href="#Note_LI12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> Nay, I will say yet more; for
    if you were to put together all the Christians in the world, with their
    Emperors and their Kings, the whole of these Christians,—aye, and throw in
    the Saracens to boot,—would not have such power, or be able to do so much
    as this Cublay, who is the Lord of all the Tartars in the world, those of
    the Levant and of the Ponent included; for these are all his liegemen and
    subjects. I mean to show you all about this great power of his in this book
    of ours.</p>

  <p>You should be told also that all the Grand Kaans, and all the descendants
    of Chinghis their first Lord, are carried to a mountain that is called
    <span class="smcap">Altay</span> to be interred. Wheresoever the Sovereign may die, he is carried to
    his burial in that mountain with his predecessors; no matter an the place
    of his death were 100 days’ journey distant, thither must he be carried to
    his burial.<a id="NoteAnchor_LI13" href="#Note_LI13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>Let me tell you a strange thing too. When they are carrying the body of any
    Emperor to be buried with the others, the convoy that goes with the body
    doth put to the sword all whom they fall in with on the road, saying: “Go
    and wait upon your Lord in the other world!” For they do in sooth believe
    that all such as they slay in this manner do go to serve their Lord in the
    other world. They do the same too with horses; for when the Emperor dies,
    they kill all his best horses, in order that he may have the use of them in
    the other world, as they believe. And I tell you as a certain truth, that
    when Mongou Kaan died, more than 20,000 persons, who chanced to meet the
    body on its way, were slain in the manner I have told.<a id="NoteAnchor_LI14" href="#Note_LI14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_LI11" href="#NoteAnchor_LI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Before parting with Chinghiz let me point out what has not to my
      knowledge been suggested before, that the name of “<em>Cambuscan</em> bold” in
      Chaucer’s tale is only a corruption of the name of Chinghiz. The name
      of the conqueror appears in Fr. Ricold as <em>Camiuscan</em>, from which the
      transition to Cambuscan presents no difficulty. <em>Camius</em> was, I suppose,
      a clerical corruption out of <em>Canjus</em> or <em>Cianjus</em>. In the chronicle of
      St. Antonino, however, we have him called “<em>Chinghiscan rectius</em> Tamgius
      <cite>Cam</cite>” (XIX. c. 8). If this is not merely the usual blunder of <em>t</em> for <em>c</em>,
      it presents a curious analogy to the form <em>Tankiz Khán</em> always used by Ibn
      Batuta. I do not know the origin of the latter, unless it was suggested by
      <em>tankis</em> (Ar.) “Turning upside down.” (See <cite>Pereg. Quat.</cite>, p. 119; <cite>I. B.</cite>
      III. 22, etc.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LI12" href="#NoteAnchor_LI12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—Polo’s history here is inadmissible. He introduces into the list
      of the supreme Kaans <em>Batu</em>, who was only Khan of Kipchak (the Golden
      Horde), and <em>Hulaku</em> who was Khan of Persia, whilst he omits <em>Okkodai</em>,
      the immediate successor of Chinghiz. It is also remarkable that he uses
      the form <em>Alacou</em> here instead of <em>Alaü</em> as elsewhere; nor does he seem to
      mean the same person, for he was quite well aware that <em>Alaü</em> was Lord of
      the Levant, who sent ambassadors to the Great Khan Cúbláy, and could not
      therefore be one of his predecessors. The real succession ran: 1. Chinghiz;
      2. Okkodai; 3. Kuyuk; 4. Mangku; 5. Kúblái.</p>

    <p>There are quite as great errors in the history of Haiton, who had probably
      greater advantages in this respect than Marco. And I may note that in
      Teixeira’s abridgment of Mirkhond, Hulaku is made to succeed Mangku Kaan on
      the throne of Chinghiz. (<cite>Relaciones</cite>, p. 338.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LI13" href="#NoteAnchor_LI13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The <span class="smcap">Altai</span> here certainly does not mean the Great South Siberian
      Range to which the name is now applied. Both <em>Altai</em> and <em>Altun-Khan</em>
      appear sometimes to be applied by Sanang Setzen to the Khingan of the
      Chinese, or range running immediately north of the Great Wall near Kalgan.
      (See <a href="#Note_LXI11">ch. lxi. note 1</a>.) But in reference to this matter of the burial of
      Chinghiz, he describes the place as “the district of Yekeh Utek, between
      the shady side of the Altai-Khan and the sunny side of the Kentei-Khan.”
      Now the Kentei-Khan (<em>khan</em> here meaning “mountain”) is near the sources
      of the Onon, immediately to the north-east of Urga; and Altai-Khan in this
      connection cannot mean the hills near the Great Wall, 500 miles distant.</p>

    <p>According to Rashiduddin, Chinghiz was buried at a place called <em>Búrkán
      Káldún</em> (“God’s Hill”), or <em>Yekeh Kúrúk</em> (“The Great Sacred or Tabooed
      Place”); in another passage he calls the spot <em>Búdah Undúr</em> (which means, I
      fancy, the same as Búrkán Káldún), near the River Selenga. Búrkán Káldún is
      often mentioned by Sanang Setzen, and Quatremère seems to demonstrate the
      identity of this place with the mountain called by Pallas (and Timkowski)
      <em>Khanoolla</em>. This is a lofty mountain near Urga, covered with dense forest,
      and is indeed the first woody mountain reached in travelling from Peking.
      It is still held sacred by the Mongols and guarded from access, though the
      tradition of Chinghiz’s grave seems to be extinct. Now, as this Khanoolla
      (“Mount Royal,” for <em>khan</em> here means “sovereign,” and <em>oolla</em> “mountain”)
      stands immediately to the south of the <em>Kentei</em> mentioned in the quotation
      from S. Setzen, this identification agrees with his statement, on the
      supposition that the Khanoolla is the Altai of the same quotation. The
      Khanoolla must also be the <em>Han</em> mountain which Mongol chiefs claiming
      descent from Chinghiz named to Gaubil as the burial-place of that
      conqueror. Note that the Khanoolla, which we suppose to be the Altai of
      Polo, and here of Sanang Setzen, belongs to a range known as <em>Khingan</em>,
      whilst we see that Setzen elsewhere applies Altai and Altan-Khan to the
      other Khingan near the Great Wall.</p>

    <p>Erdmann relates, apparently after Rashiduddin, that Chinghiz was buried
      at the foot of a tree which had taken his fancy on a hunting expedition,
      and which he had then pointed out as the place where he desired to be
      interred. It was then conspicuous, but afterwards the adjoining trees shot
      up so rapidly, that a dense wood <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>covered the whole locality, and it became
      impossible to identify the spot. (<cite>Q. R.</cite> 117 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Timk.</cite> I. 115 <i>seqq.</i>,
      II. 475–476; <cite>San. Setz.</cite> 103, 114–115, 108–109; <cite>Gaubil</cite>, 54; <cite>Erd.</cite> 444.)</p>

    <p>[“There are no accurate indications,” says Palladius (<i>l.c.</i> pp. 11–13), “in
      the documents of the Mongol period on the burial-places of Chingiz Khan and
      of the Khans who succeeded him. The <em>Yuan-shi</em> or ‘History of the Mongol
      Dynasty in China,’ in speaking of the burial of the Khans, mentions only
      that they used to be conveyed from Peking to the north, to their common
      burial-ground in the <em>K’i-lien</em> Valley. This name cannot have anything
      in common with the ancient <em>K’i-lien</em> of the Hiung-nu, a hill situated
      to the west of the Mongol desert; the <em>K’i-lien</em> of the Mongols is to be
      sought more to the east. When Khubilai marched out against Prince Nayan,
      and reached the modern Talnor, news was received of the occupation of the
      Khan’s burial-ground by the rebels. They held out there very long, which
      exceedingly afflicted Khubilai [<em>Yüan shi lui pien</em>]; and this goes to
      prove that the tombs could not be situated much to the west. Some more
      positive information on this subject is found in the diary of the campaign
      in Mongolia in 1410, of the Ming Emperor Yung-lo [<em>Pe ching lu</em>]. He
      reached the Kerulen at the place where this river, after running south,
      takes an easterly direction. The author of the diary notes, that from
      a place one march and a half before reaching the Kerulen, a very large
      mountain was visible to the north-east, and at its foot a solitary high and
      pointed hillock, covered with stones. The author says, that the sovereigns
      of the house of Yuan used to be buried near this hill. It may therefore
      be plausibly supposed that the tombs of the Mongol Khans were near the
      Kerulen, and that the ‘K’i-lien’ of the <em>Yüan shi</em> is to be applied to this
      locality; it seems to me even, that K’i-lien is an abbreviation, customary
      to Chinese authors, of Kerulen. The way of burying the Mongol Khans is
      described in the <em>Yüan shi</em> (ch. ‘On the national religious rites of the
      Mongols’), as well as in the <em>Ch’ue keng lu</em>, ‘Memoirs of the time of the
      Yuan Dynasty.’ When burying, the greatest care was taken to conceal from
      outside people the knowledge of the locality of the tomb. With this object
      in view, after the tomb was closed, a drove of horses was driven over it,
      and by this means the ground was, for a considerable distance, trampled
      down and levelled. It is added to this (probably from hearsay) in the
      <em>Ts’ao mu tze Memoirs</em> (also of the time of the Yuan Dynasty), that a young
      camel used to be killed (in the presence of its mother) on the tomb of the
      deceased Khan; afterwards, when the time of the usual offerings of the tomb
      approached, the mother of this immolated camel was set at liberty, and she
      came crying to the place where it was killed; the locality of the tomb was
      ascertained in this way.”</p>

    <p>The Archimandrite Palladius adds in a footnote: “Our well-known Mongolist
      N. Golovkin has told us, that according to a story actually current among
      the Mongols, the tombs of the former Mongol Khans are situated near Tasola
      Hill, equally in the vicinity of the Kerulen. He states also that even
      now the Mongols are accustomed to assemble on that hill on the seventh
      day of the seventh moon (according to an ancient custom), in order to
      adore Chingiz Khan’s tomb. Altan tobchi (translated into Russian by Galsan
      Gomboeff), in relating the history of the Mongols after their expulsion
      from China, and speaking of the Khans’ tombs, calls them <em>Naiman tzagan
      gher</em>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘Eight White Tents’ (according to the number of chambers for
      the souls of the chief deceased Khans in Peking), and sometimes simply
      <em>Tzagan gher</em>, ‘the White Tent,’ which, according to the translator’s
      explanation, denotes only Chingiz Khan’s tomb.”</p>

    <p>“According to the Chinese Annals (<cite>T’ung kien kang mu</cite>), quoted by Dr.
      E. Bretschneider (<cite>Med. Res.</cite> I. p. 157), Chinghiz died near the <em>Liu
      p’an shan</em> in 1227, after having subdued the Tangut empire. On modern
      Chinese maps <em>Liu p’an shan</em> is marked south of the city of <em>Ku yüan
      chou</em>, department of <em>P’ing liang</em>, in <em>Kan suh</em>. The <em>Yüan shi</em> however,
      implies that he died in Northern Mongolia. We read there, in the annals,
      <i>s.a.</i> 1227, that in the fifth intercalary month the Emperor moved to the
      mountain <em>Liu p’an shan</em> in order to avoid the heat of the summer. In the
      sixth <span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>month the empire of the <em>Hia</em> (Tangut) submitted. Chinghiz rested on
      the river <em>Si Kiang</em> in the district of <em>Ts’ing shui</em> (in Kansuh; it has
      still the same name). In autumn, in the seventh month (August), on the day
      <em>jen wu</em>, the Emperor fell ill, and eight days later died in his palace
      <em>Ha-lao-t’u</em> on the River <em>Sa-li</em>. This river Sali is repeatedly mentioned
      in the <cite>Yüan shi</cite>, viz. in the first chapter, in connection with the first
      military doings of Chinghiz. Rashid reports (<cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, I. 58) that
      Chinghiz in 1199 retired to his residence <em>Sari Kihar</em>. The <cite>Yüan chao pi
      shi</cite> (Palladius’ transl., 81) writes the same name <em>Saari Keher</em> (<em>Keher</em>
      in modern Mongol means ‘a plain’). On the ancient map of Mongolia found
      in the <cite>Yüan shi lei pien</cite>, <em>Sa-li K’ie-rh</em> is marked south of the river
      <em>Wa-nan</em> (the <em>Onon</em> of our maps), and close to <em>Sa-li K’ie-rh</em> we read:
      ‘Here was the original abode of the Yüan’ (Mongols). Thus it seems the
      passage in the Yüan history translated above intimates that Chinghiz died
      in Mongolia, and not near the <em>Liu p’an shan</em>, as is generally believed.
      The <cite>Yüan ch’ao pi shi</cite> (Palladius’ transl., 152) and the <cite>’Ts’in cheng lu</cite>
      (Palladius’ transl., 195) both agree in stating that, after subduing the
      Tangut empire, Chinghiz returned home, and then died. Colonel Yule, in his
      <cite>Marco Polo</cite> (I. 245), states ‘that Rashid calls the place of Chinghiz’
      death <em>Leung shan</em>, which appears to be the mountain range still so-called
      in the heart of Shensi.’ I am not aware from what translation of Rashid,
      Yule’s statement is derived, but d’Ohsson (I. 375, note) seems to quote the
      same passage in translating from Rashid: ‘<em>Liu-p’an-shan</em> was situated on
      the frontiers of the <em>Churche</em> (empire of the <em>Kin</em>), <em>Nangias</em> (empire of
      the <em>Sung</em>) and <em>Tangut</em>;’ which statement is quite correct.”</p>

    <p>We now come to the Mongol tradition, which places the tomb of Chinghiz in
      the country of the Ordos, in the great bend of the Yellow River.</p>

    <p>Two Belgian missionaries, MM. de Vos and Verlinden, who visited the tomb of
      Chinghiz Khan, say that before the Mahomedan invasion, on a hill a few feet
      high, there were two courtyards, one in front of the other, surrounded by
      palisades. In the second courtyard, there were a building like a Chinese
      dwelling-house and six tents. In a double tent are kept the remains of
      the <em>bokta</em> (the Holy). The neighbouring tents contained various precious
      objects, such as a gold saddle, dishes, drinking-cups, a tripod, a kettle,
      and many other utensils, all in solid silver. (<cite>Missions Catholiques</cite>, No.
      315, 18th June, 1875.)—This periodical gives (p. 293) a sketch of the tomb
      of the Conqueror, according to the account of the two missionaries.</p>

    <p>Prjevalsky (<cite>Mongolia and Tangut</cite>) relates the story of the <em>Khatún
      Gol</em> (see <i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_245">p. 245</a>), and says that her tomb is situated at 11
      versts north-east of lake of Dzaïdemin Nor, and is called by the Mongols
      Tumir-Alku, and by the Chinese Djiou-Djin Fu; one of the legends mentioned
      by the Russian traveller gives the Ordo country as the burial-place of
      Chinghiz, 200 versts south of lake Dabasun Nor; the remains are kept in two
      coffins, one of wood, the other of silver; the Khan prophesied that after
      eight or ten centuries he would come to life again and fight the Emperor of
      China, and being victorious, would take the Mongols from the Ordos back to
      their country of Khalka; Prjevalsky did not see the tomb, nor did Potanin.</p>

    <p>“Their holiest place [of the Mongols of Ordos] is a collection of felt
      tents called ‘Edjen-joro,’ reputed to contain the bones of Jenghiz Khan.
      These sacred relics are entrusted to the care of a caste of Darhats,
      numbering some fifty families. Every summer, on the twenty-first day of
      the sixth moon, sacrifices are offered up in his honour, when numbers
      of people congregate to join in the celebration, such gatherings being
      called <em>táilgan</em>.” On the southern border of the Ordos are the ruins
      of Boro-balgasun [Grey town], said to date from Jenghiz Khan’s time.
      (<cite>Potanin</cite>, <cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> IX. 1887, p. 233.)</p>

    <p>The last traveller who visited the tomb of Chinghiz is M. C. E. Bonin, in
      July 1896; he was then on the banks of the Yellow River in the northern
      part of the Ordo country, which is exclusively inhabited by nomadic and
      pastoral Mongols, forming seven tribes or hords, Djungar, Talat, Wan,
      Ottok, Djassak, Wushun and Hangkin, among which are eastward the Djungar
      and in the centre the Wan; according to their own tradition, these tribes
      descend from the seven armies encamped in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>country at the time of
      Chinghiz’s death; the King of Djungar was 67 years of age, and was the
      chief of all the tribes, being considered the 37th descendant of the
      conqueror in a direct line. His predecessor was the Wushun Wang. M. Bonin
      gives (<cite>Revue de Paris</cite>, 15th February 1898) the following description of
      the tomb and of the country surrounding it. Between the <em>yamen</em> (palace) of
      the King (Wang) of Djungar and the tomb of Chinghiz-Khan, there are five or
      six marches made difficult by the sands of the Gobi, but horses and camels
      may be used for the journey. The road, southward through the desert, passes
      near the great lama-monastery called <em>Barong-tsao</em> or <em>Si-tsao</em> (Monastery
      of the West), and in Chinese <em>San-t’ang sse</em> (Three Temples). This
      celebrated monastery was built by the King of Djungar to hold the tablets
      of his ancestors—on the ruins of an old temple, said to have been erected
      by Chinghiz himself. More than a thousand lamas are registered there, forty
      of them live at the expense of the Emperor of China. Crossing afterwards
      the two upper branches of the Ulan Muren (Red River) on the banks of which
      Chinghiz was murdered, according to local tradition, close to the lake of
      Chahan Nor (White Lake), near which are the tents of the Prince of Wan, one
      arrives at last at the spot called <em>Yeke-Etjen-Koro</em>, in Mongol: the abode
      of the Great Lord, where the tomb is to be found. It is erected to the
      south-east of the village, comprising some twenty tents or tent-like huts
      built of earth. Two large white felt tents, placed side by side, similar
      to the tents of the modern Mongols, but much larger, cover the tomb; a
      red curtain, when drawn, discloses the large and low silver coffin, which
      contains the ashes of the Emperor, placed on the ground of the second tent;
      it is shaped like a big trunk, with great rosaces engraved upon it. The
      Emperor, according to local tradition, was cremated on the bank of the Ulan
      Muren, where he is supposed to have been slain. On the twenty-first day
      of the third moon the anniversary fête of Mongolia takes place; on this
      day of the year only are the two mortuary tents opened, and the coffin is
      exhibited to be venerated by people coming from all parts of Mongolia. Many
      other relics, dispersed all over the Ordo land, are brought thither on this
      occasion; these relics called in Mongol <em>Chinghiz Bogdo</em> (Sacred remains
      of Chinghiz) number ten; they are in the order adopted by the Mongols: the
      saddle of Chinghiz, hidden in the Wan territory; the bow, kept at a place
      named Hu-ki-ta-lao Hei, near Yeke-Etjen-Koro; the remains of his war-horse,
      called Antegan-tsegun (more), preserved at Kebere in the Djungar territory;
      a fire-arm kept in the palace of the King of Djungar; a wooden and leather
      vase called Pao-lao-antri, kept at the place Shien-ni-chente; a wax figure
      containing the ashes of the Khan’s equerry, called Altaqua-tosu, kept at
      Ottok (one of the seven tribes); the remains of the second wife, who lay at
      Kiasa, on the banks of the Yellow River, at a place called on Prjevalsky’s
      map in Chinese Djiou-Djin-fu, and in Mongol Tumir-Alku; the tomb of the
      third wife of Chinghiz, who killed him, and lay to-day at Bagha-Ejen-Koro,
      “the abode of the little Sovereign,” at a day’s march to the south of the
      Djungar King’s palace; the very tomb of Yeke-Etjen-Koro, which is supposed
      to contain also the ashes of the first wife of the Khan; and last, his
      great standard, a black wood spear planted in the desert, more than 150
      miles to the south of the tomb; the iron of it never gets rusty; no one
      dares touch it, and therefore it is not carried to Yeke-Etjen-Koro with the
      other relics for the yearly festival. (See also <cite>Rockhill, Diary</cite>, p. 29.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LI14" href="#NoteAnchor_LI14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—Rashiduddin relates that the escort, in carrying Chinghiz to his
      burial, slew all whom they met, and that forty noble and beautiful girls
      were despatched to serve him in the other world, as well as superb horses.

    <p>Sanang Setzen ignores these barbarities. He describes the body of Chinghiz
      as removed to his native land on a two-wheeled waggon, the whole host
      escorting it, and wailing as they went: “And Kiluken Bahadur of the Sunid

    <p>[“The burying of living men with the dead was a general custom with the
      tribes of Eastern Asia. Favourite servants and wives were usually buried in
      this way. In China, the chief wives and those concubines who had already
      borne children, were exempted from this lot. The Tunguz and other tribes
      were accustomed to kill the selected victims by strangulation. In China
      they used to be buried alive; but the custom of burying living men ceased
      in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1464. [<cite>Hwang ming ts’ung sin lu</cite>.] In the time of the present
      Manchu Dynasty, the burying of living men was prohibited by the Emperor
      Kang-hi, at the close of the 17th century, <i>i.e.</i> the forced burying; but
      voluntary sepulture remained in force [<cite>Yu chi wen</cite>]. Notwithstanding
      this prohibition, cases of forced burying occurred again in remote parts
      of Manchuria; when a concubine refused to follow her deceased master, she
      was forcibly strangled with a bow-string [<em>Ninguta chi</em>]. I must observe,
      however, that there is no mention made in historical documents of the
      existence of this custom with the Mongols; it is only an hypothesis based
      on the analogy between the religious ideas and customs of the Mongols and
      those of other tribes.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 13.)</p>

    <p>In his <cite>Religious System of China</cite>, II., Dr. J. J. M. de Groot devotes a
      whole chapter (ix. 721 <i>seqq.</i>), <cite>Concerning the Sacrifice of Human Beings
      at Burials, and Usages connected therewith</cite>. The oldest case on record in
      China dates as far back as <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 677, when sixty-six men were killed after
      the ruler Wu of the state of Ts’in died.</p>

    <p>The Official Annals of the Tartar Dynasty of Liao, quoted by Professor J.
      J. M. de Groot (<cite>Religious System of China</cite>, vol. ii. 698), state that “in
      the tenth year of the T’ung hwo period (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 692) the killing of horses
      for funeral and burial rites was interdicted, as also the putting into the
      tombs of coats of mail, helmets, and articles and trinkets of gold and
      silver.” Professor de Groot writes (<i>l.c.</i> 709): “But, just as the placing of
      victuals in the graves was at an early date changed into sacrifices of food
      outside the graves, so burying horses with the dead was also modified under
      the Han Dynasty into presenting them to the dead without interring them,
      and valueless counterfeits were on such occasions substituted for the real
      animals.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Customs of the Tartars.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> that we have begun to speak of the Tartars, I have plenty to tell you
    on that subject. The Tartar custom is to spend the winter in warm plains,
    where they find good pasture for their cattle, whilst in summer they betake
    themselves to a cool climate among the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>mountains and valleys, where water
    is to be found as well as woods and pastures.</p>

  <p>Their houses are circular, and are made of wands covered with felts.<a id="NoteAnchor_LII11" href="#Note_LII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a>
    These are carried along with them whithersoever they go; for the wands
    are so strongly bound together, and likewise so well combined, that the
    frame can be made very light. Whenever they erect these huts the door is
    always to the south. They also have waggons covered with black felt so
    efficaciously that no rain can get in. These are drawn by oxen and camels,
    and the women and children travel in them.<a id="NoteAnchor_LII12" href="#Note_LII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> The women do the buying
    and selling, and whatever is necessary to provide for the husband and
    household; for the men all lead the life of gentlemen, troubling themselves
    about nothing but hunting and hawking, and looking after their goshawks and
    falcons, unless it be the practice of warlike exercises.</p>

  <p>They live on the milk and meat which their herds supply, and on the produce
    of the chase; and they eat all kinds of flesh, including that of horses and
    dogs, and Pharaoh’s rats, of which last there are great numbers in burrows
    on those plains.<a id="NoteAnchor_LII13" href="#Note_LII13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> Their drink is mare’s milk.</p>

  <p>They are very careful not to meddle with each other’s wives, and will not
    do so on any account, holding that to be an evil and abominable thing. The
    women too are very good and loyal to their husbands, and notable housewives
    withal.<a id="NoteAnchor_LII14" href="#Note_LII14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> [Ten or twenty of them will dwell together in charming
    peace and unity, nor shall you ever hear an ill word among them.]</p>

  <p>The marriage customs of Tartars are as follows. Any man may take a hundred
    wives an he so please, and if he be able to keep them. But the first wife
    is ever held most in honour, and as the most legitimate [and the same
    applies to the sons whom she may bear]. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>The husband gives a marriage
    payment to his wife’s mother, and the wife brings nothing to her husband.
    They have more children than other people, because they have so many wives.
    They may marry their cousins, and if a father dies, his son may take any
    of the wives, his own mother always excepted; that is to say the eldest
    son may do this, but no other. A man may also take the wife of his own
    brother after the latter’s death. Their weddings are celebrated with great
    ado.<a id="NoteAnchor_LII15" href="#Note_LII15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

      1.</a>—The word here in the G.&nbsp;T. is “<em>fennes</em>,” which seems usually to
      mean <em>ropes</em>, and in fact Pauthier’s text reads: “<i lang="fr">Il ont mesons de verges
      et les cueuvrent de cordes</i>.” Ramusio’s text has <em>feltroni</em>, and both
      Müller and the Latin of the S.&nbsp;G. have <em>filtro</em>. This is certainly the
      right reading. But whether <em>fennes</em> was ever used as a form of <em>feltres</em>
      (as <em>pennes</em> means <em>peltry</em>) I cannot discover. Perhaps some words have
      dropped out. A good description of a Kirghiz hut (35 feet in diameter),
      and exactly corresponding to Polo’s account, will be found in <cite>Atkinson’s
      Siberia</cite>, and another in <cite>Vámbéry’s Travels</cite>. How comfortable and civilised
      the aspect of such a hut may be, can be seen also in Burnes’s account of a
      Turkoman dwelling of this kind. This description of hut or tent is common
      to nearly all the nomade tribes of Central Asia. The trellis-work forming
      the skeleton of the tent-walls is (at least among the Turkomans) loosely
      pivoted, so as to draw out and compress like “lazy-tongs.”</p>

    <p>[Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 56, note) says that he has often seen Mongol
      tents facing east and south-east. He adds: “It is interesting to find it
      noted in the <cite>Chou Shu</cite> (Bk. 50, 3) that the Khan of the Turks, who lived
      always on the Tu-kin mountains, had his tent invariably facing south, so as
      to show reverence to the sun’s rising place.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Ibn Batuta describes the Tartar waggon in which he travelled to Sarai as
      mounted on four great wheels, and drawn by two or more horses:—</p>

    <p>“On the waggon is put a sort of pavilion of wands laced together with
      narrow thongs. It is very light, and is covered with felt or cloth, and
      has latticed windows, so that the person inside can look out without being
      seen. He can change his position at pleasure, sleeping or eating, reading
      or writing, during the journey.” These waggons were sometimes of enormous
      size. Rubruquis declares that he measured between the wheel-tracks of one
      and found the interval to be 20 feet. The axle was like a ship’s mast, and
      twenty-two oxen were yoked to the waggon, eleven abreast. (See opposite
      cut.) He describes the huts as not usually taken to pieces, but carried all
      standing. The waggon just mentioned carried a hut of 30 feet diameter, for
      it projected beyond the wheels at least 5 feet on either side. In fact,
      Carpini says explicitly, “Some of the huts are speedily taken to pieces
      and put up again; such are packed on the beasts. Others cannot be taken to
      pieces, but are carried bodily on the waggons. To carry the smaller tents
      on a waggon one ox may serve; for the larger ones three oxen or four, or
      even more, according to the size.” The carts that were used to transport
      the Tartar valuables were covered with felt soaked in tallow or ewe’s milk,
      to make them waterproof. The tilts of these were rectangular, in the form
      of a large trunk. The carts used in Kashgar, as described by Mr. Shaw, seem
      to resemble these latter. (<cite>I. B.</cite> II. 381–382; <cite>Rub.</cite> 221; <cite>Carp.</cite> 6, 16.)</p>

    <p>The words of Herodotus, speaking generally of the Scyths, apply perfectly
      to the Mongol hordes under Chinghiz: “Having neither cities nor forts, and
      carrying their dwellings with them wherever they go; accustomed, moreover,
      one and all, to shoot from horseback; and living not by husbandry but on
      their cattle, their waggons the only houses that they possess, how can they
      fail of being unconquerable?” (Bk. IV. ch. 46, p. 41, <cite>Rawlins.</cite>) Scythian
      prisoners in their waggons are represented on the Column of Theodosius at
      Constantinople; but it is difficult to believe that these waggons, at least
      as figured in Banduri, have any really Scythian character.</p>

    <p>It is a curious fact that the practice of carrying these <em>yurts</em> or felt
      tents upon waggons appears to be entirely obsolete in Mongolia. Mr. Ney
      Elias writes: “I frequently showed your picture [that opposite] to Mongols,
      Chinese, and Russian border-traders, but none had ever seen anything of
      the kind. The only cart I have ever seen used by Mongols is a little low,
      light, roughly-made bullock-dray, <em>certainly</em> of Chinese importation.” The
      old system would, however, appear to have been kept up to our own times by
      the Nogai Tartars, near the Sea of Azof. (See note from Heber, in <cite>Clark’s
      Travels</cite>, 8vo ed. I. 440, and Dr. Clark’s vignette at p. 394 in the same
      volume.)</p>

      Siberia, called <em>Alactaga</em>, and a kind of Kangaroo-rat (probably the same)
      is mentioned as very abundant on the Mongolian Steppe. There is also the
      <em>Zieselmaus</em> of Pallas, a Dormouse, I believe, which he says the Kalmaks,
      even of distinction, count a delicacy, especially cooked in sour milk.
      “They eat not only the flesh of all their different kinds of cattle,
      including horses and camels, but also that of many wild animals which other
      nations eschew, <i>e.g.</i> marmots and <em>zieselmice</em>, beavers, badgers, otters,
      and lynxes, leaving none untouched except the dog and weasel kind, and also
      (unless <em>very</em> hard pressed) the flesh of the fox and the wolf.” (<cite>Pallas,

      Regarding the marmots called <em>Sogur</em> by Rubruquis, Mr. Rockhill writes (p.
      69): “Probably the <i>Mus citillus</i>, the <em>Suslik</em> of the Russians.... M.
      Grenard tells me that <em>Soghur</em>, more usually written <em>sour</em> in Turki, is
      the ordinary name of the marmot.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      the first manages the domestic concerns, and is the most respected.”
      (<cite>Timk.</cite> II. 310.) Naturally Polygamy is not so general among the Mongols
      as when Asia lay at their feet. The Buraets, who seem to retain the old
      Mongol customs in great completeness, are polygamists, and have as many
      wives as they choose. Polygamy is also very prevalent among the Yakuts,
      whose lineage seems to be Eastern Turk. (<cite>Ritter</cite>, III. 125; <cite>Erman</cite>, II. 346.)</p>

    <p>Of the custom that entitled the son on succeeding to take such as he

      (see <cite>Prologue</cite>, <a href="#Note_XVIIp2">ch. xvii. note 2</a>), and many instances will be found in
      Hammer’s or other Mongol Histories. The same custom seems to be ascribed
      by Herodotus to the Scyths (IV. 78). A number of citations regarding the
      practice are given by Quatremère. (<cite>Q. R.</cite> p. 92.) A modern Mongol writer
      in the <cite>Mélanges Asiatiques</cite> of the Petersburg Academy, states that the
      custom of taking a deceased brother’s wives is now obsolete, but that a
      proverb preserves its memory (II. 656). It is the custom of some Mahomedan
      nations, notably of the Afghans, and is one of those points that have been
      cited as a supposed proof of their Hebrew lineage.</p>

    <p>“The Kalin is a present which the Bridegroom or his parents make to the

      introduction among the Mongols; indeed, at the end of the chapter, Polo
      speaks of their new adoption of the Chinese idolatry, <i>i.e.</i> Buddhism. We may
      add here that the Buddhism of the Mongols decayed and became practically
      extinct after their expulsion from China (1368–1369). The old Shamanism
      then apparently revived; nor was it till 1577 that the great reconversion
      of Mongolia to Lamaism began. This reconversion is the most prominent event

      Setzen, Prince of the Ordos, was a chief agent in the movement.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Good Spirit appears to have been called by the Mongols <em>Tengri</em>
      (Heaven), and <em>Khormuzda</em>, and is identified by Schmidt with the Persian
      Hormuzd. In Buddhist times he became identified with Indra.</p>

    <p>Plano Carpini’s account of this matter is very like Marco’s: “They believe
      in one God, the Maker of all things, visible and invisible, and the
      Distributor of good and evil in this world; but they worship Him not with
      prayers or praises or any kind of service. Natheless, they have certain
      idols of felt, imitating the human face, and having underneath the face
      something resembling teats; these they place on either side of the door.
      These they believe to be the guardians of the flocks, from whom they have
      the boons of milk and increase. Others they fabricate of bits of silk, and
      these are highly honoured; ... and whenever they begin to eat or drink, they
      first offer these idols a portion of their food or drink.”</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

    <p>The account agrees generally with what we are told of the original
      Shamanism of the Tunguses, which recognizes a Supreme Power over all, and
      a small number of potent spirits called <em>Ongot</em>. These spirits among the
      Buraets are called, according to one author, <em>Nougait</em> or <em>Nogat</em>, and
      according to Erman <em>Ongotui</em>. In some form of this same word, <em>Nogait</em>,
      <em>Ongot</em>, <em>Onggod</em>, <em>Ongotui</em>, we are, I imagine, to trace the <em>Natigay</em> of Polo.
      The modern representative of this Shamanist <em>Lar</em> is still found among the
      Buraets, and is thus described by Pallas under the name of <em>Immegiljin</em>:
      “He is honoured as the tutelary god of the sheep and other cattle.
      Properly, the divinity consists of <em>two</em> figures, hanging side by side, one
      of whom represents the god’s wife. These two figures are merely a pair of
      lanky flat bolsters with the upper part shaped into a round disk, and the
      body hung with a long woolly fleece; eyes, nose, breasts, and navel, being
      indicated by leather knobs stitched on. The male figure commonly has at
      his girdle the foot-rope with which horses at pasture are fettered, whilst
      the female, which is sometimes accompanied by smaller figures representing
      her children, has all sorts of little nicknacks and sewing implements.”
      Galsang Czomboyef, a recent Russo-Mongol writer already quoted, says also:
      “Among the Buryats, in the middle of the hut and place of honour, is the
      <em>Dsaiagaçhi</em> or ‘Chief Creator of Fortune.’ At the door is the <em>Emelgelji</em>,
      the Tutelary of the Herds and Young Cattle, made of sheepskins. Outside
      the hut is the <em>Chandaghatu</em>, a name implying that the idol was formed of
      a white hare-skin, the Tutelary of the Chase and perhaps of War. All these
      have been expelled by Buddhism except Dsaiagachi, who is called <em>Tengri</em>,
      and introduced among the Buddhist divinities.”</p>

    <p>[Dorji Banzaroff, in his dissertation <cite>On the Black Religion</cite>, <i>i.e.</i>
      Shamanism, 1846, “is disposed to see in Natigay of M. Polo, the Ytoga
      of other travellers, <i>i.e.</i> the Mongol <em>Etugen</em>—‘earth,’ as the object of
      veneration of the Mongol Shamans. They look upon it as a divinity, for
      its power as <em>Delegei in echen</em>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘the Lord of Earth,’ and on account
      of its productiveness, <em>Altan delegei</em>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘Golden Earth.’” Palladius
      (<i>l.c.</i> pp. 14–16) adds one new variant to what the learned Colonel Yule has
      collected and set forth with such precision, on the Shaman household gods.
      “The Dahurs and Barhus have in their dwellings, according to the number
      of the male <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>members of the family, puppets made of straw, on which eyes,
      eyebrows, and mouth are drawn; these puppets are dressed up to the waist.
      When some one of the family dies, his puppet is taken out of the house,
      and a new puppet is made for every newly-born member of the family. On New
      Year’s Day offerings are made to the puppets, and care is taken not to
      disturb them (by moving them, etc.), in order to avoid bringing sickness
      upon the family.” (<cite>He lung kiang wai ki</cite>.)</p>

    <p>(Cf. <cite>Rubruck</cite>, 58–59, and Mr. Rockhill’s note, 59–60.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LIII12" href="#NoteAnchor_LIII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—<span class="smcap">Kimiz</span> or <span class="smcap">Kumiz</span>, the habitual drink of the Mongols, as it still is
      of most of the nomads of Asia. It is thus made. Fresh mare’s milk is put
      in a well-seasoned bottle-necked vessel of horse-skin; a little <em>kurút</em>
      (see <a href="#Note_LIV15">note 5, ch. liv.</a>) or some sour cow’s milk is added; and when acetous
      fermentation is commencing it is violently churned with a peculiar staff
      which constantly stands in the vessel. This interrupts fermentation and
      introduces a quantity of air into the liquid. It is customary for visitors
      who may drop in to give a turn or two at the churn-stick. After three or
      four days the drink is ready.</p>

    <p>Kumiz keeps long; it is wonderfully tonic and nutritious, and it is said
      that it has cured many persons threatened with consumption. The tribes
      using it are said to be remarkably free from pulmonary disease; and indeed
      I understand there is a regular <em>Galactopathic</em> establishment somewhere in
      the province of Orenburg for treating pulmonary patients with Kumiz diet.</p>

    <p>It has a peculiar fore- and after-taste which, it is said, everybody does
      not like. Yet I have found no confession of a dislike to Kumiz. Rubruquis
      tells us it is pungent on the tongue, like <i lang="la">vinum raspei</i> (<i lang="fr">vin rapé</i> of
      the French), whilst you are drinking it, but leaves behind a pleasant
      flavour like milk of almonds. It makes a man’s inside feel very cosy, he
      adds, even turning a weak head, and is strongly diuretic. To this last
      statement, however, modern report is in direct contradiction. The Greeks
      and other Oriental Christians considered it a sort of denial of the faith
      to drink Kumiz. On the other hand, the Mahomedan converts from the nomad
      tribes seem to have adhered to the use of Kumiz even when strict in
      abstinence from wine; and it was indulged in by the early Mamelukes as a
      public solemnity. Excess on such an occasion killed Bibars Bundukdari, who
      was passionately fond of this liquor.</p>

    <p>The intoxicating power of Kumiz varies according to the <em>brew</em>. The more
      advanced is the vinous fermentation the less acid is the taste and the more
      it sparkles. The effect, however, is always slight and transitory, and
      leaves no unpleasant sensation, whilst it produces a strong tendency to
      refreshing sleep. If its good qualities amount to half what are ascribed
      to it by Dr. W. F. Dahl, from whom we derive some of these particulars, it
      must be the pearl of all beverages. “With the nomads it is the drink of all
      from the suckling upwards, it is the solace of age and illness, and the
      greatest of treats to all!”</p>

    <p>There was a special kind called <em>Ḳará Ḳumiz</em>, which is mentioned both by
      Rubruquis and in the history of Wassáf. It seems to have been strained and
      clarified. The modern Tartars distil a spirit from Kumiz of which Pallas
      gives a detailed account. (<cite>Dahl, Ueber den Kumyss</cite> in <cite>Baer’s Beiträge</cite>,

      <cite>Gold. Horde</cite>, p. 46; <cite>Erman</cite>, I. 296; <cite>Pallas, Samml.</cite> I. 132 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>

    <p>[In the <cite>Si yu ki</cite>, Travels to the West of Ch’ang ch’un, we find a drink
      called <em>tung lo</em>. “The Chinese characters, <em>tung lo</em>,” says Bretschneider
      (<cite>Med. Res.</cite> I. 94), “denote according to the dictionaries preparations
      from mare’s or cow’s milk, as Kumis, sour milk, etc. In the <cite>Yüan shi</cite> (ch.
      cxxviii.) biography of the Kipchak prince <em>Tú-tú-ha</em>, it is stated that
      ‘black mare’s milk’ (evidently the cara cosmos of Rubruck), very pleasant
      to the taste, used to be sent from Kipchak to the Mongol court in China.”
      (On the drinks of the Mongols, see Mr. Rockhill’s note, <cite>Rubruck</cite>, p.
      62.)—The Mongols indulge in sour milk (<em>tarak</em>) and distilled mare’s milk
      (<em>arreki</em>), but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Land of the Lamas</cite>, 130) says he never saw
      them drink <em>kumiz</em>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The mare’s-milk drink of Scythian nomads is alluded to by many ancient
      authors. But the manufacture of Kumiz is particularly spoken of by
      Herodotus. “The (mare’s) milk is poured into deep wooden casks, about which
      the blind slaves are placed, and then the milk is stirred round. That which
      rises to the top is drawn off, and considered the best part; the under
      portion is of less account.” Strabo also speaks of the nomads beyond the
      Cimmerian Chersonesus, who feed on horse-flesh and other flesh, mare’s-milk
      cheese, mare’s milk, and sour milk (<span lang="el">ὀξυγάλακτα</span>) “<em>which they have
      a particular way of preparing</em>.” Perhaps Herodotus was mistaken about
      the wooden tubs. At least all modern attempts to use anything but the
      orthodox skins have failed. Priscus, in his narrative of the mission of
      himself and Maximin to Attila, says the Huns brought them a drink made from
      <em>barley</em> which they called <span lang="el">Κάμος</span>. The barley was, no doubt, a
      misapprehension of his. (<cite>Herod.</cite> Bk. iv. p. 2, in <cite>Rawl.</cite>; <cite>Strabo</cite>, VII.

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Tartar Customs of War.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> their harness of war is excellent and costly. Their arms are bows
    and arrows, sword and mace; but above all the bow, for they are capital
    archers, indeed the best that are known. On their backs they wear armour
    of cuirbouly, prepared from buffalo and other hides, which is very
    strong.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIV11" href="#Note_LIV11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> They are excellent soldiers, and passing valiant in battle.
    They are also more capable of hardships than other nations; for many a
    time, if need be, they will go for a month without any supply of food,
    living only on the milk of their mares and on such game as their bows may
    win them. Their horses also will subsist entirely on the grass of the
    plains, so that there is no need to carry store of barley or straw or oats;
    and they are very docile to their riders. These, in case of need, will
    abide on horseback the livelong night, armed at all points, while the horse
    will be continually grazing.</p>

  <p>Of all troops in the world these are they which endure the greatest
    hardship and fatigue, and which cost <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>the least; and they are the best of
    all for making wide conquests of country. And this you will perceive from
    what you have heard and shall hear in this book; and (as a fact) there can
    be no manner of doubt that now they are the masters of the biggest half of
    the world. Their troops are admirably ordered in the manner that I shall
    now relate.</p>

  <p>You see, when a Tartar prince goes forth to war, he takes with him, say,
    100,000 horse. Well, he appoints an officer to every ten men, one to every
    hundred, one to every thousand, and one to every ten thousand, so that his
    own orders have to be given to ten persons only, and each of these ten
    persons has to pass the orders only to other ten, and so on; no one having
    to give orders to more than ten. And every one in turn is responsible only
    to the officer immediately over him; and the discipline and order that
    comes of this method is marvellous, for they are a people very obedient to
    their chiefs. Further, they call the corps of 100,000 men a <em>Tuc</em>; that of
    10,000 they call a <em>Toman</em>; the thousand they call ...; the hundred <em>Guz</em>;
    the ten ....<a id="NoteAnchor_LIV12" href="#Note_LIV12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> And when the army is on the march they have always 200
    horsemen, very well mounted, who are sent a distance of two marches in
    advance to reconnoitre, and these always keep ahead. They have a similar
    party detached in the rear, and on either flank, so that there is a good
    look-out kept on all sides against a surprise. When they are going on a
    distant expedition they take no gear with them except two leather bottles
    for milk; a little earthenware pot to cook their meat in, and a little tent
    to shelter them from rain.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIV13" href="#Note_LIV13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> And in case of great urgency they will
    ride ten days on end without lighting a fire or taking a meal. On such an
    occasion they will sustain themselves on the blood of their horses, opening
    a vein and letting the blood jet into their mouths, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>drinking till they have
    had enough, and then staunching it.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIV14" href="#Note_LIV14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>They also have milk dried into a kind of paste to carry with them; and when
    they need food they put this in water, and beat it up till it dissolves,
    and then drink it. [It is prepared in this way; they boil the milk, and
    when the rich part floats on the top they skim it into another vessel, and
    of that they make butter; for the milk will not become solid till this is
    removed. Then they put the milk in the sun to dry. And when they go on
    an expedition, every man takes some ten pounds of this dried milk with
    him. And of a morning he will take a half pound of it and put it in his
    leather bottle, with as much water as he pleases. So, as he rides along,
    the milk-paste and the water in the bottle get well churned together into a
    kind of pap, and that makes his dinner.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIV15" href="#Note_LIV15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a>]</p>

  <p>When they come to an engagement with the enemy, they will gain the victory
    in this fashion. [They never let themselves get into a regular medley, but
    keep perpetually riding round and shooting into the enemy. And] as they do
    not count it any shame to run away in battle, they will [sometimes pretend
    to] do so, and in running away they turn in the saddle and shoot hard and
    strong at the foe, and in this way make great havoc. Their horses are
    trained so perfectly that they will double hither and thither, just like a
    dog, in a way that is quite astonishing. Thus they fight to as good purpose
    in running away as if they stood and faced the enemy, because of the vast
    volleys of arrows that they shoot in this way, turning round upon their
    pursuers, who are fancying that they have won the battle. But when the
    Tartars see that they have killed and wounded a good many horses and men,
    they wheel round bodily, and return to the charge in perfect order and with
    loud cries; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>and in a very short time the enemy are routed. In truth they
    are stout and valiant soldiers, and inured to war. And you perceive that it
    is just when the enemy sees them run, and imagines that he has gained the
    battle, that he has in reality lost it; for the Tartars wheel round in a
    moment when they judge the right time has come. And after this fashion they
    have won many a fight.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIV16" href="#Note_LIV16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <p>All this that I have been telling you is true of the manners and customs
    of the genuine Tartars. But I must add also that in these days they are
    greatly degenerated; for those who are settled in Cathay have taken up the
    practices of the Idolaters of the country, and have abandoned their own
    institutions; whilst those who have settled in the Levant have adopted the
    customs of the Saracens.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIV17" href="#Note_LIV17" class="fnanchor">{7}</a></p>

      obtained from the Malays or Arabs.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LIV12" href="#NoteAnchor_LIV12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—M. Pauthier has judiciously pointed out the omissions that have
      occurred here, perhaps owing to Rusticiano’s not properly catching the
      foreign terms applied to the various grades. In the G. Text the passage
      runs: “<em>Et sachiés que les cent mille est apellé un</em> Tut (read <em>tuc</em>)
      <em>et les dix mille un</em> Toman, <em>et les por milier et por centenier et por
      desme</em>.” In Pauthier’s (uncorrected) text one of the missing words is
      supplied: “<em>Et appellent les C.M. un</em> Tuc; <em>et les X.M. un</em> Toman; <em>et un
      millier</em> Guz <em>por centenier et por disenier</em>.” The blanks he supplies thus
      from Abulghazi: “<em>Et un millier</em>: [un Miny]; <em>Guz, por centenier et</em> [Un]
      <em>por disenier</em>.” The words supplied are Turki, but so is the <em>Guz</em>, which
      appears already in Pauthier’s text, whilst <em>Toman</em> and <em>Tuc</em> are common
      to Turki and Mongol. The latter word, <em>Túk</em> or <em>Túgh</em>, is the horse-tail
      or yak-tail standard which among so many Asiatic nations has marked the
      supreme military command. It occurs as <em>Taka</em> in ancient Persian, and
      Cosmas Indicopleustes speaks of it as <em>Tupha</em>. The Nine Orloks or Marshals
      under Chinghiz were entitled to the <em>Tuk</em>, and theirs is probably the class
      of command here indicated as of 100,000, though the figure must not be
      strictly taken. Timur ordains that every Amir who should conquer a kingdom
      or command in a victory should receive a title of honour, the <em>Tugh</em> and
      the <em>Naḳḳárá</em>. (<i>infra</i>, <a href="#Note_IV23">Bk. II. ch. iv. note 3</a>.) Baber on several occasions
      speaks of conferring the <em>Tugh</em> upon his generals for distinguished
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>service. One of the military titles at Bokhara is still <em>Tokhsabai</em>, a
      corruption of <em>Túgh-Sáhibi</em> (Master of the Tugh).</p>

    <p>We find the whole gradation except the <em>Tuc</em> in a rescript of Janibeg, Khan
      of Sarai, in favour of Venetian merchants dated February 1347. It begins
      in the Venetian version: “<em>La parola de Zanibeck allo puovolo di Mogoli,
      alli</em> Baroni di Thomeni,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> delli miera, delli centenera, delle dexiene.”
      (<cite>Erdmann</cite>, 576; <cite>D’Avezac</cite>, 577–578; <cite>Rémusat, Langues Tartares</cite>,
      303; <cite>Pallas, Samml.</cite> I. 283; <cite>Schmidt</cite>, 379, 381; <cite>Baber</cite>, 260, etc.;

      Chartes</cite>, tom. lv. p. 585.)</p>

    <p>The decimal division of the army was already made by Chinghiz at an early
      period of his career, and was probably much older than his time. In fact
      we find the Myriarch and Chiliarch already in the Persian armies of Darius
      Hystaspes. From the Tartars the system passed into nearly all the Musulman
      States of Asia, and the titles <em>Min-bashi</em> or <em>Bimbashi</em>, <em>Yuzbashi</em>,
      <em>Onbashi</em>, still subsist not only in Turkestan, but also in Turkey and
      Persia. The term <em>Tman</em> or <em>Tma</em> was, according to Herberstein, still used
      in Russia in his day for 10,000. (<cite>Ramus.</cite> II. 159.)</p>

    <p>[The King of An-nam, Dinh Tiên-hòang (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 968) had an army of 1,000,000
      men forming 10 corps of 10 legions; each legion forming 10 cohorts of 10

      distinctly: “Ich hon och gesehen wann sie in reiss ylten, das sie ein
      fleisch nemen, und es dunn schinden und legents unter den sattel, und riten
      doruff; und essents wann sie hungert” (ch. 35). Botero had “heard from a
      trustworthy source that a Tartar of Perekop, travelling on the steppes,
      lived for some days on the blood of his horse, and then, not daring to
      bleed it more, cut off and ate its <em>ears</em>!” (<cite>Relazione Univers.</cite> p. 93.)
      The Turkmans speak of such practices, but Conolly says he came to regard
      them as hyperbolical talk (I. 45).</p>

    <p>[Abul-Ghazi Khan, in his History of Mongols, describing a raid of Russian
      (<em>Ourous</em>) Cossacks, who were hemmed in by the Uzbeks, says: “The Russians
      had in continued fighting exhausted all their water. They began to drink
      blood; the fifth day they had not even blood remaining to drink.” (<cite>Transl.

      5.</a>—Rubruquis thus describes this preparation, which is called <em>Kurút</em>:
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>“The milk that remains after the butter has been made, they allow to get
      as sour as sour can be, and then boil it. In boiling, it curdles, and that
      curd they dry in the sun; and in this way it becomes as hard as iron-slag.
      And so it is stored in bags against the winter. In the winter time, when
      they have no milk, they put that sour curd, which they call <em>Griut</em>,
      into a skin, and pour warm water on it, and they shake it violently till
      the curd dissolves in the water, to which it gives an acid flavour; that
      water they drink in place of milk. But above all things they eschew
      drinking plain water.” From Pallas’s account of the modern practice, which
      is substantially the same, these cakes are also made from the leavings
      of distillation in making milk-arrack. The Kurút is frequently made of
      ewe-milk. Wood speaks of it as an indispensable article in the food of the
      people of Badakhshan, and under the same name it is a staple food of the
      Afghans. (<cite>Rubr.</cite> 229; <cite>Samml.</cite> I. 136; <cite>Dahl</cite>, u.s.; <cite>Wood</cite>, 311.)</p>

    <p>[It is the <em>ch’ura</em> of the Tibetans. “In the Kokonor country and Tibet,
      this <em>krut</em> or <em>chura</em> is put in tea to soften, and then eaten either alone
      or mixed with parched barley meal (<em>tsamba</em>).” (<cite>Rockhill, Rubruck</cite>, p. 68,
      note.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LIV16" href="#NoteAnchor_LIV16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—Compare with Marco’s account the report of the Mongols, which was
      brought by the spies of Mahomed, Sultan of Khwarizm, when invasion was
      first menaced by Chinghiz: “The army of Chinghiz is countless, as a swarm
      of ants or locusts. Their warriors are matchless in lion-like valour, in
      obedience, and endurance. They take no rest, and flight or retreat is
      unknown to them. On their expeditions they are accompanied by oxen, sheep,
      camels, and horses, and sweet or sour milk suffices them for food. Their
      horses scratch the earth with their hoofs and feed on the roots and grasses
      they dig up, so that they need neither straw nor oats. They themselves
      reck nothing of the clean or the unclean in food, and eat the flesh of all
      animals, even of dogs, swine, and bears. They will open a horse’s vein,
      draw blood, and drink it.... In victory they leave neither small nor great
      alive; they cut up women great with child and cleave the fruit of the womb.
      If they come to a great river, as they know nothing of boats, they sew
      skins together, stitch up all their goods therein, tie the bundle to their
      horses’ tails, mount with a hard grip of the mane, and so swim over.” This
      passage is an absolute abridgment of many chapters of Carpini. Still more
      terse was the sketch of Mongol proceedings drawn by a fugitive from Bokhara
      after Chinghiz’s devastations there. It was set forth in one unconscious
      hexameter:</p>

    <div class="center-container">

        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“<i>Ámdand u khandand u sokhtand u kushtand u burdand u raftand!</i>”</div>
          <div class="i0">“They came and they sapped, they fired and they slew, trussed up their loot and were gone!”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Juwaini, the historian, after telling the story, adds: “The cream and
      essence of whatever is written in this volume might be represented in these
      few words.”</p>

    <p>A Musulman author quoted by Hammer, Najmuddin of Rei, gives an awful
      picture of the Tartar devastations, “Such as had never been heard of,
      whether in the lands of unbelief or of Islam, and can only be likened to
      those which the Prophet announced as signs of the Last Day, when he said:
      ‘The Hour of Judgment shall not come until ye shall have fought with the
      Turks, men small of eye and ruddy of countenance, whose noses are flat,
      and their faces like hide-covered shields. Those shall be Days of Horror!’
      ‘And what meanest thou by horror?’ said the Companions; and he replied,
      ‘<span class="smcap">Slaughter! Slaughter!</span>’ This beheld the Prophet in vision 600 years ago.
      And could there well be worse slaughter than there was in Rei, where I,
      wretch that I am, was born and bred, and where the whole population of five
      hundred thousand souls was either butchered or dragged into slavery?”</p>

    <p>Marco habitually suppresses or ignores the frightful brutalities of the
      Tartars, but these were somewhat less, no doubt, in Kúblái’s time.</p>

    <p>The Hindustani poet Amir Khosru gives a picture of the Mongols more
      forcible than elegant, which Elliot has translated (III. 528).</p>

    <p>This is Hayton’s account of the Parthian tactics of the Tartars: “They
      will run away, but always keeping their companies together; and it is very
      dangerous to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>give them chase, for as they flee they shoot back over their
      heads, and do great execution among their pursuers. They keep very close
      rank, so that you would not guess them for half their real strength.”
      Carpini speaks to the same effect. Baber, himself of Mongol descent, but
      heartily hating his kindred, gives this account of their military usage in
      his day: “Such is the uniform practice of these wretches the Moghuls; if
      they defeat the enemy they instantly seize the booty; if they are defeated,
      they plunder and dismount their own allies, and, betide what may, carry off
      the spoil.” (<cite>Erdmann</cite>, 364, 383, 620; <cite>Gold. Horde</cite>, 77, 80; <cite>Elliot</cite>, II.

      says Nicephorus Gregoras, “from converse with the Assyrians, Persians, and
      Chaldæans, in time acquired their manners and adopted their religion,
      casting off their ancestral atheism.... And to such a degree were they
      changed, that though in former days they had been wont to cover the head
      with nothing better than a loose felt cap, and for other clothing had
      thought themselves well off with the skins of wild beasts or ill-dressed
      leather, and had for weapons only clubs and slings, or spears, arrows, and
      bows extemporised from the oaks and other trees of their mountains and
      forests, now, forsooth, they will have no meaner clothing than brocades of
      silk and gold! And their luxury and delicate living came to such a pitch
      that they stood far as the poles asunder from their original habits” (II. v. 6).</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the administering of Justice among the Tartars.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> way they administer justice is this. When any one has committed a
    petty theft, they give him, under the orders of authority, seven blows of
    a stick, or seventeen, or twenty-seven, or thirty-seven, or forty-seven,
    and so forth, always increasing by tens in proportion to the injury done,
    and running up to one hundred and seven. Of these beatings sometimes they
    die.<a id="NoteAnchor_LV1" href="#Note_LV1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> But if the offence be horse-stealing, or some other great
    matter, they cut the thief in two with a sword. Howbeit, if he be able to
    ransom himself by paying nine times the value of the thing stolen, he is
    let off. Every Lord or other person who possesses beasts has them marked
    with his peculiar brand, be they horses, mares, camels, oxen, cows, or
    other great cattle, and then they are sent abroad to graze over the plains
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>without any keeper. They get all mixt together, but eventually every beast
    is recovered by means of its owner’s brand, which is known. For their sheep
    and goats they have shepherds. All their cattle are remarkably fine, big,
    and in good condition.<a id="NoteAnchor_LV2" href="#Note_LV2" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>They have another notable custom, which is this. If any man have a daughter
    who dies before marriage, and another man have had a son also die before
    marriage, the parents of the two arrange a grand wedding between the dead
    lad and lass. And marry them they do, making a regular contract! And when
    the contract papers are made out they put them in the fire, in order (as
    they will have it) that the parties in the other world may know the fact,
    and so look on each other as man and wife. And the parents thenceforward
    consider themselves sib to each other, just as if their children had lived
    and married. Whatever may be agreed on between the parties as dowry, those
    who have to pay it cause to be painted on pieces of paper and then put
    these in the fire, saying that in that way the dead person will get all the
    real articles in the other world.<a id="NoteAnchor_LV3" href="#Note_LV3" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>Now I have told you all about the manners and customs of the Tartars; but
    you have heard nothing yet of the great state of the Grand Kaan, who is the
    Lord of all the Tartars and of the Supreme Imperial Court. All that I will
    tell you in this book in proper time and place, but meanwhile I must return
    to my story which I left off in that great plain when we began to speak of
    the Tartars.<a id="NoteAnchor_LV4" href="#Note_LV4" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_LV1" href="#NoteAnchor_LV1" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The cudgel among the Mongols was not confined to thieves and such
      like. It was the punishment also of military and state offences, and
      even princes were liable to it without fatal disgrace. “If they give any
      offence,” says Carpini, “or omit to obey the slightest beck, the Tartars
      themselves are beaten like donkeys.” The number of blows administered was,
      according to Wassáf, always odd, 3, 5, and so forth, up to 77. (<cite>Carp.</cite>
      712; <cite>Ilchan.</cite> I. 37.)</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

    <p>[“They also punish with death grand larceny, but as for petty thefts, such
      as that of a sheep, so long as one has not repeatedly been taken in the
      act, they beat him cruelly, and if they administer an hundred blows they
      must use an hundred sticks.” (<cite>Rockhill, Rubruck</cite>, p. 80.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LV2" href="#NoteAnchor_LV2" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—“They have no herdsmen or others to watch their cattle, because the
      laws of the Turks (<i>i.e.</i> Tartars) against theft are so severe.... A man in
      whose possession a stolen horse is found is obliged to restore it to its
      owner, <em>and to give nine of the same value</em>; if he cannot, his children are
      seized in compensation; if he have no children, he is slaughtered like a
      mutton.” (<cite>Ibn Batuta</cite>, II. 364.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LV3" href="#NoteAnchor_LV3" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—This is a Chinese custom, though no doubt we may trust Marco
      for its being a Tartar one also. “In the province of Shansi they have a
      ridiculous custom, which is to marry dead folks to each other. F. Michael
      Trigault, a Jesuit, who lived several years in that province, told it us
      whilst we were in confinement. It falls out that one man’s son and another
      man’s daughter die. Whilst the coffins are in the house (and they used to
      keep them two or three years, or longer) the parents agree to marry them;
      they send the usual presents, as if the pair were alive, with much ceremony
      and music. After this they put the two coffins together, hold the wedding
      dinner in their presence, and, lastly, lay them together in one tomb. The
      parents, from this time forth, are looked on not merely as friends but as
      relatives—just as they would have been had their children been married when
      in life.” (<cite>Navarrete</cite>, quoted by <cite>Marsden.</cite>) Kidd likewise, speaking of
      the Chinese custom of worshipping at the tombs of progenitors, says: “So
      strongly does veneration for this tribute after death prevail that parents,
      in order to secure the memorial of the sepulchre for a daughter who has
      died during her betrothal, give her in marriage after her decease to her
      intended husband, who receives with nuptial ceremonies at his own house
      a paper effigy made by her parents, and after he has burnt it, erects a
      tablet to her memory—an honour which usage forbids to be rendered to the
      memory of unmarried persons. The law seeks without effect to abolish this
      absurd custom.” (<cite>China</cite>, etc., pp. 179–180.)</p>

    <p>[Professor J. J. M. de Groot (<cite>Religious System of China</cite>) gives several
      instances of marriages after death; the following example (II. 804–805)
      will illustrate the custom: “An interesting account of the manner in
      which such <em>post-mortem</em> marriages were concluded at the period when the
      Sung Dynasty governed the Empire, is given by a contemporary work in the
      following words: ‘In the northern parts of the Realm it is customary, when
      an unmarried youth and an unmarried girl breathe their last, that the two
      families each charge a match-maker to demand the other party in marriage.
      Such go-betweens are called match-makers for disembodied souls. They
      acquaint the two families with each other’s circumstances, and then cast
      lots for the marriage by order of the parents on both sides. If they augur
      that the union will be a happy one, (wedding) garments for the next world
      are cut out, and the match-makers repair to the grave of the lad, there
      to set out wine and fruit for the consummation of the marriage. Two seats
      are placed side by side, and a small streamer is set up near each seat.
      If these streamers move a little after the libation has been performed,
      the souls are believed to approach each other; but if one of them does
      not move, the party represented thereby is considered to disapprove of
      the marriage. Each family has to reward its match-maker with a present
      of woven stuffs. Such go-betweens make a regular livelihood out of these
      proceedings.’”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The Ingushes of the Caucasus, according to Klaproth, have the same custom:
      “If a man’s son dies, another who has lost his daughter goes to the father
      and says, ‘Thy son will want a wife in the other world; I will give him my
      daughter; pay me the price of the bride.’ Such a demand is never refused,
      even though the purchase of the bride amount to thirty cows.” (<cite>Travels,
      Eng. Trans.</cite> 345.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LV4" href="#NoteAnchor_LV4" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—There is a little doubt about the reading of this last paragraph.
      The G.&nbsp;T. has—“<em>Mès <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>desormès volun retorner à nostre conte en</em> la grant
      plaingne <em>où nos estion quant nos comechames des fais des Tartars</em>,” whilst
      Pauthier’s text has “<em>Mais desormais vueil retourner à mon conte que Je
      lessai</em> d’or plain <em>quant nous commençames des faiz des Tatars.”</em> The
      former reading looks very like a misunderstanding of one similar to the
      latter, where <em>d’or plain</em> seems to be an adverbial expression, with some
      such meaning as “just now,” “a while ago.” I have not, however, been able
      to trace the expression elsewhere. Cotgrave has <em>or primes</em>, “but even
      now,” etc.; and has also <em>de plain</em>, “presently, immediately, out of hand.”
      It seems quite possible that <em>d’or plain</em> should have had the meaning
      suggested.</p>

    the Great Kaan. They have neither corn nor wine. [They get birds for food,
    for the country is full of lakes and pools and marshes, which are much

    <p><a id="Note_LVI11" href="#NoteAnchor_LVI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The readings differ as to the length of the journey. In Pauthier’s
      text we seem to have first a journey of forty days from near Karakorúm to
      the Plain of Bargu, and then a journey of forty days more across the plain
      to the Northern Ocean. The G.&nbsp;T. seems to present only <em>one</em> journey of
      forty days (Ramusio, of sixty days), but leaves the interval from Karakorúm
      undefined. I have followed the former, though with some doubt.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVI12" href="#NoteAnchor_LVI12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—This paragraph from Ramusio replaces the following in Pauthier’s
      text: “In the summer they got abundance of game, both beasts and birds, but
      in winter, there is none to be had because of the great cold.”</p>

    <p>Marco is here dealing, I apprehend, with hearsay geography, and, as is
      common in like cases, there is great compression of circumstances and
      characteristics, analogous to the like compression of little-known regions
      in mediæval maps.</p>

    <p>The name <em>Bargu</em> appears to be the same with that often mentioned in Mongol
      history as <span class="smcap">Barguchin Tugrum</span> or <span class="smcap">Barguti</span>, and which Rashiduddin calls the
      northern limit of the inhabited earth. This commenced about Lake Baikal,
      where the name still survives in that of a river (<em>Barguzin</em>) falling into
      the Lake on the east side, and of a town on its banks (<em>Barguzinsk</em>).
      Indeed, according to Rashid himself, <span class="smcap">Bargu</span> was the name of one of the
      tribes occupying the plain; and a quotation from Father Hyacinth would seem
      to show that the country is still called <em>Barakhu</em>.</p>

    <p>[The Archimandrite Palladius (<cite>Elucidations</cite>, 16–17) writes:—“In the
      Mongol text of Chingis Khan’s biography, this country is called Barhu and
      Barhuchin; it is to be supposed, according to Colonel Yule’s identification
      of this name with the modern Barguzin, that this country was near Lake
      Baikal. The fact that Merkits were in Bargu is confirmed by the following
      statement in Chingis Khan’s biography: ‘When Chingis Khan defeated his
      enemies, the Merkits, they fled to Barhuchin <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>tokum.’ <em>Tokum</em> signifies
      ‘a hollow, a low place,’ according to the Chinese translation of the
      above-mentioned biography, made in 1381; thus Barhuchin tokum undoubtedly
      corresponds to M. Polo’s Plain of Bargu. As to M. Polo’s statement that the
      inhabitants of Bargu were Merkits, it cannot be accepted unconditionally.
      The Merkits were not indigenous to the country near Baikal, but belonged
      originally,—according to a division set forth in the Mongol text of the
      <em>Yuan ch’ao pi shi</em>,—to the category of tribes <em>living in yurts</em>, <i>i.e.</i>
      nomad tribes, or tribes of the desert. Meanwhile we find in the same
      biography of Chingis Khan, mention of a people called Barhun, which
      belonged to the category of tribes <em>living in the forests</em>; and we have
      therefore reason to suppose that the Barhuns were the aborigines of Barhu.
      After the time of Chingis Khan, this ethnographic name disappears from
      Chinese history; it appears again in the middle of the 16th century. The
      author of the <cite>Yyu</cite> (1543–1544), in enumerating the tribes inhabiting
      Mongolia and the adjacent countries, mentions the Barhu, as a strong tribe,
      able to supply up to several tens of thousands (?) of warriors, armed with
      steel swords; but the country inhabited by them is not indicated. The
      Mongols, it is added, call them Black Ta-tze (Khara Mongols, <i>i.e.</i> ‘Lower Mongols’).</p>

    <p>“At the close of the 17th century, the Barhus are found inhabiting the
      western slopes of the interior Hing’an, as well as between Lake Kulon and
      River Khalkha, and dependent on a prince of eastern Khalkhas, Doro beile.

    <p>“At the time of Galdan Khan’s invasion, a part of them fled to Siberia
      with the eastern Khalkhas, but afterwards they returned. [<em>Mung ku yew mu
      ki</em> and <em>Lung sha ki lio</em>.] After their rebellion in 1696, quelled by a
      Manchu General, they were included with other petty tribes (regarding which
      few researches have been made) in the category <em>butkha</em>, or hunters, and
      received a military organisation. They are divided into Old and New Barhu,
      according to the time when they were brought under Manchu rule. The Barhus
      belong to the Mongolian, not to the Tungusian race; they are sometimes
      considered even to have been in relationship with the Khalkhas. (<em>He lung
      kiang wai ki</em> and <em>Lung sha ki lio</em>.)</p>

    <p>“This is all the substantial information we possess on the Barhu. Is
      there an affinity to be found between the modern Barhus and the Barhuns
      of Chingis Khan’s biography?—and is it to be supposed, that in the course
      of time, they spread from Lake Baikal to the Hing’an range? Or is it more
      correct to consider them a branch of the Mongol race indigenous to the
      Hing’an Mountains, and which received the general archaic name of Bargu,
      which might have pointed out the physical character of the country they
      inhabited [<em>Kin Shi</em>], just as we find in history the Urianhai of Altai and
      the Urianhai of Western Manchuria? It is difficult to solve this question
      for want of historical data.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><em>Mescript</em>, or <em>Mecri</em>, as in G.&nbsp;T. The <em>Merkit</em>, a great tribe to the
      south-east of the Baikal, were also called <em>Mekrit</em>, and sometimes <em>Megrin</em>.
      The Mekrit are spoken of also by Carpini and Rubruquis. D’Avezac thinks
      that the <em>Kerait</em>, and not the <em>Merkit</em>, are intended by all three
      travellers. As regards Polo, I see no reason for this view. The name he
      uses is <em>Mekrit</em>, and the position which he assigns to them agrees fairly
      with that assigned on good authority to the Merkit or Mekrit. Only, as
      in other cases, where he is rehearsing hearsay information, it does not
      follow that the identification of the name involves the correctness of
      all the circumstances that he connects with that name. We saw in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXX1">ch. xxx.</a>
      that under <em>Pashai</em> he seemed to lump circumstances belonging to various
      parts of the region from Badakhshan to the Indus; so here under <em>Mekrit</em>
      he embraces characteristics belonging to tribes extending far beyond the
      Mekrit, and which in fact are appropriate to the Tunguses. Rashiduddin
      seems to describe the latter under the name of <em>Uriangkut</em> of the Woods, a
      people dwelling beyond the frontier of Barguchin, and in connection with
      whom he speaks of their Reindeer obscurely, as well as of their tents of
      birch bark, and their hunting on snow-shoes.</p>

    <p>The mention of the Reindeer by Polo in this passage is one of the
      interesting points which Pauthier’s text omits. Marsden objects to the
      statement that the stags <span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>are ridden upon, and from this motive mis-renders
      “<em>li qual’anche</em> cavalcano,” as, “which they make use of for the purpose
      of travelling.” Yet he might have found in Witsen that the Reindeer are
      <em>ridden</em> by various Siberian Tribes, but especially by the Tunguses. Erman
      is very full on the reindeer-riding of the latter people, having himself
      travelled far in that way in going to Okhotsk, and gives a very detailed
      description of the saddle, etc., employed. The reindeer of the Tunguses are
      stated by the same traveller to be much larger and finer animals than those
      of Lapland. They are also used for pack-carriage and draught. Old Richard
      Eden says that the “olde wryters” relate that “certayne Scythians doe ryde
      on Hartes.” I have not traced to what he refers, but if the statement be in
      any ancient author it is very remarkable. Some old editions of Olaus Magnus
      have curious cuts of Laplanders and others riding on reindeer, but I find
      nothing in the text appropriate. We hear from travellers of the Lapland
      deer being occasionally mounted, but only it would seem in sport, not as a
      practice. (<cite>Erdmann</cite>, 189, 191; <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, I. 103; <cite>D’Avezac</cite>, 534 <i>seqq.</i>;

    <p>The numerous lakes and marshes swarming with water-fowl are very
      characteristic of the country between Yakutsk and the Kolyma. It is evident
      that Marco had his information from an eye-witness, though the whole
      picture is compressed. Wrangell, speaking of Nijni Kolyma, says: “It is at
      the moulting season that the great bird-hunts take place. The sportsmen
      surround the nests, and slip their dogs, which drive the birds to the
      water, on which they are easily knocked over with a gun or arrow, or even
      with a stick.... This chase is divided into several periods. They begin
      with the ducks, which moult first; then come the geese; then the swans....
      In each case the people take care to choose the time when the birds have
      lost their feathers.” The whole calendar with the Yakuts and Russian
      settlers on the Kolyma is a succession of fishing and hunting seasons which
      the same author details. (I. 149, 150; 119–121.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVI13" href="#NoteAnchor_LVI13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      3.</a>—What little is said of the <em>Barguerlac</em> points to some bird of
      the genus <em>Pterocles</em>, or Sand Grouse (to which belong the so-called Rock
      Pigeons of India), or to the allied <i>Tetrao paradoxus</i> of Pallas, now
      known as <i>Syrrhaptes Pallasii</i>. Indeed, we find in Zenker’s Dictionary
      that <em>Boghurtláḳ</em> (or <em>Baghírtláḳ</em>, as it is in Pavet de Courteille’s) in
      Oriental Turkish is the <em>Kata</em>, <i>i.e.</i> I presume, the <i>Pterocles alchata</i> of
      Linnæus, or Large Pin-tailed Sand Grouse. Mr. Gould, to whom I referred
      the point, is clear that the <i>Syrrhaptes</i> is Marco’s bird, and I believe
      there can be no question of it.</p>

    <p>[Passing through Ch’ang-k’ou, Mr. Rockhill found the people praying for
      rain. “The people told me,” he says, in his <cite>Journey</cite> (p. 9), “that they knew
      long ago the year would be disastrous, for the sand grouse had been more
      numerous of late than for years, and the saying goes <em>Sha-ch’i kuo, mai
      lao-po</em>, ‘when the sand grouse fly by, wives will be for sale.’”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The chief difficulty in identification with the Syrrhaptes or any known
      bird, would be “the feet like a parrot’s.” The feet of the Syrrhaptes are
      not indeed like a parrot’s, though its awkward, slow, and waddling gait on
      the ground, may have suggested the comparison; and though it has very odd
      and anomalous feet, a circumstance which the Chinese indicate in another
      way by calling the bird (according to Huc) <em>Lung Kio</em>, or “Dragon-foot.”
      [Mr. Rockhill (<em>Journey</em>) writes in a note (p. 9): “I, for my part, never
      heard any other name than <em>sha-ch’i</em>, ‘sand-fowl,’ given them. This name is
      used, however, for a variety of birds, among others the partridge.”—H.&nbsp;C.]
      The hind-toe is absent, the toes are unseparated, recognisable only by the
      broad flat nails, and fitted below with a callous couch, whilst the whole
      foot is covered with short dense feathers like hair, and is more like a
      quadruped’s paw than a bird’s foot.</p>

    <p>The home of the Syrrhaptes is in the Altai, the Kirghiz Steppes, and the
      country round Lake Baikal, though it also visits the North of China in
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>great flights. “On plains of grass and sandy deserts,” says Gould (<cite>Birds
      of Great Britain</cite>, Part IV.), “at one season covered with snow, and at
      another sun-burnt and parched by drought, it finds a congenial home; in
      these inhospitable and little-known regions it breeds, and when necessity
      compels it to do so, wings its way ... over incredible distances to obtain
      water or food.” Huc says, speaking of the bird on the northern frontier of
      China: “They generally arrive in great flights from the north, especially
      when much snow has fallen, flying with astonishing rapidity, so that the
      movement of their wings produces a noise like hail.” It is said to be
      very delicate eating. The bird owes its place in Gould’s <cite>Birds of Great
      Britain</cite> to the fact—strongly illustrative of its being <em>moult volant</em>,
      as Polo says it is—that it appeared in England in 1859, and since then,
      at least up to 1863, continued to arrive annually in pairs or companies
      in nearly all parts of our island, from Penzance to Caithness. And Gould
      states that it was breeding in the Danish islands. A full account by Mr.
      A. Newton of this remarkable immigration is contained in the <cite>Ibis</cite> for
      April, 1864, and many details in <cite>Stevenson’s Birds of Norfolk</cite>, I. 376
      <i>seqq.</i> There are plates of <i>Syrrhaptes</i> in <cite>Radde’s Reisen im Süden von
      Ost-Sibirien</cite>, Bd. II.; in vol. v. of <cite>Temminck</cite>, Planches Coloriées, Pl.

      4.</a>—Gerfalcons (<i>Shonḳár</i>) were objects of high estimation in the
      Middle Ages, and were frequent presents to and from royal personages. Thus
      among the presents sent with an embassy from King James II. of Aragon to
      the Sultan of Egypt, in 1314, we find three white gerfalcons. They were
      sent in homage to Chinghiz and to Kúblái, by the Kirghiz, but I cannot
      identify the mountains where they or the Peregrines were found. The
      Peregrine falcon was in Europe sometimes termed <i>Faucon Tartare</i>. (See
      <cite>Ménage</cite> s.v. <cite>Sahin</cite>.) The Peregrine of Northern Japan, and probably
      therefore that of Siberia, is identical with that of Europe. Witsen speaks
      of an island in the Sea of Tartary, from which falcons were got, apparently
      referring to a Chinese map as his authority; but I know nothing more of it.

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_LVII1"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER LVII</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Kingdom of Erguiul, and Province of Sinju.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving Campichu, then, you travel five days across a tract in which
    many spirits are heard speaking in the night season; and at the end of
    those five marches, towards the east, you come to a kingdom called <span class="smcap">Erguiul</span>,
    belonging to the Great Kaan. It is one of the several kingdoms which
    make up the great Province of Tangut. The people consist of Nestorian
    Christians, Idolaters, and worshippers of Mahommet.<a id="NoteAnchor_LVII11" href="#Note_LVII11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>There are plenty of cities in this kingdom, but the capital is <span class="smcap">Erguiul</span>. You
    can travel in a south-easterly direction from this place into the province
    of Cathay. Should you follow that road to the south-east, you come to a
    city called <span class="smcap">Sinju</span>, belonging also to Tangut, and subject to the Great
    Kaan, which has under it many towns and villages.<a id="NoteAnchor_LVII12" href="#Note_LVII12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> The population
    is composed of Idolaters, and worshippers of Mahommet, but there are some
    Christians also. There are wild cattle in that country [almost] as big as
    elephants, splendid creatures, covered everywhere but on the back with
    shaggy hair a good four palms long. They are partly black, partly white,
    and really wonderfully fine creatures [and the hair or wool is extremely
    fine and white, finer and whiter than silk. Messer Marco brought some to
    Venice as a great curiosity, and so it was reckoned by those who saw it].
    There are also plenty of them tame, which have been caught young. [They
    also cross these with the common cow, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>and the cattle from this cross are
    wonderful beasts, and better for work than other animals.] These the people
    use commonly for burden and general work, and in the plough as well; and at
    the latter they will do full twice as much work as any other cattle, being
    such very strong beasts.<a id="NoteAnchor_LVII13" href="#Note_LVII13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>In this country too is found the best musk in the world; and I will tell
    you how ’tis produced. There exists in that region a kind of wild animal
    like a gazelle. It has feet and tail like the gazelle’s, and stag’s hair
    of a very coarse kind, but no horns. It has four tusks, two below and two
    above, about three inches long, and slender in form, one pair growing
    upwards, and the other downwards. It is a very pretty creature. The musk
    is found in this way. When the creature has been taken, they find at the
    navel between the flesh and the skin something like an impostume full of
    blood, which they cut out and remove with all the skin attached to it. And
    the blood inside this impostume is the musk that produces that powerful
    perfume. There is an immense number of these beasts in the country we are
    speaking of. [The flesh is very good to eat. Messer Marco brought the dried
    head and feet of one of these animals to Venice with him.<a id="NoteAnchor_LVII14" href="#Note_LVII14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a>]</p>

  <p>The people are traders and artizans, and also grow abundance of corn. The
    province has an extent of 26 days’ journey. Pheasants are found there
    twice as big as ours, indeed nearly as big as a peacock, and having tails
    of 7 to 10 palms in length; and besides them other pheasants in aspect
    like our own, and birds of many other kinds, and of beautiful variegated
    plumage.<a id="NoteAnchor_LVII15" href="#Note_LVII15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a> The people, who are Idolaters, are fat folks with little
    noses and black hair, and no beard, except a few hairs on the upper lip.
    The women too have very smooth <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>and white skins, and in every respect are
    pretty creatures. The men are very sensual, and marry many wives, which is
    not forbidden by their religion. No matter how base a woman’s descent may
    be, if she have beauty she may find a husband among the greatest men in the
    land, the man paying the girl’s father and mother a great sum of money,
    according to the bargain that may be made.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVII11" href="#NoteAnchor_LVII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—No approximation to the name of Erguiul in an appropriate position
      has yet been elicited from Chinese or other Oriental sources. We cannot
      go widely astray as to its position, five days east of Kanchau. Klaproth
      identifies it with Liangchau-fu; Pauthier with the neighbouring city of
      Yungchang, on the ground that the latter was, in the time of Kúblái, the
      head of one of the <em>Lús</em>, or Circles, of Kansuh or Tangut, which he has
      shown some reason for believing to be the “kingdoms” of Marco.</p>

    <p>It is probable, however, that the <em>town</em> called by Polo Erguiul lay north
      of both the cities named, and more in line with the position assigned below
      to <cite>Egrigaya</cite>. (See <a href="#Note_LVIII11">note 1, ch. lviii.</a>)</p>

    <p>I may notice that the structure of the name Ergui-ul or Ergiu-ul, has a
      look of analogy to that of <em>Tang-keu-ul</em>, named in the next note.</p>

    <p>[“Erguiul is Erichew of the Mongol text of the <cite>Yuen ch’ao pi shi</cite>,
      Si-liang in the Chinese history, the modern <em>Liang chow fu</em>. Klaproth, on
      the authority of Rashid-eddin, has already identified this name with that
      of Si-liang.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 18.) M. Bonin left Ning-h’ia at the end of
      July, 1899, and he crossed the desert to Liangchau in fifteen days from
      east to west; he is the first traveller who took this route: Prjevalsky
      went westward, passing by the residence of the Prince of Alashan, and
      Obrutchev followed the route south of Bonin’s.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVII12" href="#NoteAnchor_LVII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      2.</a>—No doubt Marsden is right in identifying this with <span class="smcap">Sining-Chau</span>,
      now Sining-fu, the Chinese city nearest to Tibet and the Kokonor frontier.
      Grueber and Dorville, who passed it on their way to Lhasa, in 1661, call
      it <i>urbs ingens</i>. Sining was visited also by Huc and Gabet, who are
      unsatisfactory, as usually on geographical matters. They also call it
      “an immense town,” but thinly peopled, its commerce having been in part
      transferred to Tang-keu-ul, a small town closer to the frontier.</p>

    <p>[Sining belonged to the country called Hwang chung; in 1198, under the Sung
      Dynasty, it was subjugated by the Chinese, and was named Si-ning chau; at
      the beginning of the Ming Dynasty (from 1368), it was named Si-ning wei,
      and since 1726 Si-ning fu. (Cf. Gueluy, <cite>Chine</cite>, p. 62.) From Liangchau,
      M. Bonin went to Sining through the Lao kou kau pass and the Ta-Tung ho.
      Obrutchev and Grum Grijmaïlo took the usual route from Kanchau to Sining.
      After the murder of Dutreuil de Rhins at Tung bu <em>m</em>do, his companion,
      Grenard, arrived at Sining, and left it on the 29th July, 1894. Dr. Sven
      Hedin gives in his book his own drawing of a gate of Sining-fu, where he
      arrived on the 25th November, 1896.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Sining is called by the Tibetans <em>Ziling</em> or Jiling, by the Mongols <em>Seling
      Khoto</em>. A shawl wool texture, apparently made in this quarter, is imported
      into Kashmir and Ladak, under the name of <em>S’ling</em>. I have supposed Sining
      to be also the <em>Zilm</em> of which Mr. Shaw heard at Yarkand, and am answerable
      for a note to that effect on p. 38 of his <cite>High Tartary</cite>. But Mr. Shaw,
      on his return to Europe, gave some rather strong reasons against this.
      (See <cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> XVI. 245; <cite>Kircher</cite>, pp. 64, 66; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span><cite>Della Penna</cite>, 27;
      <cite>Davies’s Report</cite>, App. p. ccxxix.; <cite>Vigne</cite>, II. 110, 129.) [At present
      Sining is called by the Tibetans Seling K’ar or Kuar, and by the Mongols,
      Seling K’utun, <em>K’ar</em> and <em>K’utun</em> meaning “fortified city.” (<cite>Rockhill,
      Land of the Lamas</cite>, 49, note.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Diary of a Journey</cite>, 65) writes: “There must be some Scotch
      blood in the Hsi-ningites, for I find they are very fond of oatmeal and of
      cracked wheat. The first is called <em>yen-mei ch’en</em>, and is eaten boiled
      with the water in which mutton has been cooked, or with neat’s-foot oil
      (<em>yang-t’i yu</em>). The cracked wheat (<em>mei-tzŭ fan</em>) is eaten prepared in the
      same way, and is a very good dish.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVII13" href="#NoteAnchor_LVII13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The <em>Dong</em>, or Wild Yak, has till late years only been known by
      vague rumour. It has always been famed in native reports for its great
      fierceness. The <cite>Haft Iḳlím</cite> says that “it kills with its horns, by its
      kicks, by treading under foot, and by tearing with its teeth,” whilst the
      Emperor Humáyún himself told Sidi ’Ali, the Turkish admiral, that when it
      had knocked a man down it skinned him from head to heels by licking him
      with its tongue! Dr. Campbell states, in the <cite>Journal of the As. Soc. of
      Bengal</cite>, that it was said to be four times the size of the domestic Yak.
      The horns are alleged to be sometimes three feet long, and of immense
      girth; they are handed round full of strong drink at the festivals of
      Tibetan grandees, as the Urus horns were in Germany, according to Cæsar.</p>

    <p>A note, with which I have been favoured by Dr. Campbell (long the respected
      Superintendent of British Sikkim) says: “Captain Smith, of the Bengal Army,
      who had travelled in Western Tibet, told me that he had shot many wild Yaks
      in the neighbourhood of the Mansarawar Lake, and that he measured a bull
      which was 18 hands high, <i>i.e.</i> 6 feet. All that he saw were <em>black</em> all
      over. He also spoke to the fierceness of the animal. He was once charged by
      a bull that he had wounded, and narrowly escaped being killed. Perhaps my
      statement (above referred to) in regard to the relative size of the Wild
      and Tame Yak, may require modification if applied to all the countries in
      which the Yak is found. At all events, the finest specimen of the tame Yak
      I ever saw, was not in Nepal, Sikkim, Tibet, or Bootan, but in the <cite>Jardin
      des Plantes</cite> at <em>Paris</em>; and that one, a male, was brought from Shanghai.
      The best drawing of a Yak I know is that in Turner’s <cite>Tibet</cite>.”</p>

    <p>[Lieutenant Samuel Turner gave a very good description of the Yak of
      Tartary, which he calls <em>Soora-Goy</em>, or the Bushy-tailed Bull of Tibet.
      (<cite>Asiat. Researches</cite>, No. XXIII, pp. 351–353, with a plate.) He says with
      regard to the colour: “There is a great variety of colours amongst them,
      but black or white are the most prevalent. It is not uncommon to see the
      long hair upon the ridge of the back, the tail, tuft upon the chest, and
      the legs below the knee white, when all the rest of the animal is jet
      black.” A good drawing of “an enormous” Yak is to be found on p. 183
      of Captain Wellby’s <cite>Unknown Tibet</cite>. (See also Captain Deasy’s work on
      <cite>Tibet</cite>, p. 363.) Prince Henri d’Orléans brought home a fine specimen,
      which he shot during his journey with Bonvalot; it is now exhibited in the
      galleries of the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle. Some Yaks were brought to
      Paris on the 1st April, 1854, and the celebrated artist, Mme. Rosa Bonheur,
      made sketches after them. (See <cite>Jour. Soc. Acclimatation</cite>, June, 1900,
      39–40.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Captain Prjevalsky, in his recent journey (1872–1873), shot twenty wild
      Yaks south of the Koko Nor. He specifies one as 11 feet in length exclusive
      of the tail, which was 3 feet more; the height 6 feet. He speaks of the Yak
      as less formidable than it looks, from apathy and stupidity, but very hard
      to kill; one having taken eighteen bullets before it succumbed.</p>

    <p>[Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, 151, note) writes: “The average load carried by
      a Yak is about 250 lbs. The wild Yak bull is an enormous animal, and the
      people of Turkestan and North Tibet credit him with extraordinary strength.
      Mirza Haidar, in the <cite>Tarikhi Rashidi</cite>, says of the wild Yak or <em>kutás</em>:
      ‘This is a very wild and ferocious beast. In whatever manner it attacks one
      it proves fatal. Whether it strikes with its horns, or kicks, or overthrows
      its victim. If it has no opportunity of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>doing any of these things, it
      tosses its enemy with its tongue twenty <em>gaz</em> into the air, and he is dead
      before reaching the ground. One male <em>kutás</em> is a load for twelve horses.
      One man cannot possibly raise a shoulder of the animal.’”—Captain Deasy
      (<cite>In Tibet</cite>, 363) says: “In a few places on lofty ground in Tibet we found
      Yaks in herds numbering from ten to thirty, and sometimes more. Most of the
      animals are black, brown specimens being very rare. Their roving herds move
      with great agility over the steep and stony ground, apparently enjoying the
      snow and frost and wind, which seldom fail.... Yaks are capable of offering
      formidable resistance to the sportsman....”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The tame Yaks are never, I imagine, “caught young,” as Marco says; it is
      a domesticated <em>breed</em>, though possibly, as with buffaloes in Bengal, the
      breed may occasionally be refreshed by a cross of wild blood. They are
      employed for riding, as beasts of burden, and in the plough. [Lieutenant
      S. Turner, <i>l.c.</i>, says, on the other hand: “They are never employed in
      agriculture, but are extremely useful as beasts of burthen.”—H.&nbsp;C.] In
      the higher parts of our Himalayan provinces, and in Tibet, the Yak itself
      is most in use; but in the less elevated tracts several breeds crossed
      with the common Indian cattle are more used. They have a variety of names
      according to their precise origin. The inferior Yaks used in the plough
      are ugly enough, and “have more the appearance of large shaggy bears than
      of oxen,” but the Yak used for riding, says Hoffmeister, “is an infinitely
      handsomer animal. It has a stately hump, a rich silky hanging tail nearly
      reaching the ground, twisted horns, a noble bearing, and an erect head.”
      Cunningham, too, says that the <em>Dso</em>, one of the mixed breeds, is “a very
      handsome animal, with long shaggy hair, generally black and white.” Many of
      the various tame breeds appear to have the tail and back white, and also
      the fringe under the body, but black and red are the prevailing colours.
      Some of the crossbred cows are excellent milkers, better than either parent stock.</p>

    <p>Notice in this passage the additional and interesting particulars given
      by Ramusio, <i>e.g.</i> the use of the mixed breeds. “Finer than silk,” is an
      exaggeration, or say an <em>hyberbole</em>, as is the following expression, “As
      big as elephants,” even with Ramusio’s apologetic <em>quasi</em>. Cæsar says the
      Hercynian Urus was <i lang="la">magnitudine paullo infra elephantos</i>.</p>

    <p>The tame Yak is used across the breadth of Mongolia. Rubruquis saw them at
      Karakorum, and describes them well. Mr. Ney Elias tells me he found Yaks
      common everywhere along his route in Mongolia, between the Tui river (long.
      <i>circa</i> 101°) and the upper valleys of the Kobdo near the Siberian frontier.
      At Uliasut’ai they were used occasionally by Chinese settlers for drawing
      carts, but he never saw them used for loads or for riding, as in Tibet. He
      has also seen Yaks in the neighbourhood of Kwei-hwa-ch’eng. (<cite>Tenduc</cite>, see
      <a href="#Note_LIX11">ch. lix. note 1.</a>) This may be taken as the eastern limit of the employment
      of the Yak; the western limit is in the highlands of Khokand.</p>

    <p>These animals had been noticed by Cosmas [who calls them <em>agriobous</em>] in
      the 6th century, and by Ælian in the 3rd. The latter speaks of them as
      black cattle with white tails, from which fly-flappers were made for Indian
      kings. And the great Kalidása thus sang of the Yak, according to a learned
      (if somewhat rugged) version ascribed to Dr. Mill. The poet personifies the
      Himálaya:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“For Him the large Yaks in his cold plains that bide</div>
          <div class="i1">Whisk here and there, playful, their tails’ bushy pride,</div>
          <div class="i1">And evermore flapping those fans of long hair</div>
          <div class="i1">Which borrowed moonbeams have made splendid and fair,</div>
          <div class="i1">Proclaim at each stroke (what our flapping men sing)</div>
          <div class="i1">His title of Honour, ‘The Dread Mountain King.’”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Who can forget Père Huc’s inimitable picture of the hairy Yaks of their
      caravan, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>after passing a river in the depth of winter, “walking with their
      legs wide apart, and bearing an enormous load of stalactites, which hung
      beneath their bellies quite to the ground. The monstrous beasts <em>looked
      exactly as if they were preserved in sugar-candy</em>.” Or that other, even
      more striking, of a great troop of wild Yaks, caught in the upper waters
      of the Kin-sha Kiang, as they swam, in the moment of congelation, and thus
      preserved throughout the winter, gigantic “flies in amber.”</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVII14" href="#NoteAnchor_LVII14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—Ramusio adds that the hunters seek the animal at New Moon, at which
      time the musk is secreted.</p>

    <p>The description is good except as to the <em>four</em> tusks, for the musk deer
      has canine teeth only in the upper jaw, slender and prominent as he
      describes them. The flesh of the animal is eaten by the Chinese, and in
      Siberia by both Tartars and Russians, but that of the males has a strong
      musk flavour.</p>

    <p>The “immense number” of these animals that existed in the Himalayan
      countries may be conceived from Tavernier’s statement, that on one visit
      to Patna, then the great Indian mart for this article, he purchased 7673
      pods of musk. These presumably came by way of Nepal; but musk pods of the
      highest class were also imported from Khotan <i>viâ</i> Yarkand and Leh, and the
      lowest price such a pod fetched at Yarkand was 250 tankas, or upwards
      of 4<i>l.</i> This import has long been extinct, and indeed the trade in the
      article, except towards China, has altogether greatly declined, probably
      (says Mr. Hodgson) because its repute as a medicine is becoming fast
      exploded. In Sicily it is still so used, but apparently only as a sort of
      decent medical <i lang="la">viaticum</i>, for when it is said “the Doctors have given him
      musk,” it is as much as to say that they have given up the patient.</p>

    <p>[“Here Marco Polo speaks of musk; musk and rhubarb (which he mentions
      before, Sukchur, <a href="#CHAPTER_XLIII1">ch. xliii.</a>) are the most renowned and valuable of the
      products of the province of Kansu, which comparatively produces very
      little; the industry in both these articles is at present in the hands of
      the Tanguts of that province [<cite>Su chow chi</cite>].” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 18.)</p>

    <p>Writing under date 15th February, 1892, from Lusar (coming from Sining),
      Mr. Rockhill says: “The musk trade here is increasing, Cantonese and
      Ssŭ-ch’uanese traders now come here to buy it, paying for good musk four
      times its weight in silver (<em>ssŭ huan</em>, as they say). The best test of
      its purity is an examination of the colour. The Tibetans adulterate it
      by mixing tsamba and blood with it. The best time to buy it is from the
      seventh to the ninth moon (latter part of August to middle of November).”
      Mr. Rockhill adds in a note: “Mongols call musk <em>owo</em>; Tibetans call it
      <em>latsé</em>. The best musk they say is ‘white musk,’ <em>tsahan owo</em> in Mongol,
      in Tibetan <em>latsé karpo</em>. I do not know whether white refers to the colour
      of the musk itself or to that of the hair on the skin covering the musk
      pouch.” (<cite>Diary of a Journey</cite>, p. 71.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Three species of the <em>Moschus</em> are found in the Mountains of Tibet, and <em>M.
      Chrysogaster</em>, which Mr. Hodgson calls “the loveliest,” and which chiefly
      supplies the highly-prized pod called <em>Kághazi</em>, or “Thin-as-paper,” is
      almost exclusively confined to the Chinese frontier. Like the Yak, the
      <em>Moschus</em> is mentioned by Cosmas (<i>circa</i> <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 545), and <em>musk</em> appears
      in a Greek prescription by Aëtius of Amida, a physician practising at
      Constantinople about the same date.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVII15" href="#NoteAnchor_LVII15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—The China pheasant answering best to the indications in the text,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>appears to be <em>Reeves’s Pheasant</em>. Mr. Gould has identified this bird with
      Marco’s in his magnificent <cite>Birds of Asia</cite>, and has been kind enough to
      show me a specimen which, with the body, measured 6 feet 8 inches. The tail
      feathers alone, however, are said to reach to 6 and 7 feet, so that Marco’s
      ten palms was scarcely an exaggeration. These tail-feathers are often seen
      on the Chinese stage in the cap of the hero of the drama, and also decorate
      the hats of certain civil functionaries.</p>

    <p><em>Size</em> is the point in which the bird fails to meet Marco’s description. In
      that respect the latter would rather apply to the <i>Crossoptilon auritum</i>,
      which is nearly as big as a turkey, or to the glorious <i>Múnál (Lophophorus
      impeyanus)</i>, but then that has no length of tail. The latter seems to be
      the bird described by Ælian: “Magnificent cocks which have the crest
      variegated and ornate like a crown of flowers, and the tail feathers not
      curved like a cock’s, but broad and carried in a train like a peacock’s;
      the feathers are partly golden, and partly azure or emerald-coloured.”

      recently been found by Captain Prjevalsky in Alashan, the Egrigaia (as I
      believe) of next chapter, and one also by Abbé Armand David at the Koko Nor.</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Kingdom of Egrigaia.</div>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_LVIII11" href="#NoteAnchor_LVIII11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Chinghiz invaded Tangut in all five times, viz. in 1205, 1207, 1209
      (or according to Erdmann, 1210–1211), 1218, and 1226–1227, on which last
      expedition he died.</p>

    <p><i>A</i>. In the third invasion, according to D’Ohsson’s Chinese guide (Father
      Hyacinth), he took the town of <em>Uiraca</em>, and the fortress of Imen, and laid
      siege to the capital, then called Chung-sing or Chung-hing, now Ning-hsia.</p>

    <p>Rashid, in a short notice of this campaign, calls the first city <em>Erica</em>,
      <em>Erlaca</em>, or, as Erdmann has it, <em>Artacki</em>. In De Mailla it is <em>Ulahai</em>.</p>

    <p><i>B</i>. On the last invasion (1226), D’Ohsson’s Chinese authority says that
      Chinghiz took Kanchau and Suhchau, Cholo and Khola in the province of
      Liangcheu, and then proceeded to the Yellow River, and invested Lingchau,
      south of Ning-hsia.</p>

    <p>Erdmann, following his reading of Rashiduddin, says Chinghiz took the
      cities of Tangut, called <em>Arucki</em>, <em>Kachu</em>, <em>Sichu</em>, and <em>Kamichu</em>, and
      besieged Deresgai (D’Ohsson, <em>Derssekai</em>), whilst Shidergu, the King of
      Tangut, betook himself to his capital <em>Artackin</em>.</p>

    <p>D’Ohsson, also professing to follow Rashid, calls this “his capital
      <em>Irghai</em>, which the Mongols call <em>Ircaya</em>.” Klaproth, illustrating Polo,
      reads “Eyircai, which the Mongols call <em>Eyircayá</em>.”</p>

    <p>Pétis de la Croix, relating the same campaign and professing to follow
      Fadlallah, <i>i.e.</i> Rashiduddin, says the king “retired to his fortress of
      <em>Arbaca</em>.”</p>

    <p><i>C</i>. Sanang Setzen several times mentions a city called <em>Irghai</em>,
      <em>apparently</em> in Tangut; but all we can gather as to his position is that it
      seems to have lain east of Kanchau.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span></p>

    <p>We perceive that the <em>Arbaca</em> of P. de la Croix, the <em>Eyircai</em> of Klaproth,
      the <em>Uiraca</em> of D’Ohsson, the <em>Artacki</em> or <em>Artackin</em> of Erdmann, are all
      various readings or forms of the same name, and are the same with the
      Chinese form <em>Ulahai</em> of De Mailla, and most probably the place is the
      <em>Egrigaia</em> of Polo.</p>

    <p>We see also that Erdmann mentions another place <em>Aruki</em> (<span lang="ar">ارقى</span>?) in
      connection with Kanchau and Suhchau. This is, I suspect, the <em>Erguiul</em> of
      Polo, and perhaps the Irghai of Sanang Setzen.</p>

    <p>Rashiduddin seems wrong in calling Ircayá the capital of the king, a
      circumstance which leads Klaproth to identify it with Ning-hsia. Pauthier,
      identifying Ulahai with Egrigaya, shows that the former was one of the
      circles of Tangut, but <em>not</em> that of Ning-hsia. Its position, he says, is
      uncertain. Klaproth, however, inserts it in his map of Asia, in the era
      of Kúblái (<cite>Tabl. Hist.</cite> pl. 22), as <em>Ulakhai</em> to the north of Ning-hsia,
      near the great bend eastward of the Hwang-Ho. Though it may have extended
      in this direction, it is probable, from the name referred to in next note,
      that Egrigaia or Ulahai is represented by the modern principality of
      <span class="smcap">Alashan</span>, visited by Prjevalsky in 1871 and 1872.</p>

    <p>[New travels and researches enable me to say that there can be no doubt
      that <em>Egrigaia = Ning-hsia</em>. Palladius (<i>l.c.</i> 18) says: “<em>Egrigaia</em> is
      Erigaia of the Mongol text. Klaproth was correct in his supposition that
      it is modern Ning-h’ia. Even now the Eleuths of Alashan call Ning-h’ia,
      <em>Yargai</em>. In M. Polo’s time this department was famous for the cultivation
      of the Safflower (<i>carthamus tinctorius</i>). [<cite>Siu t’ung kien</cite>, <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1292.]”
      Mr. Rockhill (cf. his <cite>Diary of a Journey</cite>) writes to me that Ning-hsia is
      still called <em>Irge Khotun</em> by Mongols at the present day. M. Bonin (<cite>J.
      As.</cite>, 1900. I. 585) mentions the same fact.</p>

    <p>Palladius (19) adds: “<em>Erigaia</em> is not to be confounded with <em>Urahai</em>,
      often mentioned in the history of Chingis Khan’s wars with the Tangut
      kingdom. Urahai was a fortress in a pass of the same name in the Alashan
      Mountains. Chingis Khan spent five months there (an. 1208), during which he
      invaded and plundered the country in the neighbourhood. [<em>Si hia shu shi.</em>]
      The Alashan Mountains form a semicircle 500 <i>li</i> in extent, and have over
      forty narrow passes leading to the department of Ning-hia; the broadest
      and most practicable of these is now called Ch’i-mu-K’ow; it is not more
      than 80 feet broad. [<cite>Ning hia fu chi.</cite>] It may be that the Urahai fortress
      existed near this pass.”</p>

    <p>“From Liang-chow fu, M. Polo follows a special route, leaving the modern
      postal route on his right; the road he took has, since the time of the
      Emperor K’ang-hi, been called the courier’s route.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 18.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVIII12" href="#NoteAnchor_LVIII12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—<em>Calachan</em>, the chief town of Egrigaia, is mentioned, according to
      Klaproth, by Rashiduddin, among the cities of Tangut, as <span class="smcap">Kalaján</span>. The name
      and approximate position suggest, as just noticed, identity with Alashan,
      the modern capital of which, called by Prjevalsky Dyn-yuan-yin, stands some
      distance west of the Hwang-Ho, in about lat. 39°. Polo gives no data for
      the interval between this and his next stage.</p>

    <p>[The <em>Dyn-yuan-yin</em> of Prjevalsky is the camp of <em>Ting-yuan-yng</em> or Fu-ma-fu
      of M. Bonin, the residence of the Si-wang (western prince), of Alashan,
      an abbreviation of Alade-shan (<em>shan</em>, mountain in Chinese), Alade = Eleuth
      or Œlöt; the sister of this prince married a son of Prince Tuan, the chief
      of the <em>Boxers</em>. (<cite>La Géographie</cite>, 1901. I. 118.) Palladius (<i>l.c.</i> 19) says:
      “Under the name of Calachan, Polo probably means the summer residence of
      the Tangut kings, which was 60 <i>li</i> from Ning-hia, at the foot of the
      Alashan Mountains. It was built by the famous Tangut king Yuen-hao, on a
      large scale, in the shape of a castle, in which were high terraces and
      magnificent buildings. Traces of these buildings are visible to this day.
      There are often found coloured tiles and iron nails 1 foot, and even 2 feet
      long. The last Tangut kings made this place their permanent residence, and
      led there an indolent and sensual life. The Chinese name of this residence
      was Ho-lan shan <em>Li-Kung</em>. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>There is sufficient reason to suppose that this
      very residence is named (under the year 1226) in the Mongol text <em>Alashai
      nuntuh</em>; and in the chronicles of the Tangut Kingdom, <em>Halahachar</em>,
      otherwise <em>Halachar</em>, apparently in the Tangut language. Thus M. Polo’s
      Calachan can be identified with the Halachar of the <em>Si hia shu shi</em>, and
      can be taken to designate the Alashan residence of the Tangut kings.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LVIII13" href="#NoteAnchor_LVIII13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—Among the Buraets and Chinese at Kiakhta snow-white camels, without
      albino character, are often seen, and probably in other parts of Mongolia.
      (See <cite>Erdmann</cite>, II. 261.) Philostratus tells us that the King of Taxila
      furnished white camels to Apollonius. I doubt if the present King of
      Taxila, whom Anglo-Indians call the Commissioner of Ráwal Pindi, could do
      the like.</p>

    <p><em>Cammellotti</em> appear to have been fine woollen textures, by no means what
      are now called camlets, nor were they necessarily of camel’s wool, for
      those of Angora goat’s wool were much valued. M. Douet d’Arcq calls it “a
      fine stuff of wool approaching to our Cashmere, and sometimes of silk.”
      Indeed, as Mr. Marsh points out, the word is Arabic, and has nothing to
      do with <em>Camel</em> in its origin; though it evidently came to be associated
      therewith. <em>Khamlat</em> is defined in F. Johnson’s Dict.: “Camelot, silk
      and camel’s hair; also all silk or velvet, especially pily and plushy,”
      and <em>Khaml</em> is “pile or plush.” <em>Camelin</em> was a different and inferior
      material. There was till recently a considerable import of different kinds
      of woollen goods from this part of China into Ladakh, Kashmir, and the
      northern Panjáb. [Leaving Ning-hsia, Mr. Rockhill writes (<cite>Diary</cite>, 1892,
      44): “We passed on the road a cart with Jardine and Matheson’s flag, coming
      probably from Chung-Wei Hsien, where camel’s wool is sold in considerable
      quantities to foreigners. This trade has fallen off very much in the last
      three or four years on account of the Chinese middlemen rolling the wool
      in the dirt so as to add to its weight, and practising other tricks on
      buyers.”—H.&nbsp;C.] Among the names of these were <em>Sling</em>, <em>Shirum</em>, <em>Gurun</em>,
      and <em>Khoza</em>, said to be the names of the towns in China where the goods
      were made. We have supposed <em>Sling</em> to be Sining (<a href="#Note_LVII12">note 2, ch. lvii.</a>), but
      I can make nothing of the others. Cunningham also mentions “camlets of
      camel’s hair,” under the name of <em>Suḳlát</em>, among imports from the same
      quarter. The term <em>Suḳlát</em> is, however, applied in the <em>Panjáb</em> trade
      returns to <em>broadcloth</em>. Does not this point to the real nature of the
      <em>siclatoun</em> of the Middle Ages? It is, indeed, often spoken of as used for
      banners, which implies that it was not a <em>heavy</em> woollen:</p>

    <p class="noindent">But it was also a material for ladies’ robes, for quilts, leggings,
      housings, pavilions. Franc. Michel does not decide what it was, only that
      it was generally <em>red</em> and wrought with gold. Dozy renders it “silk stuff
      brocaded with gold”; but this seems conjectural. Dr. Rock says it was a
      thin glossy silken stuff, often with a woof of gold thread, and seems to
      derive it from the Arabic ṣaḳl, “polishing” (a sword), which is improbable.
      Perhaps the name is connected with <em>Ṣiḳiliyat</em>, “Sicily.”</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Province of Tenduc, and the Descendants of Prester John.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Tenduc</span> is a province which lies towards the east, and contains numerous
    towns and villages; among which is the chief city, also called <span class="smcap">Tenduc</span>. The
    king of the province is of the lineage of Prester John, George by name, and
    he holds the land under the Great Kaan; not that he holds anything like the
    whole of what Prester John possessed.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIX11" href="#Note_LIX11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> It is a custom, I may tell
    you, that these kings of the lineage of Prester John always obtain to wife
    either daughters of the Great Kaan or other princesses of his family.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIX12" href="#Note_LIX12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>In this province is found the stone from which Azure is made. It
    is obtained from a kind of vein in the earth, and is of very fine
    quality.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIX13" href="#Note_LIX13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> There is also a great manufacture of fine camlets of
    different colours from camel’s hair. The people get their living by their
    cattle and tillage, as well as by trade and handicraft.</p>

  <p>The rule of the province is in the hands of the Christians, as I have told
    you; but there are also plenty of Idolaters and worshippers of Mahommet.
    And there is also here a class of people called <em>Argons</em>, which is as
    much as to say in French <em>Guasmul</em>, or, in other words, sprung from two
    different races: to wit, of the race of the Idolaters of Tenduc and of
    that of the worshippers of Mahommet. They are handsomer men than the
    other natives of the country, and having more ability, they come to have
    authority; and they are also capital merchants.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIX14" href="#Note_LIX14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>You must know that it was in this same capital city <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>of Tenduc that Prester
    John had the seat of his government when he ruled over the Tartars, and his
    heirs still abide there; for, as I have told you, this King George is of
    his line, in fact, he is the sixth in descent from Prester John.</p>

  <p>Here also is what <em>we</em> call the country of <span class="smcap">Gog</span> and <span class="smcap">Magog</span>; <em>they</em>, however,
    call it <span class="smcap">Ung</span> and <span class="smcap">Mungul</span>, after the names of two races of people that existed
    in that Province before the migration of the Tartars. <em>Ung</em> was the title
    of the people of the country, and <em>Mungul</em> a name sometimes applied to the
    Tartars.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIX15" href="#Note_LIX15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>And when you have ridden seven days eastward through this province you get
    near the provinces of Cathay. You find throughout those seven days’ journey
    plenty of towns and villages, the inhabitants of which are Mahommetans, but
    with a mixture also of Idolaters and Nestorian Christians. They get their
    living by trade and manufactures; weaving those fine cloths of gold which
    are called <em>Nasich</em> and <em>Naques</em>, besides silk stuffs of many other kinds.
    For just as we have cloths of wool in our country, manufactured in a great
    variety of kinds, so in those regions they have stuffs of silk and gold in
    like variety.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIX16" href="#Note_LIX16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <p>All this region is subject to the Great Kaan. There is a city you come to
    called <span class="smcap">Sindachu</span>, where they carry on a great many crafts such as provide
    for the equipment of the Emperor’s troops. In a mountain of the province
    there is a very good silver mine, from which much silver is got: the place
    is called <span class="smcap">Ydifu</span>. The country is well stocked with game, both beast and
    bird.<a id="NoteAnchor_LIX17" href="#Note_LIX17" class="fnanchor">{7}</a></p>

  <p>Now we will quit that province and go three days’ journey forward.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_LIX11" href="#NoteAnchor_LIX11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Marco’s own errors led commentators much astray about Tanduc or
      Tenduc, till Klaproth put the matter in its true light.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span></p>

    <p>Our traveller says that Tenduc had been the seat of Aung Khan’s
      sovereignty; he has already said that it had been the scene of his final
      defeat, and he tells us that it was still the residence of his descendants
      in their reduced state. To the last piece of information he can speak as a
      witness, and he is corroborated by other evidence; but the second statement
      we have seen to be almost certainly erroneous; about the first we cannot
      speak positively.</p>

    <p>Klaproth pointed out the true position of Tenduc in the vicinity of the
      great northern bend of the Hwang-Ho, quoting Chinese authorities to show
      that <em>Thianté</em> or <em>Thianté-Kiun</em> was the name of a district or group
      of towns to the north of that bend, a name which he supposes to be the
      original of Polo’s <em>Tenduc</em>. The general position entirely agrees with
      Marco’s indications; it lies on his way eastward from Tangut towards
      Chagannor, and Shangtu (see ch. <a href="#CHAPTER_LX1">lx.</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LXI1">lxi.</a>), whilst in a later passage (Bk.
      II. ch. lxiv.), he speaks of the Caramoran or Hwang-Ho in its lower course,
      as “coming from the lands of Prester John.”</p>

    <p>M. Pauthier finds severe fault with Klaproth’s identification of the <em>name</em>
      Tenduc with the Thianté of the Chinese, belonging to a city which had
      been destroyed 300 years before, whilst he himself will have that name to
      be a corruption of <em>Tathung</em>. The latter is still the name of a city and
      Fu of northern Shansi, but in Mongol time its circle of administration
      extended beyond the Chinese wall, and embraced territory on the left of
      the Hwang-Ho, being in fact the first <em>Lu</em>, or circle, entered on leaving
      Tangut, and therefore, Pauthier urges, the “Kingdom of Tanduc” of our text.</p>

    <p>I find it hard to believe that Marco could get no nearer <span class="smcap">Tathung</span> than in
      the form of <em>Tanduc</em> or <em>Tenduc</em>. The origin of the last may have been some
      Mongol name, not recovered. But it is at least conceivable that a name
      based on the old <em>Thianté-Kiun</em> might have been retained among the Tartars,
      from whom, and not from the Chinese, Polo took his nomenclature. Thianté
      had been, according to Pauthier’s own quotations, the <em>military post of
      Tathung</em>; Klaproth cites a Chinese author of the Mongol era, who describes
      the Hwang-Ho as passing through <em>the territory of the ancient Chinese
      city of Thianté</em>; and Pauthier’s own quotation from the Modern Imperial
      Geography seems to imply that a place in that territory was recently known
      as Fung-chau-<em>Thianté-Kiun</em>.</p>

    <p>In the absence of preciser indications, it is reasonable to suppose
      that the Plain of Tenduc, with its numerous towns and villages, was the
      extensive and well-cultivated plain which stretches from the Hwang-Ho, past
      the city of Kuku-Khotan, or “Blue Town.” This tract abounds in the remains
      of cities attributed to the Mongol era. And it is not improbable that the
      city of Tenduc was Kuku-Khotan itself, now called by the Chinese Kwei-hwa
      Ch’eng, but which was known to them in the Middle Ages as <em>Tsing-chau</em>,
      and to which we find the Kin Emperor of Northern China sending an envoy in
      1210 to demand tribute from Chinghiz. The city is still an important mart
      and a centre of Lamaitic Buddhism, being the residence of a <em>Khutukhtu</em>, or
      personage combining the characters of cardinal and voluntarily re-incarnate
      saint, as well as the site of five great convents and fifteen smaller
      ones. Gerbillon notes that Kuku Khotan had been a place of great trade and
      population during the Mongol Dynasty.</p>

    <p>[The following evidence shows, I think, that we must look for the city of
      Tenduc to <em>Tou Ch’eng</em> or <em>Toto Ch’eng</em>, called <em>Togto</em> or <em>Tokto</em> by the
      Mongols. Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Diary</cite>, 18) passed through this place, and 5 <i>li</i>
      south of it, reached on the Yellow River, Ho-k’ou (in Chinese) or Dugus or
      Dugei (in Mongol). Gerbillon speaks of Toto in his sixth voyage in Tartary.
      (<cite>Du Halde</cite>, IV. 345.) Mr. Rockhill adds that he cannot but think that
      Yule overlooked the existence of Togto when he identified Kwei-hwa Ch’eng
      with Tenduc. Tou Ch’eng is two days’ march west of Kwei-hwa Ch’eng, “On
      the loess hill behind this place are the ruins of a large camp, Orch’eng,
      in all likelihood the site of the old town” (<i>l.c.</i> 18). M. Bonin (<cite>J. As.</cite>
      XV. 1900, 589) shares Mr. Rockhill’s opinion. From Kwei-hwa Ch’eng, M.
      Bonin went by the valley of the Hei Shui River to the Hwang Ho; at the
      junction of the two rivers stands the village of Ho-k’au (Ho-k’ou) south
      of the small town To Ch’eng, surmounted <span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>by the ruins of the old square
      Mongol stronghold of Tokto, the walls of which are still in a good state of
      preservation.—(<cite>La Géographie</cite>, I. 1901, p. 116.)</p>

    <p>On the other hand, it is but fair to state that Palladius (21) says: “The
      name of Tenduc obviously corresponds to T’ien-te Kiun, a military post,
      the position of which Chinese geographers identify correctly with that
      of the modern Kuku-hoton (<em>Ta tsing y t’ung chi</em>, ch. on the Tumots of
      Kuku-hoton). The T’ien-te Kiun post existed under this name during the
      K’itan (Liao) and Kin Dynasties up to Khubilai’s time (1267); when under
      the name of Fung-chow it was left only a district town in the department of
      Ta-t’ung fu. The Kin kept in T’ien-te Kiun a military chief, <em>Chao-t’ao-shi</em>,
      whose duty it was to keep an eye on the neighbouring tribes, and to
      use, if needed, military force against them. The T’ien-te Kiun district
      was hardly greater in extent than the modern aïmak of Tumot, into which
      Kuku-hoton was included since the 16th century, <i>i.e.</i> 370 <i>li</i> from north
      to south, and 400 <i>li</i> from east to west; during the Kin it had a settled
      population, numbering 22,600 families.”</p>

    <p>In a footnote, Palladius refers to the geographical parts of the <em>Liao
      shi, Kin shi</em>, and <em>Yuen shi</em>, and adds: “M. Polo’s commentators are wrong
      in suspecting an anachronism in his statement, or trying to find Tenduc
      elsewhere.”</p>

    <p>We find in the <cite>North-China Herald</cite> (29th April, 1887, p. 474) the
      following note from the <cite>Chinese Times</cite>: “There are records that the
      position of this city [Kwei-hwa Ch’eng] was known to the builder of the
      Great Wall. From very remote times, it appears to have been a settlement
      of nomadic tribes. During the last 1000 years it has been alternately
      possessed by the Mongols and Chinese. About <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1573, Emperor Wan-Li
      reclaimed it, enclosed a space within walls, and called it Kwei-hwa Ch’êng.”</p>

    <p>Potanin left Peking on the 13th May, 1884, for Kuku-khoto (or
      Kwei-hwa-Ch’eng), passing over the triple chain of mountains dividing the
      Plain of Peking from that on which Kuku-khoto is situate. The southernmost
      of these three ridges bears the Chinese name of Wu-tai-shan, “the mountain
      of five sacrificial altars,” after the group of five peaks, the highest of
      which is 10,000 feet above the sea, a height not exceeded by any mountain
      in Northern China. At its southern foot lies a valley remarkable for its
      Buddhist monasteries and shrines, one of which, “Shing-tung-tze,” is
      entirely made of brass, whence its name.</p>

    <p>“Kuku-Khoto is the depôt for the Mongolian trade with China. It contains
      two hundred tea-shops, five theatres, fifteen temples, and six Mongol
      monasteries. Among its sights are the Buddhist convent of Utassa, with its
      five pinnacles and bas-reliefs, the convent of Fing-sung-si, and a temple
      containing a statue erected in honour of the Chinese general, Pai-jin-jung,
      who avenged an insult offered to the Emperor of China.” (<cite>Proc. R. G.
      S.</cite> IX. 1887, p. 233.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>A passage in Rashiduddin does seem to intimate that the Kerait, the tribe
      of Aung Khan, <i>alias</i> Prester John, did occupy territory close to the
      borders of Cathay or Northern China; but neither from Chinese nor from
      other Oriental sources has any illustration yet been produced of the
      existence of Aung Khan’s descendants as rulers in this territory under the
      Mongol emperors. There is, however, very positive evidence to that effect
      supplied by other European travellers, to whom the fables prevalent in
      the West had made the supposed traces of Prester John a subject of strong
      interest.</p>

    <p>Thus John of Monte Corvino, afterwards Archbishop of Cambaluc or Peking,
      in his letter of January, 1305, from that city, speaks of Polo’s King
      George in these terms: “A certain king of this part of the world, by name
      George, belonging to the sect of the Nestorian Christians, and of the
      illustrious lineage of that great king who was called Prester John of
      India, in the first year of my arrival here [<i>circa</i> 1295–1296] attached
      himself to me, and, after he had been converted by me to the verity of the
      Catholic faith, took the Lesser Orders, and when I celebrated mass used
      to attend me wearing his royal robes. Certain others of the Nestorians on
      this account accused him of apostacy, but he brought over a great part
      of his people with him to the true Catholic faith, and built a church
      of royal magnificence in honour of our God, of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>Holy Trinity, and of
      our Lord, the Pope, giving it the name of <em>the Roman Church</em>. This King
      George, six years ago, departed to the Lord, a true Christian, leaving
      as his heir a son scarcely out of the cradle, and who is now nine years
      old. And after King George’s death, his brothers, perfidious followers of
      the errors of Nestorius, perverted again all those whom he had brought
      over to the Church, and carried them back to their original schismatical
      creed. And being all alone, and not able to leave His Majesty the Cham, I
      could not go to visit the church above-mentioned, which is twenty days’
      journey distant.... I had been in treaty with the late King George, if
      he had lived, to translate the whole Latin ritual, that it might be sung
      throughout the extent of his territory; and whilst he was alive I used to
      celebrate mass in his church according to the Latin rite.” The distance
      mentioned, twenty days’ journey from Peking, suits quite well with the
      position assigned to Tenduc, and no doubt the Roman Church was in the city
      to which Polo gives that name.</p>

    <p>Friar Odoric, travelling from Peking towards Shensi, about 1326–1327, also
      visits the country of Prester John, and gives to its chief city the name
      of <em>Tozan</em>, in which perhaps we may trace <em>Tathung</em>. He speaks as if the
      family still existed in authority.</p>

    <p>King George appears again in Marco’s own book (Bk. IV. ch. ii.) as one
      of Kúblái’s generals against Kaidu, in a battle fought near Karakorúm.
      (<cite>Journ. As.</cite> IX. 299 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, I. 123; <cite>Huc’s Tartary</cite>, etc.
      I. 55 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Koeppen</cite>, II. 381; <cite>Erdmann’s Temudschin</cite>; <cite>Gerbillon</cite> in
      <cite>Astley</cite>, IV. 670; <cite>Cathay</cite>, pp. 146 and 199 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LIX12" href="#NoteAnchor_LIX12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—Such a compact is related to have existed reciprocally between the
      family of Chinghiz and that of the chief of the Ḳunguráts; but I have not
      found it alleged of the Kerait family except by Friar Odoric. We find,
      however, many <em>princesses</em> of this family married into that of Chinghiz.
      Thus three nieces of Aung Khan became wives respectively of Chinghiz
      himself and of his sons Juji and Tului; she who was the wife of the latter,
      Serḳuḳteni Bigi, being the mother of Mangú, Hulaku, and Kúblái. Duḳuz
      Khatun, the Christian wife of Hulaku, was a grand-daughter of Aung Khan.</p>

    <p>The name <em>George</em>, of Prester John’s representative, may have been actually
      Jirjis, Yurji, or some such Oriental form of Georgius. But it is possible
      that the title was really <em>Gurgán</em>, “Son-in-Law,” a title of honour
      conferred on those who married into the imperial blood, and that this
      title may have led to the statements of Marco and Odoric about the nuptial
      privileges of the family. Gurgán in this sense was one of the titles borne
      by Timur.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>[The following note by the Archimandrite Palladius (<cite>Eluc.</cite> 21–23) throws a
      great light on the relations between the families of Chinghiz Khan and of
      Prester John.</p>

    <p>“T’ien-te Kiun was bounded on the north by the <em>Yn-shan</em> Mountains, in
      and beyond which was settled the Sha-t’o Tu-K’iu tribe, <i>i.e.</i> Tu-K’iu of
      the sandy desert. The K’itans, when they conquered the northern borders
      of China, brought also under their rule the dispersed family of these Tu-K’iu.
      With the accession of the Kin, a Wang Ku [Ongot] family made its
      appearance as the ruling family of those <span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>tribes; it issued from those
      Sha- t’o Tu-K’iu, who once reigned in the north of China as the How T’ang
      Dynasty (923–936 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>). It split into two branches, the Wang-Ku of the Yn-shan,
      and the Wang-Ku of the Lin-t’ao (west of Kan-su). The Kin removed the
      latter branch to Liao-tung (in Manchuria). The Yn-shan Wang-Ku guarded the
      northern borders of China belonging to the Kin, and watched their herds.
      When the Kin, as a protection against the inroads of the tribes of the
      desert, erected a rampart, or new wall, from the boundary of the Tángut
      Kingdom down to Manchuria, they intrusted the defence of the principal
      places of the Yn-shan portion of the wall to the Wang-Ku, and transferred
      there also the Liao-tung Wang-Ku. At the time Chingiz Khan became powerful,
      the chief of the Wang-Ku of the Yn-shan was Alahush; and at the head of
      the Liao-tung Wang-Ku stood <em>Pa-sao-ma-ie-li</em>. Alahush proved a traitor
      to the Kin, and passed over to Chinghiz Khan; for this he was murdered by
      the malcontents of his family, perhaps by Pa-sao-ma-ie-li, who remained
      true to the Kin. Later on, Chingiz Khan married one of his daughters to
      the son of Alahush, by name Po-yao-ho, who, however, had no children by
      her. He had three sons by a concubine, the eldest of whom, Kiun-pu-hwa,
      was married to Kuyuk Khan’s daughter. Kiun-pu-hwa’s son, Ko-li-ki-sze,
      had two wives, both of imperial blood. During a campaign against Haidu, he
      was made prisoner in 1298, and murdered. His title and dignities passed
      over in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1310 to his son <em>Chuan</em>. Nothing is known of Alahush’s later
      descendants; they probably became entirely Chinese, like their relatives of
      the Liao-tung branch.</p>

    <p>“The Wang-Ku princes were thus <i lang="fr">de jure</i> the sons-in-law of the Mongol
      Khans, and they had, moreover, the hereditary title of Kao-t’ang princes
      (Kao-t’ang wang); it is very possible that they had their residence in
      ancient T’ien-te Kiun (although no mention is made of it in history), just
      as at present the Tumot princes reside in Kuku-hoton.</p>

    <p>“The consonance of the names of Wang-Khan and Wang-Ku (Ung-Khan and Ongu)
      led to the confusion regarding the tribes and persons, which at Marco
      Polo’s time seems to have been general among the Europeans in China;
      Marco Polo and Johannes de Monte Corvino transfer the title of Prester
      John from Wang-Khan, already perished at that time, to the distinguished
      family of Wang-Ku. Their Georgius is undoubtedly Ko-li-ki-sze, Alahush’s
      great-grandson. That his name is a Christian one is confirmed by other
      testimonies; thus in the Asu (Azes) regiment of the Khan’s guards was
      Ko-li-ki-sze, <i>alias</i> Kow-r-ki (†1311), and his son Ti-mi-ti-r. There is
      no doubt that one of them was Georgius, and the other Demetrius. Further,
      in the description of <em>Chin-Kiang</em> in the time of the Yuen, mention is made
      of Ko-li-ki-sze Ye-li-ko-wen, <i>i.e.</i> Ko-li-ki-sze, the Christian, and of his
      son Lu-ho (Luke).</p>

    <p>“Ko-li-ki-sze of Wang-ku is much praised in history for his valour and his
      love for Confucian doctrine; he had in consequence of a special favour
      of the Khan two Mongol princesses for wives at the same time (which is
      rather difficult to conciliate with his being a Christian). The time of
      his death is correctly indicated in a letter of Joannes de M. Corvino of
      the year 1305: <i lang="la">ante sex annos migravit ad Dominum</i>. He left a young son
      <em>Chu-an</em>, who probably is the Joannes of the letter of Ioannes (Giovani)
      de M. Corvino, so called <i lang="la">propter nomen meum</i>, says the missionary. In
      another Wang-ku branch, Si-li-ki-sze reminds one also of the Christian name

    <p><a id="Note_LIX14" href="#NoteAnchor_LIX14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—This is a highly interesting passage, but difficult, from being
      corrupt in the G. Text, and over-curt in Pauthier’s MSS. In the former
      it runs as follows: <span lang="fr">“<em>Hil hi a une jenerasion de jens que sunt appellés</em>
      Argon, <em>qe vaut à dire en françois</em> Guasmul, <em>ce est à dire qu’il sunt
      né del deus generasions de la lengnée des celz</em> Argon Tenduc et des celz
      reduc et des celz que aorent Maomet. <em>Il sunt biaus homes plus <span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_290">290</span>que le autre
      dou païs et plus sajes et plus mercaant</em>.”</span> Pauthier’s text runs thus:
      <span lang="fr">“<em>Il ont une generation de gens, ces Crestiens qui ont la Seigneurie, qui
      s’appellent</em> Argon, <em>qui vaut a dire</em> Gasmul; <em>et sont plus beaux hommes
      que les autres mescreans et plus sages. Et pour ce ont il la seigneurie et
      sont bons marchans.</em>”</span> And Ramusio: <span lang="fr">“<em>Vi è anche una sorte di gente che si
      chiamano</em> Argon, <em>per che sono nati di due generazioni</em>, cioè da quella
      di Tenduc che adorano gl’idoli, e da quella che osservano la legge di
      Macometto. <em>E questi sono i piu belli uomini che si trovino in quel paese e
      più savi, e più accorti nella mercanzia.</em>”</span></p>

    <p>In the first quotation the definition of the <em>Argon</em> as sprung <em>de la
      lengnée, etc.</em>, is not intelligible as it stands, but seems to be a
      corruption of the same definition that has been rendered by Ramusio, viz.
      that the Argon were half-castes between the race of the Tenduc Buddhists
      and that of the Mahomedan settlers. These two texts do not assert that
      the Argon were Christians. Pauthier’s text at first sight seems to assert
      this, and to identify them with the Christian rulers of the province. But
      I doubt if it means more than that the Christian rulers <em>have under them</em>
      a people called Argon, etc. The passage has been read with a bias, owing
      to an erroneous interpretation of the word <em>Argon</em> in the teeth of Polo’s
      explanation of it.</p>

    <p>Klaproth, I believe, first suggested that <em>Argon</em> represents the term
      <em>Arkhaiún</em>, which is found repeatedly applied to Oriental Christians, or
      their clergy, in the histories of the Mongol era.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> No quite satisfactory
      explanation has been given of the origin of that term. It is barely
      possible that it may be connected with that which Polo uses here; but he
      tells us as plainly as possible that he means by the term, not a Christian,
      but a <em>half-breed</em>.</p>

    <p>And in this sense the word is still extant in Tibet, probably also in
      Eastern Turkestan, precisely in Marco’s form, <span class="smcap">Argon</span>. It is applied in
      Ladak, as General Cunningham tells us, specifically to the mixt race
      produced by the marriages of Kashmirian immigrants with Bōt (Tibetan)
      women. And it was apparently to an analogous cross between Caucasians
      and Turanians that the term was applied in Tenduc. Moorcroft also speaks
      of this class in Ladak, calling them <em>Argands</em>. Mr. Shaw styles them “a
      set of ruffians called <em>Argoons</em>, half-bred between Toorkistan fathers
      and Ladak mothers.... They possess all the evil qualities of both races,
      without any of their virtues.” And the author of the Dabistan, speaking
      of the Tibetan Lamas, says: “Their king, if his mother be not of royal
      blood, is by them called <em>Arghún</em>, and not considered their true king.”
      [See <a href="#Page_291">p. 291</a>, my reference to <cite>Wellby’s Tibet</cite>.—H.&nbsp;C.] Cunningham says the
      word is probably Turki, <span lang="ar">ارغون</span>, <em>Arghún</em>, “Fair,” “not <em>white</em>,” as he
      writes to me, “but <em>ruddy</em> or <em>pink</em>, and therefore ‘fair.’ <em>Arghún</em> is
      both Turki and Mogholi, and is applied to all fair children, both male and
      female, as <em>Arghun Beg, Arghuna Khatun</em>,” etc.<a id="FNanchor_448"
      href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> We find an <em>Arghún</em> tribe
      named in Timur’s Institutes, which probably derived its descent from such
      half-breeds. And though the Arghún Dynasty of Kandahar and Sind claimed
      their descent and name from Arghún Khan of Persia, this may have had no
      other foundation.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>

    <p>There are some curious analogies between these Argons of whom Marco speaks
      and those Mahomedans of Northern China and Chinese Turkestan lately
      revolted against Chinese authority, who are called <em>Tungăni</em>, or as the
      Russians write it <em>Dungen</em>, a word signifying, according to Professor
      Vámbéry, in Turki, “a convert.”<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These Tungani are said by one account
      to trace their origin to a large body of Uighúrs, who were transferred <em>to
      the vicinity of the Great Wall</em> during the rule of the Thang Dynasty (7th
      to 10th century). Another tradition derives their origin from Samarkand.
      And it is remarkable that Rashiduddin speaks of a town to the west or
      north-west of Peking, “most of the inhabitants of which are natives of
      Samarkand, and have planted a number of gardens in the Samarkand style.”<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
      The former tradition goes on to say that marriages were encouraged between
      the Western settlers and the Chinese women. In after days these people
      followed the example of their kindred in becoming Mahomedans, but they
      still retained the practice of marrying Chinese wives, though bringing up
      their children in Islam. The Tungani are stated to be known in Central
      Asia for their commercial integrity; and they were generally selected by
      the Chinese for police functionaries. They are passionate and ready to use
      the knife; but are distinguished from both Manchus and Chinese by their
      strength of body and intelligent countenances. Their special feature is
      their predilection for mercantile speculations.</p>

    <p>Looking to the many common features of the two accounts—the origin as a
      half-breed between Mahomedans of Western extraction and Northern Chinese,
      the position in the vicinity of the Great Wall, the superior physique,
      intelligence, and special capacity for trade, it seems highly probable that
      the Tungani of our day are the descendants of Marco’s Argons. Otherwise we
      may at least point to these analogies as a notable instance of like results
      produced by like circumstances on the same scene; in fact, of history
      repeating itself. (See <cite>The Dungens</cite>, by <cite>Mr. H. K. Heins</cite>, in the <cite>Russian
      Military Journal</cite> for August, 1866, and <cite>Western China</cite>, in the <cite>Ed.
      Review</cite> for April, 1868;<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 261.)</p>

    <p>[Palladius (pp. 23–24) says that “it is impossible to admit that Polo
      had meant to designate by this name the Christians, who were called by
      the Mongols <em>Erkeun</em> [<cite>Ye li ke un</cite>]. He was well acquainted with the
      Christians in China, and of course could not ignore the name under which
      they were generally known to such a degree as to see in it a designation of
      a cross-race of Mahommetans and heathens.” From the <cite>Yuen ch’ao pi shi</cite> and
      the <cite>Yuen shi</cite>, Palladius gives some examples which refer to Mahommedans.</p>

    <p>Professor Devéria (<cite>Notes d’Épig.</cite> 49) says that the word <span lang="el">Ἄρχων</span>
      was used by the Mongol Government as a designation for the members of the
      Christian clergy at large; the word is used between 1252 and 1315 to speak
      of <em>Christian</em> priests by the historians of the Yuen Dynasty; it is not
      used before nor is it to be found in the Si-ngan-fu inscription (<i>l.c.</i> 82).
      Mr. E. H. Parker (<cite>China Review</cite>, xxiv. p. 157) supplies a few omissions
      in Devéria’s paper; we note among others: “Ninth moon of 1329. Buddhist
      services ordered to be held by the Uighúr priests, and by the Christians
      [<em>Ye li ke un</em>].”</p>

    <p>Captain Wellby writes (<cite>Unknown Tibet</cite>, p. 32): “We impressed into our
      service six other muleteers, four of them being Argoons, who are really
      half-castes, arising <span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>from the merchants of Turkestan making short marriages
      with the Ladakhi women.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Our author gives the odd word <em>Guasmul</em> as the French equivalent of Argon.
      M. Pauthier has first, of Polo’s editors, given the true explanation from
      Ducange. The word appears to have been in use in the Levant among the
      Franks as a name for the half-breeds sprung from their own unions with
      Greek women. It occurs three times in the history of George Pachymeres.
      Thus he says (<cite>Mich. Pal.</cite> III. 9), that the Emperor Michael “depended
      upon the <em>Gasmuls</em>, or mixt breeds (<span lang="el">συμμíκτοι</span>), which is the
      sense of this word of the Italian tongue, for these were born of Greeks
      and Italians, and sent them to man his ships; for the race in question
      inherited at once the military wariness and quick wit of the Greeks, and
      the dash and pertinacity of the Latins.” Again (IV. 26) he speaks of these
      “Gasmuls, whom a Greek would call <span lang="el">διγενεῖς</span>, men sprung from Greek
      mothers and Italian fathers.” Nicephorus Gregoras also relates how Michael
      Palaeologus, to oppose the projects of Baldwin for the recovery of his
      fortunes, manned 60 galleys, chiefly with the tribe of Gasmuls (<span lang="el">γένος τοῦ Γασμουλικοῦ</span>),
      to whom he assigns the same characteristics as
      Pachymeres. (IV. v. 5, also VI. iii. 3, and XIV. x. 11.) One MS. of Nicetas
      Choniates also, in his annals of Manuel Comnenus (see Paris ed. p. 425),
      speaks of “the light troops whom we call <em>Basmuls</em>.” Thus it would seem
      that, as in the analogous case of the <em>Turcopuli</em>, sprung from Turk fathers
      and Greek mothers, their name had come to be applied technically to a
      class of troops. According to Buchon, the laws of the Venetians in Candia
      mention, as different races in that island, the <em>Vasmulo</em>, Latino, Blaco,
      and Griego.</p>

    <p>Ducange, in one of his notes on Joinville, says: “During the time that the
      French possessed Constantinople, they gave the name of <em>Gas-moules</em> to
      those who were born of French fathers and Greek mothers; or more probably
      <em>Gaste-moules</em>, by way of derision, as if such children by those irregular
      marriages ... had in some sort debased the wombs of their mothers!” I have
      little doubt (<i lang="la">pace tanti viri</i>) that the word is in a Gallicized form
      the same with the surviving Italian <i lang="it">Guazzabúglio</i>, a hotch-potch, or
      mish-mash. In Davanzati’s <cite>Tacitus</cite>, the words “Colluviem <i lang="la">illam nationum</i>”
      (<cite>Annal.</cite> II. 55) are rendered “<em>quello</em> guazzabuglio <em>di nazioni</em>,” in
      which case we come very close to the meaning assigned to <em>Guasmul</em>. The
      Italians are somewhat behind in matters of etymology, and I can get no
      light from them on the history of this word. (See <cite>Buchon</cite>, <cite>Chroniques
      Etrangères</cite>, p. xv.; <cite>Ducange</cite>, <cite>Gloss. Graecitatis</cite>, and his note on
      <cite>Joinville</cite>, in <cite>Bohn’s Chron. of the Crusades</cite>, 466.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LIX15" href="#NoteAnchor_LIX15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—It has often been cast in Marco’s teeth that he makes no mention of
      the Great Wall of China, and that is true; whilst the apologies made for
      the omission have always seemed to me unsatisfactory. [I find in Sir G.
      Staunton’s account of Macartney’s Embassy (II. p. 185) this most amusing
      explanation of the reason why Marco Polo did not mention the wall: “A copy
      of Marco Polo’s route to China, taken from the Doge’s Library at Venice,
      is sufficient to decide this question. By this route it appears that, in
      fact, that traveller did not pass through Tartary to Pekin, but that after
      having followed the usual track of the caravans, as far to the eastward
      from Europe as Samarcand and Cashgar, he bent his course to the south-east
      across the River Ganges to Bengal (!), and, keeping to the southward of
      the Thibet mountains, reached the Chinese province of Shensee, and through
      the adjoining province of Shansee to the capital, without interfering with
      the line of the Great Wall.”—H.&nbsp;C.] We shall see presently that the Great
      Wall is spoken of by Marco’s contemporaries Rashiduddin and Abulfeda. Yet
      I think, if we read “between the lines,” we shall see reason to believe
      that the Wall <em>was</em> in Polo’s mind at this point of the dictation, whatever
      may have been his motive for withholding distincter notice of it.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I
      cannot conceive why he should say: “Here is what we call the country of
      Gog and Magog,” except as intimating “Here we are <em>beside the</em> <span class="smcap">Great Wall</span>
      known as the Rampart of Gog and Magog,” and being there he tries to find a
      reason why those names should have been applied to it. Why they were really
      applied to it we have already seen. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Note_IV23">ch. iv. note 3.</a>) Abulfeda
      says: “The Ocean turns northward along the east of China, and then expands
      in the same direction till it passes China, and comes opposite to the
      Rampart of Yájúj and Májúj;” whilst the same geographer’s definition of the
      boundaries of China exhibits that country as bounded on the west by the
      Indo-Chinese wildernesses; on the south, by the seas; on the east, by the
      Eastern Ocean; on the north, by the <em>land of Yájúj and Májúj</em>, and other
      countries unknown. Ibn Batuta, with less accurate geography in his head
      than Abulfeda, maugre his travels, asks about the Rampart of Gog and Magog
      (<em>Sadd Yájúj wa Májúj</em>) when he is at Sin Kalán, <i>i.e.</i> Canton, and, as might
      be expected, gets little satisfaction.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

    <p>Apart from this interesting point Marsden seems to be right in the general
      bearing of his explanation of the passage, and I conceive that the two
      classes of people whom Marco tries to identify with Gog and Magog do
      substantially represent the two genera or species, <span class="smcap">Turks</span> and <span class="smcap">Mongols</span>, or,
      according to another nomenclature used by Rashiduddin, the <em>White</em> and
      <em>Black</em> Tartars. To the latter class belonged Chinghiz and his <span class="smcap">Mongols</span>
      proper, with a number of other tribes detailed by Rashiduddin, and these
      I take to be in a general way the <span class="smcap">Mungul</span> of our text. The <em>Ung</em>, on the
      other hand, are the <span class="smcap">Ung</span>-<em>ḳut</em>, the latter form being presumably only the
      Mongol plural of <span class="smcap">Ung</span>. The Ung-ḳut were a Turk tribe who were vassals of the
      Kin Emperors of Cathay, and were intrusted with the defence of the Wall
      of China, or an important portion of it, which was called by the Mongols
      <em>Ungu</em>, a name which some connect with that of the tribe. [See note <a href="#Page_288">pp.
      288–9</a>.] Erdmann indeed asserts that the wall by which the Ung-ḳut dwelt
      was not the Great Wall, but some other. There are traces of other great
      ramparts in the steppes north of the present wall. But Erdmann’s arguments
      seem to me weak in the extreme.</p>

    <p>[Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 112) writes: “The earliest mention I have
      found of the name <em>Mongol</em> in Oriental works occurs in the Chinese annals
      of the After T’ang period (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 923–934), where it occurs in the form
      <em>Meng-ku</em>. In the annals of the Liao Dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 916–1125) it is found
      under the form <em>Meng-ku-li</em>. The first occurrence of the name in the <cite>Tung
      chien kang mu</cite> is, however, in the 6th year Shao-hsing of Kao-tsung of
      the Sung (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1136). It is just possible that we may trace the word back
      a little earlier than the After T’ang period, and that the <em>Meng-wa</em> (or
      <em>ngo</em>, as this character may have been pronounced at the time), a branch of
      the Shih-wei, a Tungusic or Kitan people living around Lake Keule, to the
      east of the Baikal, and along the Kerulun, which empties into it, during
      the 7th and subsequent centuries, and referred to in the <cite>T’ang shu</cite> (Bk.
      219), is the same as the later Meng-ku. Though I have been unable to find,
      as stated by Howorth (<cite>History</cite>, i. pt. I. 28), that the name <em>Meng-ku</em>
      occurs in the T’ang shu, his conclusion that the northern Shih-wei of that
      time constituted the Mongol nation proper is very likely correct.... I.
      J. Schmidt (<cite>Sanang Setzen</cite>, 380) derives the name <em>Mongol</em> from <em>mong</em>,
      meaning ‘brave, daring, bold,’ while Rashid-eddin says it means ‘simple,
      weak’ (<cite>d’Ohsson</cite>, i. 22). The Chinese characters used to transcribe the
      name mean ‘dull, stupid,’ and ‘old, ancient,’ but they are used purely
      phonetically.... The Mongols of the present day are commonly called by the
      Chinese <em>Ta-tzŭ</em>, but this name is resented by the Mongols as opprobrious,
      though it is but an abbreviated form of the name <em>Ta-ta-tzŭ</em>, in which,
      according to Rubruck, they once gloried.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Vincent of Beauvais has got from some of his authorities a conception
      of the distinction of the Tartars into two races, to which, however, he
      assigns no names: “<i lang="la">Sunt autem duo genera Tartarorum, diversa quidem
      habentia idiomata, sed unicam legem ac ritum, sicut Franci et Theutonici</i>.”
      But the result of <em>his</em> effort to find a realisation of Gog and Magog is
      that he makes <em>Guyuk Kaan</em> into Gog, and <em>Mangu Kaan</em> into Magog. Even
      the intelligent Friar Ricold says of the Tartars: “They say themselves
      that they are descended from Gog and Magog: and on this account they are
      called <em>Mogoli</em>, as if from a corruption of <em>Magogoli</em>.” (<cite>Abulfeda</cite> in
      <cite>Büsching</cite>, IV. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>140, 274–275; <cite>I. B.</cite> IV. 274; <cite>Golden Horde</cite>, 34, 68;

    <p><a id="Note_LIX16" href="#NoteAnchor_LIX16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—The towns and villages were probably those immediately north of the
      Great Wall, between 112° and 115° East longitude, of which many remains
      exist, ascribed to the time of the Yuen or Mongol Dynasty. This tract,
      between the Great Wall and the volcanic plateau of Mongolia, is extensively
      colonised by Chinese, and has resumed the flourishing aspect that Polo
      describes. It is known now as the <i>Ku-wei</i>, or extramural region.</p>

    <p>[After Kalgan, Captain Younghusband, on the 12th April, 1886, “passed
      through the [outer] Great Wall ... entering what Marco Polo calls the land
      of Gog and Magog. For the next two days I passed through a hilly country
      inhabited by Chinese, though it really belongs to Mongolia; but on the 14th
      I emerged on to the real steppes, which are the characteristic features of
      Mongolia Proper.” (<cite>Proc. R. G. S.</cite> X., 1888, p. 490.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Of the cloths called <em>nakh</em> and <em>nasij</em> we have spoken before (<i>supra</i> <a href="#Note_VI14">ch.
      vi. note 4</a>). These stuffs, or some such as these, were, I believe, what the
      mediæval writers called <em>Tartary cloth</em>, not because they were made in
      Tartary, but because they were brought from China and its borders through
      the Tartar dominions; as we find that for like reason they were sometimes
      called stuffs of <em>Russia</em>. Dante alludes to the supposed skill of Turks and
      Tartars in weaving gorgeous stuffs, and Boccaccio, commenting thereon, says
      that Tartarian cloths are so skilfully woven that no painter with his brush
      could equal them. Maundevile often speaks of cloths of Tartary (<i>e.g.</i> pp.
      175, 247). So also Chaucer:</p>

      taken by Chinghiz. It is said to have been a summer residence of the later
      Mongol Emperors, and fine parks full of grand trees remain on the western
      side. It is still a large town and the capital of a <em>Fu</em>, about 25 miles
      south of the Gate on the Great Wall at Chang Kia Kau, which the Mongols
      and Russians call Kalgan. There is still a manufacture of felt and woollen
      articles here.</p>

      buckskins.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><em>Ydifu</em> has not been identified. But Baron Richthofen saw old mines
      north-east of Kalgan, which used to yield argentiferous galena; and
      Pumpelly heard of silver-mines near Yuchau, in the same department.</p>

    <p>[In the <em>Yuen-shi</em> it is “stated that there were gold and silver mines in
      the districts of Siuen-te-chow and Yuchow, as well as in the Kiming shan
      Mountains. These mines were worked by the Government itself up to 1323,
      when they were transferred to private enterprise. Marco Polo’s <em>Ydifu</em> is
      probably a copyist’s error, and stands instead of Yuchow.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>,

      <a id="Footnote_446" href="#FNanchor_446" class="label">[1]</a> Mr. Ney Elias favours me with a curious but tantalising
      communication on this subject: “An old man called on me at Kwei-hwa
      Ch’eng (Tenduc), who said he was neither Chinaman, Mongol, nor
      Mahomedan, and lived on ground a short distance to the north of
      the city, especially allotted to his ancestors by the Emperor, and
      where there now exist several families of the same origin. He then
      mentioned the connection of his family with that of the Emperor,
      but in what way I am not clear, and said that he ought to be, or
      had been, a prince. Other people coming in, he was interrupted and
      went away.... He was not with me more than ten minutes, and the
      incident is a specimen of the difficulty in obtaining interesting
      information, except by mere chance.... The idea that struck me was,
      that he was perhaps a descendant of King George of Tenduc; for
      I had your M. P. before me, and had been inquiring as much as I
      dared about subjects it suggested.... At Kwei-hwa Ch’eng I was very
      closely spied, and my servant was frequently told to warn me against
      asking too many questions.”

      <p>I should mention that Oppert, in his very interesting monograph,
        <cite>Der Presbyter Johannes</cite>, refuses to recognise the Kerait chief at
        all in that character, and supposes Polo’s King George to be the
        representative of a prince of the Liao (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_205">p. 205</a>), who, as we
        learn from De Mailla’s History, after the defeat of the Kin, in
        which he had assisted Chinghiz, settled in Liaotung, and received
        from the conqueror the title of King of the Liao. This seems to me
        geographically and otherwise quite inadmissible.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_447" href="#FNanchor_447" class="label">[2]</a> The term <em>Arkaiun</em>, or <em>Arkaun</em>, in this sense, occurs in
      the Armenian History of Stephen Orpelian, quoted by St. Martin.
      The author of the <cite>Tárikh Jahán Kushai</cite>, cited by D’Ohsson, says
      that Christians were called by the Mongols <em>Arkáún</em>. When Hulaku
      invested Baghdad we are told that he sent a letter to the Judges,
      Shaikhs, Doctors and <em>Arkauns</em>, promising to spare such as should
      act peaceably. And in the subsequent sack we hear that no houses
      were spared except those of a few <em>Arkauns</em> and foreigners. In
      Rashiduddin’s account of the Council of State at Peking, we are
      told that the four <em>Fanchan</em>, or Ministers of the Second Class,
      were taken from the four nations of Tájiks, Cathayans, Uighúrs, and
      <em>Arkaun</em>. Sabadin <em>Arkaun</em> was the name of one of the Envoys sent
      by Arghun Khan of Persia to the Pope in 1288. Traces of the name
      appear also in Chinese documents of the Mongol era, as denoting
      <em>some</em> religious body. Some of these have been quoted by Mr. Wylie;
      but I have seen no notice taken of a very curious extract given
      by Visdelou. This states that Kúblái in 1289 established a Board
      of nineteen chief officers to have surveillance of the affairs of
      the Religion of the Cross, of the <em>Marha</em>, the <em>Siliepan</em>, and
      the <em>Yelikhawen</em>. This Board was raised to a higher rank in 1315:
      and at that time 72 minor courts presiding over the religion of
      the <em>Yelikhawen</em> existed under its supervision. Here we evidently
      have the word <em>Arkhaiun</em> in a Chinese form; and we may hazard
      the suggestion that <em>Marha</em>, <em>Siliepan</em> and <em>Yelikhawen</em> meant
      respectively the Armenian, Syrian, or Jacobite, and Nestorian
      Churches. (<cite>St. Martin, Mém.</cite> II. 133, 143, 279; <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, II.

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Kaan’s Palace of Chagannor.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> the end of those three days you find a city called <span class="smcap">Chagan Nor</span> [which
    is as much as to say White Pool], at which there is a great Palace of the
    Grand Kaan’s;<a id="NoteAnchor_LX11" href="#Note_LX11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> and he likes much to reside there on account of the
    Lakes and Rivers in the neighbourhood, which are the haunt of swans<a id="NoteAnchor_LX12" href="#Note_LX12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    and of a great variety of other birds. The adjoining plains too abound with
    cranes, partridges, pheasants, and other game birds, so that the Emperor
    takes all the more delight in staying there, in order to go a-hawking with
    his gerfalcons and other falcons, a sport of which he is very fond.<a id="NoteAnchor_LX13" href="#Note_LX13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>There are five different kinds of cranes found in those tracts, as I shall
    tell you. First, there is one which is very big, and all over as black as
    a crow; the second kind again is all white, and is the biggest of all;
    its wings are really beautiful, for they are adorned with round eyes like
    those of a peacock, but of a resplendent golden colour, whilst the head is
    red and black on a white ground. The third kind is the same as ours. The
    fourth is a small kind, having at the ears beautiful long pendent feathers
    of red and black. The fifth kind is grey all over and of great size, with a
    handsome head, red and black.<a id="NoteAnchor_LX14" href="#Note_LX14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>Near this city there is a valley in which the Emperor has had several
    little houses erected in which he keeps in mew a huge number of <em>cators</em>,
    which are what we call the Great Partridge. You would be astonished to see
    what a quantity there are, with men to take charge of them. So whenever the
    Kaan visits the place he is furnished with as many as he wants.<a id="NoteAnchor_LX15" href="#Note_LX15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

      dictionary-makers. It occurs in the old Italian version of <cite>Brunetto
      Latini’s Tresor</cite>, Bk. V. ch. xxv., as <em>cecino</em>; and for other examples, see
      <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 125.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LX13" href="#NoteAnchor_LX13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The city called by Polo <span class="smcap">Chagan-nor</span> (meaning in Mongol, as he
      says, “White Lake”) is the <em>Chaghan Balghasun</em> mentioned by Timkowski
      as an old city of the Mongol era, the ruined rampart of which he passed
      about 30 miles north of the Great Wall at Kalgan, and some 55 miles from
      Siuen-hwa, adjoining the Imperial pastures. It stands near a lake still
      called Chaghan-Nor, and is called by the Chinese Pe-ching-tzu, or White
      City, a translation of Chaghan Balghasun. Dr. Bushell says of one of the
      lakes (Ichi-Nor), a few miles east of Chaghan-Nor: “We ... found the water
      black with waterfowl, which rose in dense flocks, and filled the air with
      discordant noises. <em>Swans</em>, geese, and ducks predominated, and <em>three
      different species of cranes</em> were distinguished.”</p>

    <p>The town appears as <em>Tchahan Toloho</em> in D’Anville. It is also, I imagine,
      the <em>Arulun Tsaghan Balghasun</em> which S. Setzen says Kúblái built about the
      same time with Shangtu and another city “on the shady side of the Altai,”
      by which here he seems to mean the Khingan range adjoining the Great Wall.
      (<cite>Timk.</cite> II. 374, 378–379; <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> vol. xliii.; <cite>S. Setz.</cite> 115.) I
      see Ritter has made the same identification of Chaghan-Nor (II. 141).</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LX14" href="#NoteAnchor_LX14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—The following are the best results I can arrive at in the
      identification of these five cranes.</p>

    <p>1. Radde mentions as a rare crane in South Siberia <i>Grus monachus</i>, called
      by the Buraits <em>Kará Togorü</em>, or “Black Crane.” Atkinson also speaks of “a
      beautiful black variety of crane,” probably the same. The <i>Grus monachus</i>
      is not, however, jet black, but brownish rather. (<cite>Radde, Reisen</cite>, Bd. II.
      p. 318; <cite>Atkinson. Or. and W. Sib.</cite> 548.)</p>

    <p>2. <i>Grus leucogeranus</i> (?) whose chief habitat is Siberia, but which
      sometimes comes as far south as the Punjab. It is the largest of the genus,
      snowy white, with red face and beak; the ten largest quills are black, but
      this barely shows as a narrow black line when the wings are closed. The
      resplendent golden eyes on the wings remain unaccounted for; no naturalist
      whom I have consulted has any knowledge of a crane or crane-like bird with
      such decorations. When ’tis discovered, let it be the <i>Grus Poli</i>!</p>

    <p>3. <i>Grus cinerea</i>.</p>

    <p>4. The colour of the pendants varies in the texts. Pauthier’s and the G.
      Text have <em>red and black</em>; the Lat. S.&nbsp;G. <em>black</em> only, the Crusca <em>black
      and white</em>, Ramusio <em>feathers red and blue</em> (not pendants). The <em>red and
      black</em> may have slipt in from the preceding description. I incline to
      believe it to be the Demoiselle, <i>Anthropoides Virgo</i>, which is frequently
      seen as far north as Lake Baikal. It has a tuft of pure <em>white</em> from the
      eye, and a beautiful black pendent ruff or collar; the general plumage
      purplish-grey.</p>

    <p>5. Certainly the Indian <em>Sáras</em> (vulgo Cyrus), or <i>Grus antigone</i>, which
      answers in colours and grows to 52 inches high.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LX15" href="#NoteAnchor_LX15" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—<em>Cator</em> occurs only in the G. Text and the Crusca, in the latter
      with the interpolated explanation “<em>cioè contornici</em>” (<i>i.e.</i> quails),
      whilst the S.&nbsp;G. Latin has <i>coturnices</i> only. I suspect this impression
      has assisted to corrupt the text, and that it was originally written or
      dictated <em>ciacor</em> or <em>çacor</em>, viz. <em>chakór</em>, a term applied in the East
      to more than one kind of “Great Partridge.” Its most common application
      in India is to the Himalayan red-legged partridge, much resembling on a
      somewhat larger scale the bird so called in Europe. It is the “Francolin”
      of Moorcroft’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>Travels, and the <i>Caccabis Chukor</i> of Gray. According to
      Cunningham the name is applied in Ladak to the bird sometimes called the
      Snow-pheasant, Jerdan’s Snow-cock, <i>Tetraogallus himalayensis</i> of Gray. And
      it must be the latter which Moorcroft speaks of as “the gigantic Chukor,
      much larger than the common partridge, found in large coveys on the edge
      of the snow; ... one plucked and drawn weighed 5 lbs.”; described by Vigne
      as “a partridge as large as a hen-turkey”; the original perhaps of that
      partridge “larger than a vulture” which formed one of the presents from
      an Indian King to Augustus Caesar. [With reference to the large Tibetan
      partridge found in the Nan-shan Mountains in the meridian of Sha-chau by
      Prjevalsky, M. E. D. Morgan in a note (<cite>P. R. Geog. S.</cite> ix. 1887, p. 219),
      writes: “<i>Megaloperdrix thibetanus</i>. Its general name in Asia is <em>ullar</em>,
      a word of Kirghiz or Turkish origin; the Mongols call it <em>hailik</em>, and the
      Tibetans <em>kung-mo</em>. There are two other varieties of this bird found in the
      Himalaya and Altai Mountains, but the habits of life and call-note of all
      three are the same.”] From the extensive diffusion of the term, which seems
      to be common to India, Tibet, and Persia (for the latter, see <cite>Abbott</cite>
      in <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXV. 41), it is likely enough to be of Mongol origin,
      not improbably <em>Tsokhor</em>, “dappled or pied.” (<cite>Kovalevsky</cite>, No. 2196, and
      <cite>Strahlenberg’s</cite> Vocabulary; see also <cite>Ladak</cite>, 205; <cite>Moorcr.</cite> I. 313, 432;
      <cite>Jerdan’s Birds of India</cite>, III. 549, 572; <cite>Dunlop, Hunting in Himalaya</cite>,
      178; <cite>J. A. S. B.</cite> VI. 774.)</p>

    <p>The chakór is mentioned by Baber (p. 282); and also by the Hindi poet Chand
      (<cite>Rás Mála</cite>, I. 230, and <cite>Ind. Antiquary</cite>, I. 273). If the latter passage
      is genuine, it is adverse to my Mongol etymology, as Chand lived before the
      Mongol era.</p>

    <p>The keeping of partridges for the table is alluded to by Chaucer in his
      portrait of the Franklin, <cite>Prologue, Cant. Tales</cite>:</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_LXI1"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER LXI</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">Of the City of Chandu, and the Kaan’s Palace there.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> when you have ridden three days from the city last mentioned, between
    north-east and north, you come to a city called <span class="smcap">Chandu</span>,<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI11" href="#Note_LXI11" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> which
    was built by the Kaan now reigning. There is at this place a very fine
    marble Palace, the rooms of which are all gilt and painted with figures
    of men and beasts and birds, and with a variety of trees and flowers, all
    executed with such exquisite art that you regard them with delight and
    astonishment.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI12" href="#Note_LXI12" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>Round this Palace a wall is built, inclosing a compass <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>of 16 miles, and
    inside the Park there are fountains and rivers and brooks, and beautiful
    meadows, with all kinds of wild animals (excluding such as are of ferocious
    nature), which the Emperor has procured and placed there to supply food for
    his gerfalcons and hawks, which he keeps there in mew. Of these there are
    more than 200 gerfalcons alone, without reckoning the other hawks. The Kaan
    himself goes every week to see his birds sitting in mew, and sometimes he
    rides through the park with a leopard behind him on his horse’s croup; and
    then if he sees any animal that takes his fancy, he slips his leopard at
    it,<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI13" href="#Note_LXI13" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> and the game when taken is made over to feed the hawks in mew.
    This he does for diversion.</p>

  <p>Moreover [at a spot in the Park where there is a charming wood] he has
    another Palace built of cane, of which I must give you a description. It is
    gilt all over, and most elaborately finished inside. [It is stayed on gilt
    and lackered columns, on each of which is a dragon all gilt, the tail of
    which is attached to the column whilst the head supports the architrave,
    and the claws likewise are stretched out right and left to support the
    architrave.] The roof, like the rest, is formed of canes, covered with
    a varnish so strong and excellent that no amount of rain will rot them.
    These canes are a good 3 palms in girth, and from 10 to 15 paces in length.
    [They are cut across at each knot, and then the pieces are split so as to
    form from each two hollow tiles, and with these the house is roofed; only
    every such tile of cane has to be nailed down to prevent the wind from
    lifting it.] In short, the whole Palace is built of these canes, which (I
    may mention) serve also for a great variety of other useful purposes. The
    construction of the Palace is so devised that it can be taken down and put
    up again with great celerity; and it can all be taken <span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>to pieces and removed
    whithersoever the Emperor may command. When erected, it is braced [against
    mishaps from the wind] by more than 200 cords of silk.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI14" href="#Note_LXI14" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>The Lord abides at this Park of his, dwelling sometimes in the Marble
    Palace and sometimes in the Cane Palace for three months of the year, to
    wit, June, July, and August; preferring this residence because it is by no
    means hot; in fact it is a very cool place. When the 28th day of [the Moon
    of] August arrives he takes his departure, and the Cane Palace is taken to
    pieces.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI15" href="#Note_LXI15" class="fnanchor">{5}</a> But I must tell you what happens when he goes away from
    this Palace every year on the 28th of the August [Moon].</p>

  <p>You must know that the Kaan keeps an immense stud of white horses and
    mares; in fact more than 10,000 of them, and all pure white without a
    speck. The milk of these mares is drunk by himself and his family, and by
    none else, except by those of one great tribe that have also the privilege
    of drinking it. This privilege was granted them by Chinghis Kaan, on
    account of a certain victory that they helped him to win long ago. The name
    of the tribe is <span class="smcap">Horiad</span>.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI16" href="#Note_LXI16" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <p>Now when these mares are passing across the country, and any one falls in
    with them, be he the greatest lord in the land, he must not presume to
    pass until the mares have gone by; he must either tarry where he is, or
    go a half-day’s journey round if need so be, so as not to come nigh them;
    for they are to be treated with the greatest respect. Well, when the Lord
    sets out from the Park on the 28th of August, as I told you, the milk of
    all those mares is taken and sprinkled on the ground. And this is done on
    the injunction of the Idolaters and Idol-priests, who say that it is an
    excellent thing to sprinkle that milk on the ground every 28th of August,
    so that the Earth and the Air <span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>and the False Gods shall have their share of
    it, and the Spirits likewise that inhabit the Air and the Earth. And thus
    those beings will protect and bless the Kaan and his children and his wives
    and his folk and his gear, and his cattle and his horses, his corn and all
    that is his. After this is done, the Emperor is off and away.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI17" href="#Note_LXI17" class="fnanchor">{7}</a></p>

  <p>But I must now tell you a strange thing that hitherto I have forgotten
    to mention. During the three months of every year that the Lord resides
    at that place, if it should happen to be bad weather, there are certain
    crafty enchanters and astrologers in his train, who are such adepts in
    necromancy and the diabolic arts, that they are able to prevent any cloud
    or storm from passing over the spot on which the Emperor’s Palace stands.
    The sorcerers who do this are called <span class="smcap">Tebet</span> and <span class="smcap">Kesimur</span>, which are the names
    of two nations of Idolaters. Whatever they do in this way is by the help
    of the Devil, but they make those people believe that it is compassed by
    dint of their own sanctity and the help of God.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI18" href="#Note_LXI18" class="fnanchor">{8}</a> [They always go in
    a state of dirt and uncleanness, devoid of respect for themselves, or for
    those who see them, unwashed, unkempt, and sordidly attired.]</p>

  <p>These people also have a custom which I must tell you. If a man is
    condemned to death and executed by the lawful authority, they take his body
    and cook and eat it. But if any one die a natural death then they will not
    eat the body.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI19" href="#Note_LXI19" class="fnanchor">{9}</a></p>

  <p>There is another marvel performed by those <span class="smcap">Bacsi</span>, of whom I have been
    speaking as knowing so many enchantments.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI110" href="#Note_LXI110" class="fnanchor">{10}</a> For when the Great Kaan
    is at his capital and in his great Palace, seated at his table, which
    stands on a platform some eight cubits above the ground, his cups are set
    before him [on a great buffet] in the middle of the hall pavement, at a
    distance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>of some ten paces from his table, and filled with wine, or other
    good spiced liquor such as they use. Now when the Lord desires to drink,
    these enchanters by the power of their enchantments cause the cups to
    move from their place without being touched by anybody, and to present
    themselves to the Emperor! This every one present may witness, and there
    are ofttimes more than 10,000 persons thus present. ’Tis a truth and no
    lie! and so will tell you the sages of our own country who understand
    necromancy, for they also can perform it.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI111" href="#Note_LXI111" class="fnanchor">{11}</a></p>

  <p>And when the Idol Festivals come round, these <em>Bacsi</em> go to the Prince and
    say: “Sire, the Feast of such a god is come” (naming him). “My Lord, you
    know,” the enchanter will say, “that this god, when he gets no offerings,
    always sends bad weather and spoils our seasons. So we pray you to give us
    such and such a number of black-faced sheep,” naming whatever number they
    please. “And we beg also, good my lord, that we may have such a quantity of
    incense, and such a quantity of lignaloes, and”—so much of this, so much of
    that, and so much of t’other, according to their fancy—“that we may perform
    a solemn service and a great sacrifice to our Idols, and that so they may
    be induced to protect us and all that is ours.”</p>

  <p>The <em>Bacsi</em> say these things to the Barons entrusted with the Stewardship,
    who stand round the Great Kaan, and these repeat them to the Kaan, and
    he then orders the Barons to give everything that the Bacsi have asked
    for. And when they have got the articles they go and make a great feast
    in honour of their god, and hold great ceremonies of worship with grand
    illuminations and quantities of incense of a variety of odours, which they
    make up from different aromatic spices. And <span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>then they cook the meat, and
    set it before the idols, and sprinkle the broth hither and thither, saying
    that in this way the idols get their bellyful. Thus it is that they keep
    their festivals. You must know that each of the idols has a name of his
    own, and a feast-day, just as our Saints have their anniversaries.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI112" href="#Note_LXI112" class="fnanchor">{12}</a></p>

  <p>They have also immense Minsters and Abbeys, some of them as big as a small
    town, with more than two thousand monks (<i>i.e.</i> after their fashion) in a
    single abbey.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI113" href="#Note_LXI113" class="fnanchor">{13}</a> These monks dress more decently than the rest of
    the people, and have the head and beard shaven. There are some among these
    <em>Bacsi</em> who are allowed by their rule to take wives, and who have plenty of
    children.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI114" href="#Note_LXI114" class="fnanchor">{14}</a></p>

  <p>Then there is another kind of devotees called <span class="smcap">Sensin</span>, who are men of
    extraordinary abstinence after their fashion, and lead a life of such
    hardship as I will describe. All their life long they eat nothing but
    bran,<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI115" href="#Note_LXI115" class="fnanchor">{15}</a> which they take mixt with hot water. That is their food:
    bran, and nothing but bran; and water for their drink. ’Tis a lifelong
    fast! so that I may well say their life is one of extraordinary asceticism.
    They have great idols, and plenty of them; but they sometimes also
    worship fire. The other Idolaters who are not of this sect call these
    people heretics—<em>Patarins</em> as we should say<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI116" href="#Note_LXI116" class="fnanchor">{16}</a>—because they do not
    worship their idols in their own fashion. Those of whom I am speaking
    would not take a wife on any consideration.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI117" href="#Note_LXI117" class="fnanchor">{17}</a> They wear dresses of
    hempen stuff, black and blue,<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI118" href="#Note_LXI118" class="fnanchor">{18}</a> and sleep upon mats; in fact their
    asceticism is something astonishing. Their idols are all feminine, that is
    to say, they have women’s names.<a id="NoteAnchor_LXI119" href="#Note_LXI119" class="fnanchor">{19}</a></p>

  <p>Now let us have done with this subject, and let me tell you of the great
    state and wonderful magnificence of the Great Lord of Lords; I mean that
    great Prince <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>who is the Sovereign of the Tartars, <span class="smcap">Cublay</span> by name, that most
    noble and puissant Lord.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_LXI11" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI11" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—[There were two roads to go from Peking to Shangtu: the eastern
      road through Tu-shi-k’ow, and the western (used for the return journey)
      road by Ye-hu ling. Polo took this last road, which ran from Peking to
      Siuen-te chau through the same places as now; but from the latter town
      it led, not to Kalgan as it does now, but more to the west, to a place
      called now Shan-fang pú where the pass across the Ye-hu ling range
      begins. “On both these roads <em>nabo</em>, or temporary palaces, were built, as
      resting-places for the Khans; eighteen on the eastern road, and twenty-four
      on the western.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 25.) The same author makes (p. 26) the
      following remarks: “M. Polo’s statement that he travelled three days from
      Siuen-te chau to Chagannor, and three days also from the latter place to
      Shang-tu, agrees with the information contained in the ‘Researches on the
      Routes to Shangtu.’ The Chinese authors have not given the precise position
      of Lake Chagannor; there are several lakes in the desert on the road to
      Shangtu, and their names have changed with time. The palace in Chagannor
      was built in 1280” (according to the <cite>Siu t’ung kien</cite>).—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI12" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI12" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      2.</a>—<em>Chandu</em>, called more correctly in Ramusio <em>Xandu</em>, <i>i.e.</i> <span class="smcap">Shandu</span>,
      and by Fr. Odorico <em>Sandu</em>, viz. <span class="smcap">Shang-Tu</span> or “Upper Court,” the Chinese
      title of Kúblái’s summer residence at Kaipingfu, <em>Mongolicè</em> Keibung (see
      <a href="#CHAPTER_XIIIp">ch. xiii.</a> of Prologue) [is called also <em>Loan king</em>, <i>i.e.</i> “the capital on
      the Loan River,” according to Palladius, p. 26.—H.&nbsp;C.]. The ruins still
      exist, in about lat. 40° 22′, and a little west of the longitude of Peking.
      The site is 118 miles in direct line from Chaghan-nor, making Polo’s three
      marches into rides of unusual length.<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The ruins bear the Mongol name
      of <em>Chao Naiman Sumé Khotan</em>, meaning “city of the 108 temples,” and are
      about 26 miles to the north-west of Dolon-nor, a bustling, dirty town
      of modern origin, famous for the manufactory of idols, bells, and other
      ecclesiastical paraphernalia of Buddhism. The site was visited (though
      not described) by Père Gerbillon in 1691, and since then by no European
      traveller till 1872, when Dr. Bushell of the British Legation at Peking,
      and the Hon. T. G. Grosvenor, made a journey thither from the capital,
      by way of the Nan-kau Pass (<i>supra</i> <a href="#Page_26">p. 26</a>), Kalgan, and the vicinity of
      Chaghan-nor, the route that would seem to have been habitually followed, in
      their annual migration, by Kúblái and his successors.</p>

    <p>The deserted site, overgrown with rank weeds and grass, stands but little
      above the marshy bed of the river, which here preserves the name of Shang-tu,
      and about a mile from its north or left bank. The walls, of earth faced
      with brick and unhewn stone, still stand, forming, as in the Tartar city of
      Peking, a double <em>enceinte</em>, of which the inner line no doubt represents
      the area of the “Marble Palace” of which Polo speaks. This forms a square
      of about 2 <i>li</i> (⅔ of a mile) to the side, and has three gates—south,
      east, and west, of which the southern one still stands intact, a perfect
      arch, 20 ft. high and 12 ft. wide. The outer wall forms a square of 4
      <i>li</i> (1⅓ mile) to the side, and has six gates. The foundations of temples
      and palace-buildings can be traced, and both enclosures are abundantly
      strewn with blocks of marble and fragments of lions, dragons, and other
      sculptures, testifying to the former existence of a flourishing city, but
      exhibiting now scarcely one stone upon another. A broken memorial tablet
      was found, half buried in the ground, within the north-east angle of the
      outer rampart, bearing an inscription in an antique form of the Chinese
      character, which proves it to have been erected by Kúblái, in honour of a
      Buddhist ecclesiastic called Yun-Hien. Yun-Hien was the abbot of one of
      those great minsters and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>abbeys of <em>Bacsis</em>, of which Marco speaks, and
      the exact date (no longer visible) of the monument was equivalent to <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
      1288.<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

    <p>This city occupies the south-east angle of a more extensive enclosure,
      bounded by what is now a grassy mound, and embracing, on Dr. Bushell’s
      estimate, about 5 square miles. Further knowledge may explain the
      discrepancy from Marco’s dimension, but this must be the park of which he
      speaks.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The woods and fountains have disappeared, like the temples and
      palaces; all is dreary and desolate, though still abounding in the game
      which was one of Kúblái’s attractions to the spot. A small monastery,
      occupied by six or seven wretched Lamas, is the only building that remains
      in the vicinity. The river Shangtu, which lower down becomes the Lan [or
      Loan]-Ho, was formerly navigated from the sea up to this place by flat
      grain-boats.</p>

    <p>[Mgr. de Harlez gave in the <cite>T’oung Pao</cite> (x. p. 73) an inscription in
      <em>Chuen</em> character on a <em>stele</em> found in the ruins of Shangtu, and built by
      an officer with the permission of the Emperor; it is probably a token of
      imperial favour; the inscription means: <em>Great Longevity</em>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>In the wail which Sanang Setzen, the poetical historian of the Mongols,
      puts, perhaps with some traditional basis, into the mouth of Toghon Temur,
      the last of the Chinghizide Dynasty in China, when driven from his throne,
      the changes are rung on the lost glories of his capital <em>Daïtu</em> (see <i>infra</i>,
      Book II. ch. xi.) and his summer palace <em>Shangtu</em>; thus (I translate from
      Schott’s amended German rendering of the Mongol):</p>

    <div class="center-container">

    <p>It was, in 1797, whilst reading this passage of Marco’s narrative in old
      Purchas that Coleridge fell asleep, and dreamt the dream of Kúblái’s
      Paradise, beginning:</p>

    <p>It would be a singular coincidence in relation to this poem were Klaproth’s
      reading correct of a passage in Rashiduddin which he renders as saying that
      the palace at Kaiminfu was “called Langtin, and was built after a plan that
      Kúblái had seen in a dream, and had retained in his memory.” But I suspect
      D’Ohsson’s reading is more accurate, which runs: “Kúblái caused a Palace
      to be built for him east of Kaipingfu, called Lengten; <em>but he abandoned
      it in consequence of a dream.</em>” For we see from Sanang Setzen that the
      Palaces of Lengten and Kaiming or Shangtu were distinct; “Between the year
      of the Rat (1264), when Kúblái was fifty years old, and the year of the
      Sheep (1271), in the space of eight years, he built four great cities, viz.
      for Summer Residence <span class="smcap">Shangtu Keibung</span> Kürdu Balgasun, for Winter Residence
      Yeke <span class="smcap">Daïtu</span> Khotan, and on the shady side of the Altai (see <a href="#Note_LI13">ch. li. note
      3</a>, <i>supra</i>) Arulun <span class="smcap">Tsaghan Balgasun</span>, and Erchügin <span class="smcap">Langting</span> Balgasun.” A
      valuable letter from Dr. Bushell enables me now to indicate the position of
      Langtin: “The district through which the river flows eastward from Shangtu
      is known to the Mongolians of the present day by the name of <em>Lang-tírh</em>
      (<em>Lang-ting’rh</em>).... The ruins of the city are marked on a Chinese map
      in my possession Pai-dseng-tzu, <i>i.e.</i> ‘White City,’ implying that it was
      formerly an Imperial residence. The remains of the wall are 7 or 8 <i>li</i>
      in diameter, of stone, and situated about 40 <i>li</i> north-north-west from
      Dolon-nor.”</p>

    <p>One of the pavilions of the celebrated Yuen-ming-Yuen may give some idea of
      the probable style, though not of the scale, of Kúblái’s Summer Palace.</p>

    <p>Hiuen Tsang’s account of the elaborate and fantastic ornamentation of the
      famous Indian monasteries at Nalanda in Bahár, where Mr. Broadley has
      lately made such remarkable discoveries, seems to indicate that these
      fantasies of Burmese and Chinese architecture may have had a direct
      origin in India, at a time when timber was still a principal material of
      construction there: “The pavilions had pillars adorned with dragons, and
      posts that glowed with all the colours of the rainbow, sculptured frets,
      columns set with jade, richly chiselled and lackered, with balustrades of
      vermilion, and carved open work. The lintels of the doors were tastefully
      ornamented, and the roofs covered with shining tiles, the splendours of
      which were multiplied by mutual reflection and from moment to moment took a
      thousand forms.” (<cite>Vie et Voyages</cite>, 157.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI13" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI13" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—[Rubruck says (<cite>Rockhill</cite>, p. 248): “I saw also the envoy
      of a certain Soldan of India, who had brought eight leopards and ten
      <em>greyhounds</em>, taught to sit on horses’ backs, as leopards sit.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI14" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI14" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—Ramusio’s is here so much more lucid than the other texts, that
      I have adhered mainly to his account of the building. The roof described
      is of a kind in use in the Indian Archipelago, and in some other parts of
      Transgangetic India, in which the semi-cylinders of bamboo are laid just
      like Roman tiles.</p>

    <p>Rashiduddin gives a curious account of the way in which the foundations of
      the terrace on which this palace stood were erected in a lake. He says,
      too, in accord with Polo: “Inside the city itself a second palace was
      built, about a bowshot from the first: but the Kaan generally takes up his
      residence in the palace outside the town,” <i>i.e.</i>, as I imagine, in Marco’s
      Cane Palace. (<cite>Cathay</cite>, pp. 261–262.)</p>

    <p>[“The <em>Palace of canes</em> is probably the Palm Hall, <em>Tsung tien</em>, alias
      <em>Tsung mao tien</em>, of the Chinese authors, which was situated in the western
      palace garden of Shangtu. Mention is made also in the <em>Altan Tobchi</em> of a
      cane tent in Shangtu.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 27.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

    <p>Marco might well say of the bamboo that “it serves also a great variety
      of other purposes.” An intelligent native of Arakan who accompanied me in
      wanderings on duty in the forests of the Burmese frontier in the beginning
      of 1853, and who used to ask many questions about Europe, seemed able
      to apprehend almost everything except the possibility of existence in a
      country without bamboos! “When I speak of bamboo huts, I mean to say that
      posts and walls, wall-plates and rafters, floor and thatch, and the withes
      that bind them, are all of bamboo. In fact, it might almost be said that
      among the Indo-Chinese nations the staff of life is <em>a bamboo!</em> Scaffolding
      and ladders, landing-jetties, fishing apparatus, irrigation wheels and
      scoops, oars, masts, and yards [and in China, sails, cables, and caulking,
      asparagus, medicine, and works of fantastic art], spears and arrows,
      hats and helmets, bow, bowstring and quiver, oil-cans, water-stoups <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>and
      cooking-pots, pipe-sticks [tinder and means of producing fire], conduits,
      clothes-boxes, pawn-boxes, dinner-trays, pickles, preserves, and melodious
      musical instruments, torches, footballs, cordage, bellows, mats, paper;
      these are but a few of the articles that are made from the bamboo;” and
      in China, to sum up the whole, as Barrow observes, it maintains order
      throughout the Empire! (<cite>Ava Mission</cite>, p. 153; and see also <cite>Wallace, Ind.
      Arch.</cite> I. 120 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>

      who succeeded him followed his example.” (<cite>Gaubil</cite>, p. 144.)</p>

    <p>[“The Khans usually resorted to Shangtu in the 4th moon and returned to
      Peking in the 9th. On the 7th day of the 7th moon there were libations
      performed in honour of the ancestors; a shaman, his face to the north,
      uttered in a loud voice the names of Chingiz Khan and of other deceased
      Khans, and poured mare’s milk on the ground. The propitious day for the
      return journey to Peking was also appointed then.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 26.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI16" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI16" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—White horses were presented in homage to the Kaan on New Year’s Day
      (<em>the White Feast</em>), as we shall see below. (<a href="#CHAPTER_XV2">Bk. II. ch. xv.</a>) Odoric also
      mentions this practice; and, according to Huc, the Mongol chiefs continued
      it at least to the time of the Emperor K’ang-hi. Indeed Timkowski speaks
      of annual tributes of white camels and white horses from the Khans of
      the Kalkas and other Mongol dignitaries, in the present century. (<cite>Huc’s
      Tartary</cite>, etc.; <cite>Tim.</cite> II. 33.)</p>

    <p>By the <span class="smcap">Horiad</span> are no doubt intended the <span class="smcap">Uirad</span> or <span class="smcap">Oirad</span>, a name usually
      interpreted as signifying the “Closely Allied,” or Confederates; but
      Vámbéry explains it as (Turki) <em>Oyurat</em>, “Grey horse,” to which the
      statement in our text appears to lend colour. They were not of the tribes
      properly called Mongol, but after their submission to Chinghiz they
      remained closely attached to him. In Chinghiz’s victory over Aung-Khan, as
      related by S. Setzen, we find Turulji Taishi, the son of the chief of the
      Oirad, one of Chinghiz’s three chief captains; perhaps that is the victory
      alluded to. The seats of the Oirad appear to have been about the head
      waters of the Kem, or Upper Yenisei.</p>

    <p>In <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1295 there took place a curious desertion from the service of
      Gházán Khan of Persia of a vast corps of the Oirad, said to amount to
      18,000 <em>tents</em>. They made their way to Damascus, where they were well
      received by the Mameluke Sultan. But their heathenish practices gave
      dire offence to the Faithful. They were settled in the <em>Sáhil</em>, or coast
      districts of Palestine. Many died speedily; the rest embraced Islam, spread
      over the country, and gradually became absorbed in the general population.
      Their sons and daughters were greatly admired for their beauty. (<cite>S. Setz.</cite>

    <p>[With reference to Yule’s conjecture, I may quote Palladius (<i>l.c.</i> p. 27):
      “It is, however, strange that the Oirats alone enjoyed the privilege
      described by Marco Polo; for the highest position at the Mongol Khan’s
      court belonged to the Kunkrat tribe, out of which the Khans used to choose
      their first wives, who were called Empresses of the first <em>ordo</em>.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      day of the May Moon they collect all the white mares of their herds and
      consecrate them. The Christian priests also must then assemble with their
      thuribles. They then sprinkle new cosmos (<em>kumíz</em>) on the ground, and make
      a great feast that day, for according to their calendar, it is their time
      of first drinking new cosmos, just as we reckon of our new wine at the
      feast of St. Bartholomew (24th August), or that of St. Sixtus (6th August),
      or of our fruit on the feast of St. James and St. Christopher” (25th July).
      [With reference to this feast, Mr. Rockhill gives (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 241, note)
      extracts from <cite>Pallas, Voyages</cite>, IV. 579, and <cite>Professor Radloff, Aus
      Siberien</cite>, I. 378.—H.&nbsp;C.] <span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>The Yakuts also hold such a festival in June or
      July, when the mares foal, and immense wooden goblets of kumíz are emptied
      on that occasion. They also pour out kumíz for the Spirits to the four
      quarters of heaven.</p>

    <p>The following passage occurs in the narrative of the Journey of Chang
      Te-hui, a Chinese teacher, who was summoned to visit the camp of Kúblái in
      Mongolia, some twelve years before that Prince ascended the throne of the
      Kaans:<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

    <p>“On the 9th day of the 9th Moon (October), the Prince, having called his
      subjects before his chief tent, performed the libation of the milk of a
      white mare. This was the customary sacrifice at that time. The vessels used
      were made of birch-bark, not ornamented with either silver or gold. Such
      here is the respect for simplicity....</p>

    <p>“At the last day of the year the Mongols suddenly changed their
      camping-ground to another place, for the mutual congratulation on the 1st
      Moon. Then there was every day feasting before the tents for the lower
      ranks. Beginning with the Prince, all dressed themselves in white fur
      clothing....<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

    <p>“On the 9th day of the 4th Moon (May) the Prince again collected his
      vassals before the chief tent for the libation of the milk of a white mare.
      This sacrifice is performed twice a year.”</p>

    <p>It has been seen (p. 308) that Rubruquis also names the 9th day of the May
      moon as that of the consecration of the white mares. The autumn libation is
      described by Polo as performed on the 28th day of the August moon, probably
      because it was unsuited to the circumstances of the Court at Cambaluc,
      where the Kaan was during October, and the day named was the last of his
      annual stay in the Mongolian uplands.</p>

    <p>Baber tells that among the ceremonies of a Mongol Review the Khan and
      his staff took kumíz and sprinkled it towards the standards. An Armenian
      author of the Mongol era says that it was the custom of the Tartars, before
      drinking, to sprinkle drink towards heaven, and towards the four quarters.
      Mr. Atkinson notices the same practice among the Kirghiz; and I found the
      like in old days among the Kasias of the eastern frontier of Bengal.</p>

    <p>The time of year assigned by Polo for the ceremony implies some change.
      Perhaps it had been made to coincide with the Festival of Water
      Consecration of the Lamas, with which the time named in the text seems
      to correspond. On that occasion the Lamas go in procession to the rivers
      and lakes and consecrate them by benediction and by casting in offerings,
      attended by much popular festivity.</p>

    <p>Rubruquis seems to intimate that the Nestorian priests were employed to
      consecrate the white mares by incensing them. In the rear of Lord Canning’s
      camp in India I once came upon the party of his <em>Shutr Suwárs</em>, or
      dromedary-express riders, busily engaged in incensing with frankincense the
      whole of the dromedaries, which were kneeling in a circle. I could get no
      light on the practice, but it was very probably a relic of the old Mongol
      custom. (<cite>Rubr.</cite> 363; <cite>Erman</cite>, II. 397; <cite>Billings’ Journey</cite>, Fr. Tr. I.

      8.</a>—The practice of weather-conjuring was in great vogue among the
      Mongols, and is often alluded to in their history.</p>

    <p>The operation was performed by means of a stone of magical virtues, called
      <em>Yadah</em> or <em>Jadah-Tásh</em>, which was placed in or hung over a basin of water
      with sundry ceremonies. The possession of such a stone is ascribed by the
      early Arab traveller Ibn Mohalhal to the <em>Ḳímák</em>, a great tribe of the
      Turks. In the war raised against Chinghiz and Aung Khan, when still allies,
      by a great confederation of the Naiman and other tribes in 1202, we are
      told that Sengun, the son of Aung Khan, when sent to meet the enemy, caused
      them to be enchanted, so that all their attempted movements <span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>against him
      were defeated by snow and mist. The fog and darkness were indeed so dense
      that many men and horses fell over precipices, and many also perished
      with cold. In another account of (apparently) the same matter, given by
      Mir-Khond, the conjuring is set on foot by the <em>Yadachi</em> of Buyruk Khan,
      Prince of the Naiman, but the mischief all rebounds on the conjurer’s own side.</p>

    <p>In Tului’s invasion of Honan in 1231–1232, Rashiduddin describes him, when
      in difficulty, as using the <em>Jadah</em> stone with success.</p>

    <p>Timur, in his Memoirs, speaks of the Jets using incantations to produce
      heavy rains which hindered his cavalry from acting against them. A
      <em>Yadachi</em> was captured, and when his head had been taken off the storm
      ceased.</p>

    <p>Baber speaks of one of his early friends, Khwaja Ka Mulai, as excelling
      in falconry and acquainted with <em>Yadagarí</em> or the art of bringing on rain
      and snow by means of enchantment. When the Russians besieged Kazan in 1552
      they suffered much from the constant heavy rains, and this annoyance was
      universally ascribed to the arts of the Tartar Queen, who was celebrated as
      an enchantress. Sháh Abbás believed he had learned the Tartar secret, and
      put much confidence in it. (<cite>P. Della V.</cite> I. 869.)</p>

    <p>[Grenard says (II. p. 256) the most powerful and most feared of sorcerers
      [in Chinese Turkestan] is the <em>djâduger</em>, who, to produce rain or fine
      weather, uses a jade stone, given by Noah to Japhet. Grenard adds (II.
      406–407) there are sorcerers (Ngag-pa-snags-pa) whose specialty is to make
      rain fall; they are similar to the Turkish <em>Yadachi</em> and like them use a
      stone called “water cristal,” <em>chu shel</em>; probably jade stone.</p>

    <p>Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 245, note) writes: “Rashideddin states that
      when the Urianghit wanted to bring a storm to an end, they said injuries to
      the sky, the lightning and thunder. I have seen this done myself by Mongol
      storm-dispellers. (See <cite>Diary</cite>, 201, 203.) ‘The other Mongol people,’ he
      adds, ‘do the contrary. When the storm rumbles, they remain shut up in
      their huts, full of fear.’ The subject of storm-making, and the use of
      stones for that purpose, is fully discussed by Quatremère, <cite>Histoire</cite>,
      438–440.” (Cf. also <cite>Rockhill</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 254.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>An edict of the Emperor Shi-tsung, of the reigning dynasty, addressed
      in 1724–1725 to the Eight Banners of Mongolia, warns them against this
      rain-conjuring: “If I,” indignantly observes the Emperor, “offering prayer
      in sincerity have yet room to fear that it may please Heaven to leave <span class="allsmcap">MY</span>
      prayer unanswered, it is truly intolerable that mere common people wishing
      for rain should at their own caprice set up altars of earth, and bring
      together a rabble of Hoshang (Buddhist Bonzes) and Taossé to conjure the
      spirits to gratify their wishes.”</p>

    <p>[“Lamas were of various extraction; at the time of the great assemblies,
      and of the Khan’s festivities in Shangtu, they erected an altar near the
      Khan’s tent and prayed for fine weather; the whistling of shells rose
      up to heaven.” These are the words in which Marco Polo’s narrative is
      corroborated by an eye-witness who has celebrated the remarkable objects of
      Shangtu (<em>Loan king tsa yung</em>). These Lamas, in spite of the prohibition
      by the Buddhist creed of bloody sacrifices, used to sacrifice sheep’s
      hearts to Mahakala. It happened, as it seems, that the heart of an executed
      criminal was also considered an agreeable offering; and as the offerings
      could be, after the ceremony, eaten by the sacrificing priests, Marco Polo
      had some reason to accuse the Lamas of cannibalism. (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 28.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The practice of weather-conjuring is not yet obsolete in Tartary, Tibet,
      and the adjoining countries.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

    <p>Weather-conjuring stories were also rife in Europe during the Middle Ages.
      One <span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>such is conspicuously introduced in connection with a magical fountain
      in the romance of the <cite>Chevalier au Lyon</cite>:</p>

      (<cite>De Naturis Rerum</cite>, Bk. II. ch. vii.)</p>

    <p>In the <cite>Cento Novelle Antiche</cite> also certain necromancers exhibit their
      craft before the Emperor Frederic (Barbarossa apparently): “The weather
      began to be overcast, and lo! of a sudden rain began to fall with
      continued thunders and lightnings, as if the world were come to an end,
      and hailstones that looked like steel-caps,” etc. Various other European
      legends of like character will be found in <cite>Liebrecht’s Gervasius von
      Tilbury</cite>, pp. 147–148.</p>

    <p>Rain-makers there are in many parts of the world; but it is remarkable that
      those also of Samoa in the Pacific operate by means of a <em>rain-stone</em>.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI19" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI19" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 9.</a>—It is not clear whether Marco attributes this cannibalism to the
      Tibetans and Kashmirians, or brings it in as a particular of Tartar custom
      which he had forgotten to mention before.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

    <p>The accusations of cannibalism indeed against the Tibetans in old accounts
      are frequent, and I have elsewhere (see <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 151) remarked on some
      singular Tibetan practices which go far to account for such charges. Della
      Penna, too, makes a statement which bears curiously on the present passage.
      Remarking on the great use made by certain classes of the Lamas of human
      skulls for magical cups, and of human thigh bones for flutes and whistles,
      he says that to supply them with these <em>the bodies of executed criminals
      were stored up at the disposal of the Lamas</em>; and a Hindu account of Tibet
      in the <cite>Asiatic Researches</cite> asserts that when one is killed in a fight both
      parties rush forward and struggle for the liver, which they eat (vol. xv).</p>

    <p>[Carpini says of the people of Tibet: “They are pagans; they have a most
      astonishing, or rather horrible, custom, for, when any one’s father is
      about to give up the ghost, all the relatives meet together, and they eat
      him, as was told to me for certain.” Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 152, note)
      writes: “So far as I am aware, this charge [of cannibalism] is not made
      by any Oriental writer against the Tibetans, though both Arab travellers
      to China in the ninth century and Armenian historians of the thirteenth
      century say the Chinese practised cannibalism. The Armenians designate
      China by the name <em>Nankas</em>, which I take to be Chinese <em>Nan-kuo</em>, ‘southern
      country,’ the <em>Manzi</em> country of Marco Polo.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>But like charges of cannibalism are brought against both Chinese and
      Tartars very positively. Thus, without going back to the Anthropophagous
      Scythians of Ptolemy and Mela, we read in the <cite>Relations</cite> of the Arab
      travellers of the ninth century: “In China it occurs sometimes that the
      governor of a province revolts from his duty to the emperor. In such a case
      he is slaughtered and eaten. <em>In fact, the Chinese eat the flesh of all
      men who are executed by the sword</em>.” Dr. Rennie mentions a superstitious
      practice, the continued existence of which in our own day he has himself
      witnessed, and which might perhaps have given rise to some such statement
      as that of the Arab travellers, if it be not indeed a relic, in a mitigated
      form, of the very practice they assert to have prevailed. After an
      execution at Peking certain large pith balls are steeped in the blood, and
      under the name of <em>blood-bread</em> are sold as a medicine for consumption. <em>It
      is only to the blood of decapitated criminals that any such healing power
      is attributed</em>. It has been asserted in the annals of the <cite>Propagation de
      la Foi</cite> that the Chinese executioners of M. Chapdelaine, a missionary who
      was martyred in Kwang-si in 1856 (28th February), were seen to eat the
      heart of their victim; and M. Huot, a missionary in the Yun-nan province,
      recounts a case of cannibalism which he witnessed. Bishop Chauveau, at
      Ta Ts’ien-lu, told Mr. Cooper that he had seen men in one of the cities
      of Yun-nan eating the heart and brains of a celebrated robber who had
      been executed. Dr. Carstairs Douglas of Amoy also tells me that the like
      practices have occurred at Amoy and Swatau.</p>

    <p>[With reference to cannibalism in China see <cite>Medical Superstitions an
      Incentive to Anti-Foreign Riots in China</cite>, by <cite>D. J. Macgowan, North China
      Herald</cite>, 8th July, 1892, pp. 60–62. Mr. E. H. Parker (<cite>China Review</cite>,
      February–March, 1901, 136) relates that the inhabitants of a part of
      Kwang-si boiled and ate a Chinese officer who had been sent to pacify them.
      “The idea underlying this horrible act [cannibalism] is, that by eating a
      portion of the victim, especially the heart, one acquires the valour with
      which he was endowed.” (<cite>Dennys’ Folk-lore of China</cite>, 67.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Hayton, the Armenian, after relating the treason of a Saracen, called
      Parwana (he was an Iconian Turk), against Abaka Khan, says: “He was taken
      and cut in two, and orders were issued that in all the food eaten by Abaka
      there should be put a portion of the traitor’s flesh. Of this Abaka himself
      ate, and caused all his barons to partake. <em>And this was in accordance with
      the custom of the Tartars</em>.” The same story is related independently and
      differently by Friar Ricold, thus: “When the army of Abaga ran away from
      the Saracens in Syria, a certain great Tartar baron was arrested who had
      been guilty of treason. And when the Emperor Khan was giving the order for
      his execution the Tartar ladies and women interposed, and begged that he
      might be made over to them. Having got hold of the prisoner they boiled him
      alive, and cutting his body up into mince-meat gave it to eat to the whole
      army, as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>an example to others.” Vincent of Beauvais makes a like statement:
      “When they capture any one who is at bitter enmity with them, they gather
      together and eat him in vengeance of his revolt, and like infernal leeches
      suck his blood,” a custom of which a modern Mongol writer thinks that he
      finds a trace in a surviving proverb. Among more remote and ignorant Franks
      the cannibalism of the Tartars was a general belief. Ivo of Narbonne, in
      his letter written during the great Tartar invasion of Europe (1242),
      declares that the Tartar chiefs, with their dog’s head followers and other
      <em>Lotophagi</em> (!), ate the bodies of their victims like so much bread; whilst
      a Venetian chronicler, speaking of the council of Lyons in 1274, says there
      was a discussion about making a general move against the Tartars, “<i lang="fr">porce
      qu’il manjuent la char humaine.</i>” These latter writers no doubt rehearsed
      mere popular beliefs, but Hayton and Ricold were both intelligent persons
      well acquainted with the Tartars, and Hayton at least not prejudiced
      against them.</p>

    <p>The old belief was revived in Prussia during the Seven Years’ War, in
      regard to the Kalmaks of the Russian army; and Bergmann says the old Kalmak
      warriors confessed to him that they had done what they could to encourage
      it by cutting up the bodies of the slain in presence of their prisoners,
      and roasting them! But Levchine relates an act on the part of the Kirghiz
      Kazaks which was no jest. They drank the blood of their victim if they did
      not eat his flesh.</p>

    <p>There is some reason to believe that cannibalism was in the Middle Ages
      generally a less strange and unwonted horror than we should at first blush
      imagine, and especially that it was an idea tolerably familiar in China.
      M. Bazin, in the second part of <cite>Chine Moderne</cite>, p. 461, after sketching
      a Chinese drama of the Mongol era (“The Devotion of Chao-li”), the plot
      of which turns on the acts of a body of cannibals, quotes several other
      passages from Chinese authors which indicate this. Nor is this wonderful in
      the age that had experienced the horrors of the Mongol wars.</p>

    <p>That was no doubt a fable which Carpini heard in the camp of the Great
      Kaan, that in one of the Mongol sieges in Cathay, when the army was
      without food, one man in ten of their own force was sacrificed to feed the
      remainder.<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But we are told in sober history that the force of Tului in
      Honan, in 1231–1232, was reduced to such straits as to eat grass and human
      flesh. At the siege of the Kin capital Kaifongfu, in 1233, the besieged
      were reduced to the like extremity; and the same occurred the same year
      at the siege of Tsaichau; and in 1262, when the rebel general Litan was
      besieged in Tsinanfu. The Taiping wars the other day revived the same
      horrors in all their magnitude. And savage acts of the same kind by the
      Chinese and their Turk partisans in the defence of Kashgar were related to
      Mr. Shaw.</p>

    <p>Probably, however, nothing of the kind in history equals what Abdallatif, a
      sober and scientific physician, describes as having occurred before his own
      eyes in the great Egyptian famine of <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span> 597 (1200). The horrid details
      fill a chapter of some length, and we need not quote from them.</p>

    <p>Nor was Christendom without the rumour of such barbarities. The story of
      King Richard’s banquet in presence of Saladin’s ambassadors on the head of
      a Saracen curried (for so it surely was),—</p>

      10.</a>—<em>Bakhshi</em> is generally believed to be a corruption of <em>Bhikshu</em>,
      the proper Sanscrit term for a religious mendicant, and in particular
      for the Buddhist devotees of that character. <em>Bakhshi</em> was probably
      applied to a class only of the Lamas, but among the Turks and Persians
      it became a generic name for them all. In this sense it is habitually
      used by Rashiduddin, and thus also in the Ain Akbari: “The learned among
      the Persians and Arabians call the priests of this (Buddhist) religion
      <em>Bukshee</em>, and in Tibbet they are styled Lamas.”</p>

    <p>According to Pallas the word among the modern Mongols is used in the sense
      of <em>Teacher</em>, and is applied to the oldest and most learned priest of a
      community, who is the local ecclesiastical chief. Among the Kirghiz Kazaks
      again, who profess Mahomedanism, the word also survives, but conveys among
      them just the idea that Polo seems to have associated with it, that of a
      mere conjuror or “medicine-man”; whilst in Western Turkestan it has come to
      mean a Bard.</p>

    <p>The word Bakhshi has, however, wandered much further from its original
      meaning. From its association with persons who could read and write, and
      who therefore occasionally acted as clerks, it came in Persia to mean a
      clerk or secretary. In the Petrarchian Vocabulary, published by Klaproth,
      we find <em>scriba</em> rendered in <em>Comanian</em>, <i>i.e.</i> Turkish of the Crimea,
      by <em>Bacsi</em>. The transfer of meaning is precisely parallel to that in
      regard to our <em>Clerk</em>. Under the Mahomedan sovereigns of India, <em>Bakhshi</em>
      was applied to an officer performing something like the duties of a
      quartermaster-general; and finally, in our Indian army, it has come to mean
      a paymaster. In the latter sense, I imagine it has got associated in the
      popular mind with the Persian <em>bakhshídan</em>, to bestow, and <em>bakhshísh</em>.
      (See a note in <cite>Q. R.</cite> p. 184 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 474; <cite>Ayeen Akbery</cite>,
      III. 150; <cite>Pallas, Samml.</cite> II. 126; <cite>Levchine</cite>, p. 355; <cite>Klap. Mém.</cite> III.;
      <cite>Vámbéry, Sketches</cite>, p. 81.)</p>

    <p>The sketch from the life, on <a href="#i326">p. 326</a>, of a wandering Tibetan devotee, whom I
      met once at Hardwár, may give an idea of the sordid <em>Bacsis</em> spoken of by
      Polo.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI111" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI111" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 11.</a>—This feat is related more briefly by Odoric: “And jugglers cause
      cups of gold full of good wine to fly through the air, and to offer
      themselves to all who list to drink.” (<cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 143.) In the note on
      that passage I have referred to a somewhat similar story in the <cite>Life of
      Apollonius</cite>. “Such feats,” says Mr. Jaeschke, “are often mentioned in
      ancient as well as modern legends of Buddha and other saints; and our Lamas
      have heard of things very similar performed by conjuring <cite>Bonpos</cite>.” (See <a href="#Page_323">p.
      323</a>.) The moving of cups and the like is one of the sorceries ascribed in
      old legends to Simon Magus: “He made statues to walk; leapt into the fire
      without being burnt; flew in the air; made bread of stones; changed his
      shape; assumed two faces at once; converted himself into a pillar; caused
      closed doors to fly open spontaneously; made the vessels in a house seem to
      move of themselves,” etc. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>Jesuit Delrio laments that credulous princes,
      otherwise of pious repute, should have allowed diabolic tricks to be played
      before them, “as, for example, things of iron, and silver goblets, or other
      heavy articles, to be moved by bounds from one end of a table to the other,
      without the use of a magnet or of any attachment.” The pious prince appears
      to have been Charles IX., and the conjuror a certain Cesare Maltesio.
      Another Jesuit author describes the veritable mango-trick, speaking of
      persons who “within three hours’ space did cause a genuine shrub of a span
      in length to grow out of the table, besides other trees that produced both
      leaves and fruit.”</p>

    <p>In a letter dated 1st December, 1875, written by Mr. R. B. Shaw, after his
      last return from Kashgar and Lahore, this distinguished traveller says: “I
      have heard stories related regarding a Buddhist high priest whose temple
      is said to be not far to the east of Lanchau, which reminds me of Marco
      Polo and Kúblái Khan. This high priest is said to have the magic power
      of attracting cups and plates to him from a distance, so that things fly
      through the air into his hands.” (<cite>MS. Note</cite>.—H.&nbsp;Y.)</p>

    <p>The profession and practice of exorcism and magic in general is greatly
      more prominent in Lamaism or Tibetan Buddhism than in any other known form
      of that religion. Indeed, the old form of Lamaism as it existed in our
      traveller’s day, and till the reforms of Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), and as
      it is still professed by the <em>Red</em> sect in Tibet, seems to be a kind of
      compromise between Indian Buddhism and the old indigenous Shamanism. Even
      the reformed doctrine of the Yellow sect recognises an orthodox kind of
      magic, which is due in great measure to the combination of Sivaism with the
      Buddhist doctrines, and of which the institutes are contained in the vast
      collection of the <em>Jud</em> or Tantras, recognised among the holy books. The
      magic arts of this code open even a short road to the Buddhahood itself. To
      attain that perfection of power and wisdom, culminating in the cessation
      of sensible existence, requires, according to the ordinary paths, a period
      of three <em>asankhyas</em> (or say Uncountable Time × 3), whereas by means of
      the magic arts of the <em>Tantras</em> it may be reached in the course of three
      <em>rebirths</em> only, nay, of one! But from the Tantras also can be learned how
      to acquire miraculous powers for objects entirely selfish and secular, and
      how to exercise these by means of <em>Dhárani</em> or mystic Indian charms.</p>

    <p>Still the orthodox Yellow Lamas professedly repudiate and despise the
      grosser exhibitions of common magic and charlatanism which the Reds still
      practise, such as knife-swallowing, blowing fire, cutting off their own
      heads, etc. But as the vulgar will not dispense with these marvels, every
      great orthodox monastery in Tibet <em>keeps a conjuror</em>, who is a member of
      the unreformed, and does not belong to the brotherhood of the convent,
      but lives in a particular part of it, bearing the name of <em>Choichong</em>,
      or protector of religion, and is allowed to marry. The magic of these
      Choichong is in theory and practice different from the orthodox Tantrist
      magic. The practitioners possess no literature, and hand down their
      mysteries only by tradition. Their fantastic equipments, their frantic
      bearing, and their cries and howls, seem to identify them with the grossest
      Shamanist devil dancers.</p>

    <p>Sanang Setzen enumerates a variety of the wonderful acts which could be
      performed through the <em>Dhárani</em>. Such were, sticking a peg into solid rock;
      restoring the dead to life; turning a dead body into gold; penetrating
      everywhere as air does; flying; catching wild beasts with the hand;
      reading thoughts; making water flow backwards; eating tiles; sitting in
      the air with the legs doubled under, etc. Some of these are precisely
      the powers ascribed to Medea, Empedocles, and Simon Magus, in passages
      already cited. Friar Ricold says on this subject: “There are certain men
      whom the Tartars honour above all in the world, viz. the <em>Baxitae</em> (<i>i.e.</i>
      <em>Bakhshis</em>), who are a kind of idol-priests. These are men from India,
      persons of deep wisdom, well-conducted, and of the gravest morals. They are
      usually acquainted with magic arts, and depend on the counsel and aid of
      demons; they exhibit many illusions, and predict some future events. For
      instance, one of eminence among them was said to fly; the truth, however,
      was (as it proved), that he did not fly, but did walk close to the surface
      of the ground without touching it; and <em>would seem to sit down without
      having any substance to support him</em>.” This last performance was witnessed
      by Ibn <span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>Batuta at Delhi, in the presence of Sultan Mahomed Tughlak; and it
      was professedly exhibited by a Brahmin at Madras in the present century,
      a descendant doubtless of those Brahmans whom Apollonius saw walking
      two cubits from the ground. It is also described by the worthy Francis
      Valentyn as a performance known and practised in his own day in India. It
      is related, he says, that “a man will first go and sit on three sticks
      put together so as to form a tripod; after which, first one stick, then a
      second, then the third shall be removed from under him, and the man shall
      not fall but shall still remain sitting in the air! Yet I have spoken with
      two friends who had seen this at one and the same time; and one of them,
      I may add, mistrusting his own eyes, had taken the trouble to feel about
      with a long stick if there were nothing on which the body rested; yet, as
      the gentleman told me, he could neither feel nor see any such thing. Still,
      I could only say that I could not believe it, as a thing too manifestly
      contrary to reason.”</p>

    <p>Akin to these performances, though exhibited by professed jugglers without
      claim to religious character, is a class of feats which might be regarded
      as simply inventions if told by one author only, but which seem to deserve
      prominent notice from their being recounted by a series of authors,
      certainly independent of one another, and writing at long intervals of time
      and place. Our first witness is Ibn Batuta, and it will be necessary to
      quote him as well as the others in full, in order to show how closely their
      evidence tallies. The Arab Traveller was present at a great entertainment
      at the Court of the Viceroy of Khansa (<em>Kinsay</em> of Polo, or Hang-chau
      fu): “That same night a juggler, who was one of the Kán’s slaves, made
      his appearance, and the Amír said to him, ‘Come and show us some of your
      marvels.’ Upon this he took a wooden ball, with several holes in it,
      through which long thongs were passed, and, laying hold of one of these,
      slung it into the air. It went so high that we lost sight of it altogether.
      (It was the hottest season of the year, and we were outside in the middle
      of the palace court.) There now remained only a little of the end of a
      thong in the conjuror’s hand, and he desired one of the boys who assisted
      him to lay hold of it and mount. He did so, climbing by the thong, and we
      lost sight of him also! The conjuror then called to him three times, but
      getting no answer, he snatched up a knife as if in a great rage, laid hold
      of the thong, and disappeared also! By and bye he threw down one of the
      boy’s hands, then a foot, then the other hand, and then the other foot,
      then the trunk, and last of all the head! Then he came down himself, all
      puffing and panting, and with his clothes all bloody, kissed the ground
      before the Amír, and said something to him in Chinese. The Amír gave
      some order in reply, and our friend then took the lad’s limbs, laid them
      together in their places, and gave a kick, when, presto! there was the boy,
      who got up and stood before us! All this astonished me beyond measure, and
      I had an attack of palpitation like that which overcame me once before in
      the presence of the Sultan of India, when he showed me something of the
      same kind. They gave me a cordial, however, which cured the attack. The
      Kazi Afkharuddin was next to me, and quoth he, ‘<em>Wallah!</em> ’tis my opinion
      there has been neither going up nor coming down, neither marring nor
      mending; ’tis all hocus pocus!’”</p>

    <p>Now let us compare with this, which Ibn Batuta the Moor says he saw
      in China about the year 1348, the account which is given us by Edward
      Melton, an Anglo-Dutch traveller, of the performances of a Chinese gang
      of conjurors, which he witnessed at Batavia about the year 1670 (I have
      forgotten to note the year). After describing very vividly the <em>basket-murder</em>
      trick, which is well known in India, and now also in Europe, and
      some feats of bamboo balancing similar to those which were recently shown
      by Japanese performers in England, only more wonderful, he proceeds: “But
      now I am going to relate a thing which surpasses all belief, and which
      I should scarcely venture to insert here had it not been witnessed by
      thousands before my own eyes. One of the same gang took a ball of cord,
      and grasping one end of the cord in his hand slung the other up into the
      air with such force that its extremity was beyond reach of our sight. He
      then immediately climbed up the cord with indescribable swiftness, and got
      so high that we could no longer see him. I stood full <span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>of astonishment, not
      conceiving what was to come of this; when lo! a leg came tumbling down
      out of the air. One of the conjuring company instantly snatched it up and
      threw it into the basket whereof I have formerly spoken. A moment later a
      hand came down, and immediately on that another leg. And in short all the
      members of the body came thus successively tumbling from the air and were
      cast together into the basket. The last fragment of all that we saw tumble
      down was the head, and no sooner had that touched the ground than he who
      had snatched up all the limbs and put them in the basket turned them all
      out again topsy-turvy. Then straightway we saw with these eyes all those
      limbs creep together again, and in short, form a whole man, who at once
      could stand and go just as before, without showing the least damage! Never
      in my life was I so astonished as when I beheld this wonderful performance,
      and I doubted now no longer that these misguided men did it by the help of
      the Devil. For it seems to me totally impossible that such things should
      be accomplished by natural means.” The same performance is spoken of by
      Valentyn, in a passage also containing curious notices of the basket-murder
      trick, the mango trick, the sitting in the air (quoted above), and others;
      but he refers to Melton, and I am not sure whether he had any other
      authority for it. The cut on this page is taken from Melton’s plate.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Again we have in the Memoirs of the Emperor Jahángir a detail of the
      wonderful performances of seven jugglers from Bengal who exhibited before
      him. Two of their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>feats are thus described: “<em>Ninth</em>. They produced a man
      whom they divided limb from limb, actually severing his head from the body.
      They scattered these mutilated members along the ground, and in this state
      they lay for some time. They then extended a sheet or curtain over the
      spot, and one of the men putting himself under the sheet, in a few minutes
      came from below, followed by the individual supposed to have been cut into
      joints, in perfect health and condition, and one might have safely sworn
      that he had never received wound or injury whatever ... <em>Twenty-third</em>.
      They produced a chain of 50 cubits in length, and in my presence threw one
      end of it towards the sky, <em>where it remained as if fastened to something
      in the air</em>. A dog was then brought forward, and being placed at the
      lower end of the chain, immediately ran up, and reaching the other end,
      <em>immediately disappeared in the air</em>. In the same manner a hog, a panther,
      a lion, and a tiger were successively sent up the chain, and all equally
      disappeared at the upper end of the chain. At last they took down the chain
      and put it into a bag, no one ever discovering in what way the different
      animals were made to vanish into the air in the mysterious manner above
      described.”</p>

    <p>[There would appear (says the <cite>Times of India</cite>, quoted by the <cite>Weekly
      Dispatch</cite>, 15th September, 1889) to be a fine field of unworked romance
      in the annals of Indian jugglery. One Siddeshur Mitter, writing to the
      Calcutta paper, gives a thrilling account of a conjurer’s feat which he
      witnessed recently in one of the villages of the Hooghly district. He
      saw the whole thing himself, he tells us, so there need be no question
      about the facts. On the particular afternoon when he visited the village
      the place was occupied by a company of male and female jugglers, armed
      with bags and boxes and musical instruments, and all the mysterious
      paraphernalia of the peripatetic <em>Jadugar</em>. While Siddeshur was looking
      on, and in the broad, clear light of the afternoon, a man was shut up in a
      box, which was then carefully nailed up and bound with cords. Weird spells
      and incantations of the style we are all familiar with were followed by
      the breaking open of the box, which, “to the unqualified amazement of
      everybody, was found to be perfectly empty.” All this is much in the usual
      style; but what followed was so much superior to the ordinary run of modern
      Indian jugglery that we must give it in the simple Siddeshur’s own words.
      When every one was satisfied that the man had really disappeared, the
      principal performer, who did not seem to be at all astonished, told his
      audience that the vanished man had gone up to the heavens to fight Indra.
      “In a few moments,” says Siddeshur, “he expressed anxiety at the man’s
      continued absence in the aerial regions, and said that he would go up to
      see what was the matter. A boy was called, who held upright a long bamboo,
      up which the man climbed to the top, whereupon we suddenly lost sight of
      him, and the boy laid the bamboo on the ground. Then there fell on the
      ground before us the different members of a human body, all bloody,—first
      one hand, then another, a foot, and so on, until complete. The boy then
      elevated the bamboo, and the principal performer, appearing on the top as
      suddenly as he had disappeared, came down, and seeming quite disconsolate,
      said that Indra had killed his friend before he could get there to save
      him. He then placed the mangled remains in the same box, closed it, and
      tied it as before. Our wonder and astonishment reached their climax when,
      a few minutes later, on the box being again opened, the man jumped out
      perfectly hearty and unhurt.” Is not this rather a severe strain on one’s
      credulity, even for an Indian jugglery story?]</p>

    <p>In Philostratus, again, we may learn the antiquity of some juggling tricks
      that have come up as novelties in our own day. Thus at Taxila a man set his
      son against a board, and then threw darts tracing the outline of the boy’s
      figure on the board. This feat was shown in London some fifteen or twenty
      years ago, and humorously commemorated in <cite>Punch</cite> by John Leech.</p>

      for the sacrifices and for transcription of sacred books, required enormous
      sums. The Lamas enjoyed a preponderating influence, and stood much higher
      than the priests of other creeds, living in the palace as if in their own
      house. The perfumes, which M. Polo mentions, were used by the Lamas for two
      purposes; they used them for joss-sticks, and for making small turrets,
      known under the name of <em>ts’a-ts’a</em>; the joss-sticks used to be burned in
      the same way as they are now; the <em>ts’a-ts’a</em> were inserted in <em>suburgas</em>
      or buried in the ground. At the time when the <em>suburga</em> was built in the
      garden of the Peking palace in 1271, there were used, according to the
      Empress’ wish, 1008 turrets made of the most expensive perfumes, mixed with
      pounded gold, silver, pearls, and corals, and 130,000 <em>ts’a-ts’a</em> made of
      ordinary perfumes.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 29.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI113" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI113" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 13.</a>—There is no exaggeration in this number. Turner speaks of 2500
      monks in one Tibetan convent. Huc mentions Chorchi, north of the Great
      Wall, as containing 2000; and Kúnbúm, where he and Gabet spent several
      months, on the borders of Shensi and Tibet, had nearly 4000. The missionary
      itinerary from Nepal to L’hasa given by Giorgi, speaks of a group of
      convents at a place called Brephung, which formerly contained 10,000
      inmates, and at the time of the journey (about 1700) still contained 5000,
      including attendants. Dr. Campbell gives a list of twelve chief convents
      in L’hasa and its vicinity (not including the Potala or Residence of the
      Grand Lama), of which one is said to have 7500 members, resident and
      itinerary. Major Montgomerie’s Pandit gives the same convent 7700 Lamas. In
      the great monastery at L’hasa called <em>Labrang</em>, they show a copper kettle
      holding more than 100 buckets, which was used to make tea for the Lamas
      who performed the daily temple service. The monasteries are usually, as
      the text says, like small towns, clustered round the great temples. That
      represented at <a href="#i222">p. 224</a> is at Jehol, and is an imitation of the Potala at
      L’hasa. (<cite>Huc’s Tartary</cite>, <i>etc.</i>, pp. 45, 208, etc.; <cite>Alph. Tibetan</cite>, 453;

      from a photograph by M. O. Norzunov; it is interesting to compare it with
      the view given by Kircher in 1670.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[“The monasteries with numbers of monks, who, as M. Polo asserts, behaved
      decently, evidently belonged to Chinese Buddhists, <em>ho-shang</em>; in
      Kúblái’s time they had two monasteries in Shangtu, in the north-east and
      north-west parts of the town.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 29.) Rubruck (<cite>Rockhill’s</cite>
      ed. p. 145) says: “All the priests (of the idolaters) shave their heads,
      and are dressed in saffron colour, and they observe chastity from the
      time they shave their heads, and they live in congregations of one or two
      hundred.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI114" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI114" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 14.</a>—There were many anomalies in the older Lamaism, and it permitted,
      at least in some sects of it which still subsist, the marriage of
      the clergy under certain limitations and conditions. One of Giorgi’s
      missionaries speaks of a Lama of high <em>hereditary</em> rank as a spiritual
      prince who marries, but separates from his wife as soon as he has a son,
      who after certain trials is deemed worthy to be his successor. [“A good
      number of Lamas were married, as M. Polo correctly remarks; their wives
      were known amongst the Chinese, under the name of <em>Fan-sao</em>.” (<em>Ch’ue
      keng lu</em>, quoted by <cite>Palladius</cite>, 28.)—H.&nbsp;C.] One of the “<em>reforms</em>” of
      Tsongkhapa was the absolute prohibition of marriage to the clergy, and
      in this he followed the institutes of the oldest Buddhism. Even the <em>Red
      Lamas</em>, or unreformed, cannot now marry without a dispensation.</p>

    <p>But even the oldest orthodox Buddhism had its Lay brethren and Lay sisters
      (<em>Upásaka</em> and <em>Upásiká</em>), and these are to be found in Tibet and Mongolia
      (<i lang="fr">Voués au blanc</i>, as it were). They are called by the Mongols, by a
      corruption of the Sanskrit, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span><em>Ubashi</em> and <em>Ubashanza</em>. Their vows extend
      to the strict keeping of the five great commandments of the Buddhist Law,
      and they diligently ply the rosary and the prayer-wheel, but they are not
      pledged to celibacy, nor do they adopt the tonsure. As a sign of their
      amphibious position, they commonly wear a red or yellow girdle. These are
      what some travellers speak of as the lowest order of Lamas, permitted to
      marry; and Polo may have regarded them in the same light.</p>

      III. ch. xx.). The name originated in the eleventh century in Lombardy,
      where it came to be applied to the “heretics,” otherwise called “Cathari.”
      Muratori has much on the origin of the name Patarini, and mentions a
      monument, which still exists, in the Piazza de’ Mercanti at Milan, in
      honour of Oldrado Podestà of that city in 1233, and which thus, with more
      pith than grammar, celebrates his meritorious acts:—</p>

    <p><a id="Note_LXI117" href="#NoteAnchor_LXI117" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 17.</a>—Marsden, followed by Pauthier, supposes these unorthodox ascetics
      to be Hindu Sanyasis, and the latter editor supposes even the name <em>Sensi</em>
      or <em>Sensin</em> to represent that denomination. Such wanderers do occasionally
      find their way to Tartary; Gerbillon mentions having encountered five
      of them at Kuku Khotan (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_286">p. 286</a>), and I think John Bell speaks
      of meeting one still further north. But what is said of the great and
      numerous idols of the <em>Sensin</em> is inconsistent with such a notion, as
      is indeed, it seems to me, the whole scope of the passage. Evidently no
      occasional vagabonds from a far country, but some indigenous sectaries,
      are in question. Nor would bran and hot water be a Hindu regimen. The
      staple diet of the Tibetans is <em>Chamba</em>, the meal of toasted barley, mixed
      sometimes with warm water, but more frequently with hot tea, and I think it
      is probable that these were the elements of the ascetic diet rather than
      the mere <em>bran</em> which Polo speaks of. Semedo indeed says that some of the
      Buddhist devotees professed never to take any food but tea; knowing people
      said they mixed with it pellets of sun-dried beef. The determination of the
      sect intended in the text is, I conceive, to be sought in the history of
      Chinese or Tibetan Buddhism and their rivals.</p>

    <p>Both Baldelli and Neumann have indicated a general opinion that the
      <em>Taossé</em> or some branch of that sect is meant, but they have entered into
      no particulars except in a reference by the former to <em>Shien-sien</em>, a title
      of perfection affected by that sect, as the origin of Polo’s term <em>Sensin</em>.
      In the substance of this I think they are right. But I believe that in the
      text this Chinese sect are, rightly or wrongly, identified with the ancient
      Tibetan sect of <em>Bon-po</em>, and that part of the characters assigned belong
      to each.</p>

    <p>First with regard to the <em>Taossé</em>. These were evidently the <em>Patarini</em> of
      the Buddhists in China at this time, and Polo was probably aware of the
      persecution which the latter had stirred up Kúblái to direct against
      them in 1281—persecution at least it is called, though it was but a mild
      proceeding in comparison with the thing contemporaneously practised in
      Christian Lombardy, for in heathen Cathay, books, and not human creatures,
      were the subjects doomed to burn, and even that doom was not carried out.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

    <p>[“The Tao-sze,” says M. Polo, “were looked upon as heretics by the other
      sects; that is, of course, by the Lamas and Ho-shangs; in fact in his time
      a passionate struggle was going on between Buddhists and Tao-sze, or rather
      a persecution of the latter by the former; the Buddhists attributed to the
      doctrine of the Tao-sze a pernicious tendency, and accused them of deceit;
      and in support of these assertions they pointed to some of their sacred
      books. Taking advantage of their influence at Court, they persuaded Kúblái
      to decree the burning of these books, and it was carried out in Peking.”
      (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 30.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The term which Polo writes as <em>Sensin</em> appears to have been that popularly
      applied to the Taossé sect at the Mongol Court. Thus we are told by
      Rashíduddín in his History of Cathay: “In the reign of Din-Wang, the 20th
      king of this (the 11th) Dynasty, <span class="smcap">Tai Shang Lái Kún</span>, was born. This person
      is stated to have been accounted a prophet by the people of Khitá; his
      father’s name was Hán; like Shák-múni he is said to have been conceived
      by light, and it is related that his mother bore him in her womb no less
      a period than 80 years. The people who embraced his doctrine were called
      <span lang="ar">شن شن</span> (<em>Shăn-shăn</em> or <em>Shinshin</em>).” This is a correct epitome of the
      Chinese story of <em>Laokiun</em> or <em>Lao-tsé</em>, born in the reign of <em>Ting Wang</em>
      of the Cheu Dynasty. The whole title used by Rashíduddín, <em>Tai Shang Lao
      Kiun</em>, “The Great Supreme Venerable Ruler,” is that formerly applied by the
      Chinese to this philosopher.</p>

    <p>Further, in a Mongol [and Chinese] inscription of the year 1314 from the
      department of Si-ngan fu, which has been interpreted and published by Mr.
      Wylie, the Taossé priests are termed <em>Senshing</em>. [See <cite>Devéria, Notes
      d’Épigraphie</cite>, pp. 39–43, and Prince <cite>R. Bonaparte’s Recueil</cite>, Pl. xii. No.
      3.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Seeing then that the very term used by Polo is that applied by both Mongol
      and Persian authorities of the period to the Taossé, we can have no doubt
      that the latter are indicated, whether the facts stated about them be
      correct or not.</p>

    <p>The word Senshing-ud (the Mongol plural) is represented in the Chinese
      version of Mr. Wylie’s inscription by <em>Sín-săng</em>, a conventional title
      applied to literary men, and this perhaps is sufficient to determine the
      Chinese word which <em>Sensin</em> represents. I should otherwise have supposed
      it to be the <em>Shin-sian</em> alluded to by Baldelli, and mentioned in the
      quotations which follow; and indeed it seems highly probable that two
      terms so much alike should have been confounded by foreigners. Semedo
      says of the Taossé: “They pretend that by means of certain exercises and
      meditations one shall regain his youth, and others shall attain to be
      <em>Shien-sien</em>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘Terrestrial Beati,’ in whose state every desire is
      gratified, whilst they have the power to transport themselves from one
      place to another, however distant, with speed and facility.” Schott, on the
      same subject, says: “By <em>Sian</em> or <em>Shin-sian</em> are understood in the old
      Chinese conception, and particularly in that of the Tao-Kiao [or Taossé]
      sect, persons who withdraw to the hills to lead the life of anchorites,
      and who have attained, either through their ascetic observances or by the
      power of charms and elixirs, to the possession of miraculous gifts and of
      terrestrial immortality.” And M. Pauthier himself, in his translation of
      the Journey of Khieu, an eminent doctor of this sect, to the camp of the
      Great Chinghiz in Turkestan, has related how Chinghiz bestowed upon this
      personage “a seal with a tiger’s head and a diploma” (surely a lion’s head,
      <em>P’aizah</em> and <em>Yarligh</em>; see <i>infra</i>, <a href="#Note_VII22">Bk. II. ch. vii. note 2</a>), “wherein he
      was styled <em>Shin Sien</em> or Divine Anchorite.” <em>Sian-jin</em> again is the word
      used by Hiuen Tsang as the equivalent to the name of the Indian <em>Rishis</em>,
      who attain to supernatural powers.</p>

    <p>[“<em>Sensin</em> is a sufficiently faithful transcription of <em>Sien-seng</em>
      (Sien-shing in Pekingese); the name given by the Mongols in conversation as
      well as in official documents, to the Tao-sze, in the sense of preceptors,
      just as Lamas were called by them <em>Bacshi</em>, which corresponds to the
      Chinese <em>Sien-seng</em>. M. Polo calls them fasters and ascetics. It was one
      of the sects of Taouism. There was another one which practised cabalistic
      and other mysteries. The Tao-sze had two monasteries in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>Shangtu, one in the
      eastern, the other in the western part of the town.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 30.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>One class of the Tao priests or devotees does marry, but another class
      never does. Many of them lead a wandering life, and derive a precarious
      subsistence from the sale of charms and medical nostrums. They shave the
      sides of the head, and coil the remaining hair in a tuft on the crown, in
      the ancient Chinese manner; moreover, says Williams, they “<em>are recognised
      by their slate-coloured robes</em>.” On the feast of one of their divinities
      whose title Williams translates as “High Emperor of the Sombre Heavens,”
      they assemble before his temple, “and having made a great fire, about 15
      or 20 feet in diameter, go over it barefoot, preceded by the priests and
      bearing the gods in their arms. They firmly assert that if they possess a
      sincere mind they will not be injured by the fire; but both priests and
      people get miserably burnt on these occasions.” Escayrac de Lauture says
      that on those days they leap, dance, and whirl round the fire, striking
      at the devils with a straight Roman-like sword, and sometimes wounding
      themselves as the priests of Baal and Moloch used to do.</p>

    <p>Let us now turn to the <em>Bon-po</em>. Of this form of religion and its sectaries
      not much is known, for it is now confined to the eastern and least known
      part of Tibet. It is, however, believed to be a remnant of the old
      pre-Buddhistic worship of the powers of nature, though much modified by the
      Buddhistic worship with which it has so long been in contact. Mr. Hodgson
      also pronounces a collection of drawings of Bonpo divinities, which were
      made for him by a mendicant friar of the sect from the neighbourhood of
      Tachindu, or Ta-t’sien-lu, to be saturated with <em>Sakta</em> attributes, <i>i.e.</i>
      with the spirit of the Tantrika worship, a worship which he tersely defines
      as “a mixture of lust, ferocity, and mummery,” and which he believes to
      have originated in an incorporation with the Indian religions of the rude
      superstitions of the primitive Turanians. Mr. Hodgson was told that the
      Bonpo sect still possessed numerous and wealthy Vihars (or abbeys) in
      Tibet. But from the information of the Catholic missionaries in Eastern
      Tibet, who have come into closest contact with the sect, it appears to
      be now in a state of great decadence, “oppressed by the Lamas of other
      sects, the <em>Peunbo</em> (Bonpo) think only of shaking off the yoke, and getting
      deliverance from the vexations which the smallness of their number forces
      them to endure.” In June, 1863, apparently from such despairing motives,
      the Lamas of Tsodam, a Bonpo convent in the vicinity of the mission
      settlement of Bonga in E. Tibet, invited the Rev. Gabriel Durand to come
      and instruct them. “In this temple,” he writes, “are the <em>monstrous idols</em>
      of the sect of Peunbo; horrid figures, whose features only Satan could
      have inspired. They are disposed about the enclosure according to their
      power and their seniority. Above the pagoda is a loft, the nooks of which
      are crammed with all kinds of diabolical trumpery; little idols of wood or
      copper, hideous masques of men and animals, superstitious Lama vestments,
      drums, trumpets of human bones, sacrificial vessels, in short, all the
      utensils with which the devil’s servants in Tibet honour their master. And
      what will become of it all? The Great River, whose waves roll to Martaban
      (the Lu-kiang or Salwen), is not more than 200 or 300 paces distant....
      Besides the infernal paintings on the walls, eight or nine monstrous idols,
      seated at the inner end of the pagoda, were calculated by their size and
      aspect to inspire awe. In the middle was <em>Tamba-Shi-Rob</em>, the great doctor
      of the sect of the Peunbo, squatted with his right arm outside his red
      scarf, and holding in his left the vase of knowledge.... On his right
      hand sat <em>Keumta-Zon-bo</em>, ‘the All-Good,’ ... with ten hands and three
      heads, one over the other.... At his right is <em>Dreuma</em>, the most celebrated
      goddess of the sect. On the left of Tamba-Shi-Rob was another goddess,
      whose name they never could tell me. On the left again of this anonymous
      goddess appeared <em>Tam-pla-mi-ber</em>, ... a monstrous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>dwarf environed by flames
      and his head garnished with a diadem of skulls. <em>He trod with one foot
      on the head of Shakia-tupa</em> [<em>Shakya Thubba</em>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘the Mighty Shakya,’
      the usual Tibetan appellation of Sakya Buddha himself].... The idols are
      made of a coarse composition of mud and stalks kneaded together, on which
      they put first a coat of plaster and then various colours, or even silver
      or gold.... <em>Four oxen would scarcely have been able to draw one of the
      idols</em>.” Mr. Emilius Schlagintweit, in a paper on the subject of this sect,
      has explained some of the names used by the missionary. <em>Tamba-Shi-Rob</em> is
      “<em>bs</em>tanpa <em>g</em>Shen-rabs,” <i>i.e.</i> the doctrine of Shen-rabs, who is regarded
      as the founder of the Bon religion. [Cf. <cite>Grenard</cite>, II. 407.—H.&nbsp;C.]
      <em>Keun-tu-zon-bo</em> is “Kun-tu-<em>b</em>zang-po,” “<em>the All Best</em>.”</p>

    <p>[<em>Bon-po</em> seems to be (according to Grenard, II. 410) a “coarse naturism
      combined with ancestral worship” resembling Taoism. It has, however,
      borrowed a good deal from Buddhism. “I noticed,” says Mr. Rockhill
      (<cite>Journey</cite>, 86), “a couple of grimy volumes of Bönbo sacred literature. One
      of them I examined; it was a funeral service, and was in the usual Bönbo
      jargon, three-fourths Buddhistic in its nomenclature.” The Bon-po Lamas are
      above all sorcerers and necromancers, and are very similar to the <em>kam</em> of
      the Northern Turks, the <em>bô</em> of the Mongols, and lastly to the <em>Shamans</em>.
      During their operations, they wear a tall pointed black hat, surmounted by
      the feather of a peacock, or of a cock, and a human skull. Their principal
      divinities are the White God of Heaven, the Black Goddess of Earth, the
      Red Tiger and the Dragon; they worship an idol called <em>Kye’-p’ang</em> formed
      of a mere block of wood covered with garments. Their sacred symbol is the
      <em>svastika</em> turned from right to left <span class="xxlarge iglyph-b">卍</span>. The most important of their
      monasteries is Zo-chen gum-pa, in the north-east of Tibet, where they
      print most of their books. The Bonpos Lamas “are very popular with the
      agricultural Tibetans, but not so much so with the pastoral tribes, who
      nearly all belong to the Gélupa sect of the orthodox Buddhist Church.” A.
      K. says, “Buddhism is the religion of the country; there are two sects,
      one named Mangba and the other Chiba or Baimbu.” <cite>Explorations made by
      A—— K——</cite>, 34. <em>Mangba</em> means “Esoteric,” <em>Chiba</em> (<em>p’yi-ba</em>), “Exoteric,”
      and <em>Baimbu</em> is Bönbo. <cite>Rockhill, Journey</cite>, 289, <cite>et passim.; Land of the
      Lamas</cite>, 217–218; <cite>Grenard, Mission Scientifique</cite>, II. 407 <i>seqq.</i>—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>There is an indication in Koeppen’s references that the followers of the
      <em>Bon</em> doctrine are sometimes called in Tibet <em>Nag-choi</em>, or “Black Sect,”
      as the old and the reformed Lamas are called respectively the “Red” and the
      “Yellow.” If so, it is reasonable to conclude that the first appellation,
      like the two last, has a reference to the colour of clothing affected by
      the priesthood.</p>

    <p>The Rev. Mr. Jaeschke writes from Lahaul: “There are no Bonpos in our part
      of the country, and as far as we know there cannot be many of them in the
      whole of Western Tibet, <i>i.e.</i> in Ladak, Spiti, and all the non-Chinese
      provinces together; we know, therefore, not much more of them than has
      been made known to the European public by different writers on Buddhism in
      Tibet, and lately collected by Emil de Schlagintweit.... Whether they can
      be with certainty identified with the Chinese <em>Taossé</em> I cannot decide,
      as I don’t know if anything like historical evidence about their Chinese
      origin has been detected anywhere, or if it is merely a conclusion from
      the similarity of their doctrines and practices.... But the Chinese author
      of the <em>Wei-tsang-tu-Shi</em>, translated by Klaproth, under the title of
      <cite>Description du Tubet</cite> (Paris, 1831), renders <em>Bonpo</em> by <em>Taossé</em>. So much
      seems to be certain that it was the ancient religion of Tibet, before
      Buddhism penetrated into the country, and that even at later periods
      it several times gained the ascendancy when the secular power was of a
      disposition averse to the Lamaitic hierarchy. Another opinion is that the
      Bon religion was originally a mere fetishism, and related to or identical
      with Shamanism; this appears to me very probable and easy to reconcile with
      the former supposition, for it may afterwards, on becoming acquainted with
      the Chinese doctrine of the ‘Taossé,’ have adorned itself with many of its
      tenets.... With regard to the following particulars, I have got most of my
      information from our Lama, a native of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>the neighbourhood of Tashi Lhunpo,
      whom we consulted about all your questions. The extraordinary asceticism
      which struck Marco Polo so much is of course not to be understood as being
      practised by all members of the sect, but exclusively, or more especially,
      by the <em>priests</em>. That these <em>never</em> marry, and are consequently more
      strictly celibatary than many sects of the Lamaitic priesthood, was
      confirmed by our Lama.” (Mr. Jaeschke then remarks upon the <em>bran</em> to much
      the same effect as I have done above.) “The Bonpos are by all Buddhists
      regarded as heretics. Though they worship idols partly the same, at least
      in name, with those of the Buddhists, ... their rites seem to be very
      different. The most conspicuous and most generally known of their customs,
      futile in itself, but in the eyes of the common people the greatest sign of
      their sinful heresy, is that they perform the religious ceremony of making
      a turn round a sacred object <em>in the opposite direction</em> to that prescribed
      by Buddhism. As to their dress, our Lama said that they had no particular
      colour of garments, but their priests frequently wore red clothes, as some
      sects of the Buddhist priesthood do. Mr. Heyde, however, once on a journey
      in our neighbouring county of Langskar, saw a man <em>clothed in black with
      blue borders</em>, who the people said was a <em>Bonpo</em>.”</p>

    <p>[Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Journey </cite>, 63) saw at Kao miao-tzŭ “a <em>red</em>-gowned,
      long-haired Bönbo Lama,” and at Kumbum (p. 68), “was surprised to see quite
      a large number of Bönbo Lamas, recognisable by their huge mops of hair and
      their <em>red</em> gowns, and also from their being dirtier than the ordinary run
      of people.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The identity of the Bonpo and Taossé seems to have been accepted by Csoma
      de Körös, who identifies the Chinese founder of the latter, Lao-tseu, with
      the Shen-rabs of the Tibetan Bonpos. Klaproth also says, “Bhonbp’o, Bhanpo,
      and <em>Shen</em>, are the names by which are commonly designated (in Tibetan) the
      Taoszu, or followers of the Chinese philosopher Laotseu.”<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Schlagintweit
      refers to Schmidt’s Tibetan Grammar (p. 209) and to the Calcutta edition of
      the <cite>Fo-kouè-ki</cite> (p. 218) for the like identification, but I do not know
      how far any two of these are independent testimonies. General Cunningham,
      however, fully accepts the identity, and writes to me: “Fahian (ch.
      xxiii.) calls the heretics who assembled at Râmagrâma <em>Taossé</em>,<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> thus
      identifying them with the Chinese Finitimists. The Taossé are, therefore,
      the same as the <em>Swâstikas</em>, or worshippers of the mystic cross <em>Swasti</em>,
      who are also <em>Tirthakaras</em>, or ‘Pure-doers.’ The synonymous word <em>Punya</em>
      is probably the origin of <em>Pon</em> or <em>Bon</em>, the Tibetan Finitimists. From
      the same word comes the Burmese <em>P’ungyi</em> or <em>Pungi</em>.” I may add that the
      Chinese envoy to Cambodia in 1296, whose narrative Rémusat has translated,
      describes a sect which he encountered there, apparently Brahminical, as
      <em>Taossé</em>. And even if the Bonpo and the Taossé were not fundamentally
      identical, it is extremely probable that the Tibetan and Mongol Buddhists
      should have applied to them one name and character. Each played towards
      them the same part in Tibet and in China respectively; both were heretic
      sects and hated rivals; both made high pretensions to asceticism and
      supernatural powers; both, I think we see reason to believe, affected the
      dark clothing which Polo assigns to the <em>Sensin</em>; both, we may add, had
      “great idols and plenty of them.” We have seen in the account of the Taossé
      the ground that certain of their ceremonies afford for the allegation
      that they “sometimes also worship fire,” whilst the whole account of
      that rite and of others mentioned by Duhalde,<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> shows what a powerful
      element of the old devil-dancing Shamanism there is in their practice.
      The French Jesuit, on the other hand, shows us what a prominent place
      female <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>divinities occupied in the Bon-po Pantheon,<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> though we cannot
      say of either sect that “their idols are all feminine.” A strong symptom
      of relation between the two religions, by the way, occurs in M. Durand’s
      account of the Bon Temple. We see there that <em>Shen-rabs</em>, the great doctor
      of the sect, occupies a chief and central place among the idols. Now in
      the Chinese temples of the Taossé the figure of <em>their</em> Doctor <em>Lao-tseu</em>
      is one member of the triad called the “Three Pure Ones,” which constitute
      the chief objects of worship. This very title recalls General Cunningham’s
      etymology of Bonpo.</p>

      18.</a>—Pauthier’s text has <em>blons</em>, no doubt an error for <em>blous</em>. In
      the G. Text it is <em>bloies</em>. Pauthier interprets the latter term as “blond
      ardent,” whilst the glossary to the G. Text explains it as both <em>blue</em> and
      <em>white</em>. <cite>Raynouard’s Romance Dict.</cite> explains <em>Bloi</em> as “Blond.” Ramusio
      has <em>biave</em>, and I have no doubt that <em>blue</em> is the meaning. The same word
      (<em>bloie</em>) is used in the G. Text, where Polo speaks of the bright colours
      of the Palace tiles at Cambaluc, and where Pauthier’s text has “<em>vermeil
      et jaune et vert</em> et blou,” and again (<i>infra</i>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XIX2">Bk. II. ch. xix.</a>), where the
      two corps of huntsmen are said to be clad respectively in <em>vermeil</em> and
      in <em>bloie</em>. Here, again, Pauthier’s text has <em>bleu</em>. The Crusca in the
      description of the <em>Sensin</em> omits the colours altogether; in the two other
      passages referred to it has <em>bioda, biodo</em>.</p>

      are <em>Tow Mu</em> (the ‘Ursa major,’ constellation), <em>Pi-hia-yuen Kiun</em> (the

      diseases of the eyes; and others, which are to be seen everywhere. The
      Tao-sze have, besides these, a good number of male divinities, bearing the

      Kúblái’s superiority. On his deathbed he said: “The words of the lad Kúblái
      are well worth attention; see, all of you, that ye heed what he says! One
      day he will sit in my seat and bring you good fortune such as you have had

      frontiers of this country (’Irák) to the Centre of Empire, the Focus of
      the Universe, the genial abode of the ever-Fortunate Emperor and Just
      Kaan, is a whole year’s journey, yet the stories that have been spread
      abroad, even in these parts, of his glorious deeds, his institutes, his
      decisions, his justice, the largeness and acuteness of his intellect,
      his correctness of judgment, his great powers of administration, from
      the mouths of credible witnesses, of well-known merchants and eminent
      travellers, are so surpassing, that one beam of his glories, one fraction
      of his great qualities, suffices to eclipse all that history tells of the
      Cæsars of Rome, of the Chosroes of Persia, of the Khagans of China, of
      the (Himyarite) Kails of Arabia, of the Tobbas of Yemen, and the Rajas

    sixth Lord in that succession, as I have already told you in this book.
    He came to the throne in the year of Christ, 1256, and the Empire fell
    to him because of his ability and valour and great worth, as was right
    and reason.<a id="NoteAnchor_II21" href="#Note_II21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> His brothers, indeed, and other kinsmen disputed his
    claim, but his it remained, both because maintained by his great valour,
    and because it was in law and right his, as being directly sprung of the
    imperial line.</p>

  <p>Up to the year of Christ now running, to wit 1298, he hath reigned
    two-and-forty years, and his age is about eighty-five, so that he must have
    been about forty-three years of age when he first came to the throne.<a id="NoteAnchor_II22" href="#Note_II22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    Before that time he had often been to the wars, and had shown himself a
    gallant soldier and an <span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>excellent captain. But after coming to the throne he
    never went to the wars in person save once.<a id="NoteAnchor_II23" href="#Note_II23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> This befel in the year
    of Christ, 1286, and I will tell you why he went.</p>

  <p>There was a great Tartar Chief, whose name was <span class="smcap">Nayan</span>,<a id="NoteAnchor_II24" href="#Note_II24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> a young man
    [of thirty], Lord over many lands and many provinces; and he was Uncle to
    the Emperor Cublay Kaan of whom we are speaking. And when he found himself
    in authority this Nayan waxed proud in the insolence of his youth and his
    great power; for indeed he could bring into the field 300,000 horsemen,
    though all the time he was liegeman to his nephew, the Great Kaan Cublay,
    as was right and reason. Seeing then what great power he had, he took it
    into his head that he would be the Great Kaan’s vassal no longer; nay more,
    he would fain wrest his empire from him if he could. So this Nayan sent
    envoys to another Tartar Prince called <span class="smcap">Caidu</span>, also a great and potent Lord,
    who was a kinsman of his, and who was a nephew of the Great Kaan and his
    lawful liegeman also, though he was in rebellion and at bitter enmity with
    his sovereign Lord and Uncle. Now the message that Nayan sent was this:
    That he himself was making ready to march against the Great Kaan with all
    his forces (which were great), and he begged Caidu to do likewise from his
    side, so that by attacking Cublay on two sides at once with such great
    forces they would be able to wrest his dominion from him.</p>

  <p>And when Caidu heard the message of Nayan, he was right glad thereat,
    and thought the time was come at last to gain his object. So he sent
    back answer that he would do as requested; and got ready his host, which
    mustered a good hundred thousand horsemen.</p>

  <p>Now let us go back to the Great Kaan, who had news of all this plot.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span></p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_II21" href="#NoteAnchor_II21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—There is no doubt that Kúblái was proclaimed Kaan in 1260 (4th
      month), his brother Mangku Kaan having perished during the seige of Hochau
      in Szechwan in August of the preceding year. But Kúblái had come into
      Cathay some years before as his brother’s Lieutenant.</p>

    <p>He was the <em>fifth</em>, not sixth, Supreme Kaan, as we have already noticed.
      (<a href="#Note_LI12">Bk. I. ch. li. note 2</a>.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_II22" href="#NoteAnchor_II22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—Kúblái was born in the eighth month of the year corresponding
      to 1216, and had he lived to 1298 would have been eighty-two years old.
      [According to Dr. E. Bretschneider (<cite>Peking</cite>, 30), quoting the <cite>Yuen-Shi</cite>,
      Kúblái died at Khanbaligh, in the Tze-t’an tien in February, 1294.—H.&nbsp;C.]
      But by Mahomedan reckoning he would have been close upon eighty-five. He
      was the fourth son of Tuli, who was the youngest of Chinghiz’s four sons by
      his favourite wife Burté Fujin. (See <cite>De Mailla</cite>, IX. 255, etc.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_II23" href="#NoteAnchor_II23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—This is not literally true; for soon after his accession (in 1261)
      Kúblái led an army against his brother and rival Arikbuga, and defeated
      him. And again in his old age, if we credit the Chinese annalist, in 1289,
      when his grandson Kanmala (or Kambala) was beaten on the northern frontier
      by Kaidu, Kúblái took the field himself, though on his approach the rebels
      disappeared.</p>

    <p>Kúblái and his brother Hulaku, young as they were, commenced their military
      career on Chinghiz’s last expedition (1226–1227). His most notable campaign
      was the conquest of Yunnan in 1253–1254. (<cite>De Mailla</cite>, IX. 298, 441.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_II24" href="#NoteAnchor_II24" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—<span class="smcap">Nayan</span> was no “uncle” of Kúblái’s, but a cousin in a junior
      generation. For Kúblái was the grandson of Chinghiz, and Nayan was the
      great-great-grandson of Chinghiz’s brother Uchegin, called in the Chinese
      annals Pilgutai. [Belgutai was Chinghiz’s step-brother. (<cite>Palladius</cite>.)—H.&nbsp;C.]
      On this brother, the great-uncle of Kúblái, and the commander of the
      latter’s forces against Arikbuga in the beginning of the reign, both
      Chinghiz and Kúblái had bestowed large territories in Eastern Tartary
      towards the frontier of Corea, and north of Liaotong towards the Manchu
      country. [“The situation and limits of his appanage are not clearly defined
      in history. According to Belgutai’s biography, it was between the Onon and
      Kerulen (<cite>Yuen shi</cite>), and according to Shin Yao’s researches (<em>Lo fung low
      wen kao</em>), at the confluence of the Argun and Shilka. Finally, according
      to Harabadur’s biography, it was situated in Abalahu, which geographically
      and etymologically corresponds to modern Butkha (<cite>Yuen shi</cite>); Abalahu,
      as Kúblái himself said, was rich in fish; indeed, after the suppression
      of Nayan’s rebellion, the governor of that country used to send to the
      Peking Court fishes weighing up to a thousand Chinese pounds (<em>kin</em>.). It
      was evidently a country near the Amur River.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> 31.)—H.&nbsp;C.]
      Nayan had added to his inherited territory, and become very powerful.
      [“History has apparently connected Nayan’s appanage with that of Hatan
      (a grandson of Hachiun, brother of Chinghiz Khan), whose <em>ordo</em> was
      contiguous to Nayan’s, on the left bank of the Amur, hypothetically east
      of Blagovietschensk, on the spot, where still the traces of an ancient
      city can be seen. Nayan’s possessions stretched south to Kwang-ning, which
      belonged to his appanage, and it was from this town that he had the title
      of prince of Kwang-ning (<cite>Yuen shi</cite>).” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> 31.)—H.&nbsp;C.]
      Kaidu had gained influence over Nayan, and persuaded him to rise against
      Kúblái. A number of the other Mongol princes took part with him. Kúblái
      was much disquieted at the rumours, and sent his great lieutenant <span class="smcap">Bayan</span> to
      reconnoitre. Bayan was nearly captured, but escaped to court and reported
      to his master the great armament that Nayan was preparing. Kúblái succeeded
      by diplomacy in detaching some of the princes from the enterprise, and
      resolved to march in person to the scene of action, whilst despatching
      Bayan to the Karakorum frontier to intercept Kaidu. This was in the summer
      of 1287. What followed will be found in a subsequent note (<a href="#Note_IV22">ch. iv. note 6</a>).

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_III2"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER III</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">How the Great Kaan marched against Nayan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Great Kaan heard what was afoot, he made his preparations in right
    good heart, like one who feared not the issue of an attempt so contrary
    to justice. Confident in his own conduct and prowess, he was in no degree
    disturbed, but vowed that he would never wear crown again if he brought not
    those two traitorous and disloyal Tartar chiefs to an ill end. So swiftly
    and secretly were his preparations made, that no one knew of them but his
    Privy Council, and all were completed within ten or twelve days. In that
    time he had assembled good 360,000 horsemen, and 100,000 footmen,—but a
    small force indeed for him, and consisting only of those that were in the
    vicinity. For the rest of his vast and innumerable forces were too far
    off to answer so hasty a summons, being engaged under orders from him on
    distant expeditions to conquer divers countries and provinces. If he had
    waited to summon all his troops, the multitude assembled would have been
    beyond all belief, a multitude such as never was heard of or told of,
    past all counting. In fact, those 360,000 horsemen that he got together
    consisted merely of the falconers and whippers-in that were about the
    court!<a id="NoteAnchor_III21" href="#Note_III21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>And when he had got ready this handful (as it were) of his troops, he
    ordered his astrologers to declare whether he should gain the battle and
    get the better of his enemies. After they had made their observations, they
    told him to go on boldly, for he would conquer and gain a glorious victory:
    whereat he greatly rejoiced.</p>

  <p>So he marched with his army, and after advancing for 20 days they arrived
    at a great plain where Nayan lay with all his host, amounting to some
    400,000 horse. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>Now the Great Kaan’s forces arrived so fast and so suddenly
    that the others knew nothing of the matter. For the Kaan had caused such
    strict watch to be made in every direction for scouts that every one that
    appeared was instantly captured. Thus Nayan had no warning of his coming
    and was completely taken by surprise; insomuch that when the Great Kaan’s
    army came up, he was asleep in the arms of a wife of his of whom he was
    extravagantly fond. So thus you see why it was that the Emperor equipped
    his force with such speed and secrecy.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_III21" href="#NoteAnchor_III21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—I am afraid Marco, in his desire to impress on his readers the
      great power of the Kaan, is here giving the reins to exaggeration on a
      great scale.</p>

    <p>Ramusio has here the following explanatory addition:—“You must know
      that in all the Provinces of Cathay and Mangi, and throughout the Great
      Kaan’s dominions, there are too many disloyal folk ready to break into
      rebellion against their Lord, and hence it is needful in every province
      containing large cities and much population, to maintain garrisons. These
      are stationed four or five miles from the cities, and the latter are not
      allowed to have walls or gates by which they might obstruct the entrance of
      the troops at their pleasure. These garrisons as well as their commanders
      the Great Kaan causes to be relieved every two years; and bridled in this
      way the people are kept quiet, and can make no disturbance. The troops
      are maintained not only by the pay which the Kaan regularly assigns from
      the revenues of each province, but also by the vast quantities of cattle
      which they keep, and by the sale of milk in the cities, which furnishes the
      means of buying what they require. They are scattered among their different
      stations, at distances of 30, 40, or 60 days (from the capital); and had
      Cublay decided to summon but the half of them, the number would have been
      incredible,” etc.</p>

    <p>[Palladius says (p. 37) that in the Mongol-Chinese documents, the Mongol
      garrisons cantoned near the Chinese towns are mentioned under the name of
      <em>Aolu</em>, but no explanation of the term is given.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The system of controlling garrisons, quartered at a few miles from the
      great cities, is that which the Chinese followed at Kashgar, Yarkand,
      etc. It is, in fact, our own system in India, as at Barrackpúr, Dinapúr,
      Sikandarábád, Mián Mír.</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_IV2"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER IV</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Battle that the Great Kaan fought with Nayan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">What</span> shall I say about it? When day had well broken, there was the Kaan
    with all his host upon a hill overlooking the plain where Nayan lay in his
    tent, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>in all security, without the slightest thought of any one coming
    thither to do him hurt. In fact, this confidence of his was such that
    he kept no vedettes whether in front or in rear; for he knew nothing of
    the coming of the Great Kaan, owing to all the approaches having been
    completely occupied as I told you. Moreover, the place was in a remote
    wilderness, more than thirty marches from the Court, though the Kaan had
    made the distance in twenty, so eager was he to come to battle with Nayan.</p>

  <p>And what shall I tell you next? The Kaan was there on the hill, mounted
    on a great wooden bartizan,<a id="NoteAnchor_IV21" href="#Note_IV21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> which was borne by four well-trained
    elephants, and over him was hoisted his standard, so high aloft that it
    could be seen from all sides. His troops were ordered in battles of 30,000
    men apiece; and a great part of the horsemen had each a foot-soldier armed
    with a lance set on the crupper behind him (for it was thus that the
    footmen were disposed of);<a id="NoteAnchor_IV22" href="#Note_IV22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> and the whole plain seemed to be covered
    with his forces. So it was thus that the Great Kaan’s army was arrayed for battle.</p>

  <p>When Nayan and his people saw what had happened, they were sorely
    confounded, and rushed in haste to arms. Nevertheless they made them ready
    in good style and formed their troops in an orderly manner. And when all
    were in battle array on both sides as I have told you, and nothing remained
    but to fall to blows, then might you have heard a sound arise of many
    instruments of various music, and of the voices of the whole of the two
    hosts loudly singing. For this is a custom of the Tartars, that before they
    join battle they all unite in singing and playing on a certain two-stringed
    instrument of theirs, a thing right pleasant to hear. And so they continue
    in their array of battle, singing and playing in this pleasing manner,
    until the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>great Naccara of the Prince is heard to sound. As soon as that
    begins to sound the fight also begins on both sides; and in no case before
    the Prince’s Naccara sounds dare any commence fighting.<a id="NoteAnchor_IV23" href="#Note_IV23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>So then, as they were thus singing and playing, though ordered and ready
    for battle, the great Naccara of the Great Khan began to sound. And that
    of Nayan also began to sound. And thenceforward the din of battle began to
    be heard loudly from this side and from that. And they rushed to work so
    doughtily with their bows and their maces, with their lances and swords,
    and with the arblasts of the footmen, that it was a wondrous sight to see.
    Now might you behold such flights of arrows from this side and from that,
    that the whole heaven was canopied with them and they fell like rain. Now
    might you see on this side and on that full many a cavalier and man-at-arms
    fall slain, insomuch that the whole field seemed covered with them.
    From this side and from that such cries arose from the crowds of the
    wounded and dying that had God thundered, you would not have heard Him! For
    fierce and furious was the battle, and quarter there was none given.<a id="NoteAnchor_IV24" href="#Note_IV24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>But why should I make a long story of it? You must know that it was the
    most parlous and fierce and fearful battle that ever has been fought in our
    day. Nor have there ever been such forces in the field in actual fight,
    especially of horsemen, as were then engaged—for, taking both sides, there
    were not fewer than 760,000 horsemen, a mighty force! and that without
    reckoning the footmen, who were also very numerous. The battle endured with
    various fortune on this side and on that from morning till noon. But at
    the last, by God’s pleasure and the right that was on his side, the Great
    Khan had the victory, and Nayan <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>lost the battle and was utterly routed. For
    the army of the Great Kaan performed such feats of arms that Nayan and his
    host could stand against them no longer, so they turned and fled. But this
    availed nothing for Nayan; for he and all the barons with him were taken
    prisoners, and had to surrender to the Kaan with all their arms.</p>

  <p>Now you must know that Nayan was a baptized Christian, and bore the cross
    on his banner; but this nought availed him, seeing how grievously he had
    done amiss in rebelling against his Lord. For he was the Great Kaan’s
    liegeman,<a id="NoteAnchor_IV25" href="#Note_IV25" class="fnanchor">{5}</a> and was bound to hold his lands of him like all his
    ancestors before him.<a id="NoteAnchor_IV26" href="#Note_IV26" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

      1.</a>—“<em>Une grande</em> bretesche.” <em>Bretesche, Bertisca</em> (whence old English
      <em>Brattice</em>, and <em>Bartizan</em>), was a term applied to any boarded structure of
      defence or attack, but especially to the timber parapets and roofs often
      placed on the top of the flanking-towers in mediæval fortifications; and
      this use quite explains the sort of structure here intended. The term and
      its derivative <em>Bartizan</em> came later to be applied to projecting <em>guérites</em>
      or watch-towers of masonry. <em>Brattice</em> in English is now applied to a
      fence round a pit or dangerous machinery. (See <cite>Muratori</cite>, <cite>Dissert.</cite> I.

      Dict.</cite>)</p>

    <p>[John Ranking (<cite>Hist. Res. on the Wars and Sports of the Mongols and
      Romans</cite>) in a note regarding this battle writes (p. 60): “It appears that
      it is an old custom in Persia, to use four elephants a-breast.” The Senate
      decreed Gordian III. to represent him triumphing after the Persian mode,
      with chariots drawn with four elephants. <cite>Augustan Hist.</cite> vol. ii. p. 65.
      See plate, p. 52.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_IV22" href="#NoteAnchor_IV22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—This circumstance is mentioned in the extract below from Gaubil. He
      <em>may</em> have taken it from Polo, as it is not in Pauthier’s Chinese extracts;
      but Gaubil has other facts not noticed in these.</p>

    <p>[Elephants came from the Indo-Chinese Kingdoms, Burma, Siam, Champa.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_IV23" href="#NoteAnchor_IV23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The specification of the Tartar instrument of two strings is
      peculiar to Pauthier’s texts. It was no doubt what Dr. Clarke calls “the
      <em>balalaika</em> or two-stringed lyre,” the most common instrument among the Kalmaks.</p>

    <p>The sounding of the Nakkára as the signal of action is an old Pan-Asiatic
      custom, but I cannot find that this very striking circumstance of the whole
      host of Tartars playing and singing in chorus, when ordered for battle and
      waiting the signal from the boom of the Big Drum, is mentioned by any other author.</p>

    <p>The <em>Naḳḳárah</em> or <em>Nagárah</em> was a great kettledrum, formed like a brazen
      caldron, tapering to the bottom and covered with buffalo-hide—at least 3½
      or 4 feet in diameter. Bernier, indeed, tells of <em>Naḳḳáras</em> in use at the
      Court of Delhi that were not less than a fathom across; and Tod speaks of
      them in Rájpútána as “about 8 or 10 feet in diameter.” The Tartar Naḳḳárahs
      were usually, I presume, carried on a camel; but as Kúblái had begun to
      use elephants, his may have been carried on an <span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>elephant, as is sometimes
      the case in India. Thus, too, P. della Valle describes those of an Indian
      Embassy at Ispahan: “The Indian Ambassador was also accompanied by a
      variety of warlike instruments of music of strange kinds, and particularly
      by certain Naccheras of such immense size that each pair had an elephant
      to carry them, whilst an Indian astride upon the elephant between the
      two Naccheras played upon them with both hands, dealing strong blows on
      this one and on that; what a din was made by these vast drums, and what a
      spectacle it was, I leave you to imagine.”</p>

    <p>Joinville also speaks of the Nakkara as the signal for action: “So he
      was setting his host in array till noon, and then he made those drums of
      theirs to sound that they call <em>Nacaires</em>, and then they set upon us horse
      and foot.” The Great Nakkara of the Tartars appears from several Oriental
      histories to have been called <em>Ḳúrḳah</em>. I cannot find this word in any
      dictionary accessible to me, but it is in the <cite>Ain Akbari</cite> (<cite>Kawargah</cite>) as
      distinct from the <em>Naḳḳárah</em>. Abulfazl tells us that Akbar not only had
      a rare knowledge of the science of music, but was likewise an excellent
      performer—especially on the <em>Naḳḳárah!</em></p>

    <div class="figcenter illowp74" id="i340">
      <img class="w100" src="images/i340.jpg" alt="" />
      <div class="caption">Nakkaras. (From a Chinese original.)</div>
    </div>

    <p>The privilege of employing the Nakkara in personal state was one granted by
      the sovereign as a high honour and reward.</p>

    <p>The crusades naturalised the word in some form or other in most European
      languages, but in our own apparently with a transfer of meaning. For Wright
      defines <em>Naker</em> as “a cornet or horn of brass.” And Chaucer’s use seems to
      countenance this:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“Pipes, Trompes, Nakeres, and Clariounes,</div>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">On the other hand, Nacchera, in Italian, seems always to have retained the
      meaning of <em>kettle-drum</em>, with the slight exception of a local application
      at Siena to a metal circle or triangle struck with a rod. The fact seems
      to be that there is a double origin, for the Arabic dictionaries not only
      have <em>Naḳḳárah</em>, but <em>Naḳír</em> and <em>Náḳúr</em>, “cornu, tuba.” The orchestra of
      Bibars Bunduḳdári, we are told, consisted of 40 pairs of kettle-drums, 4
      drums, 4 hautbois, and 20 trumpets (<em>Naḳír</em>). (<cite>Sir B. Frere; Della Valle</cite>,

      very tired of it. It is difficult to say whether the style is borrowed from
      the historians of the East or the romancers of the West. Compare the two

    <p>“The Ear of Heaven was deafened with the din of the great <em>Kurkahs</em> and
      Drums, and the Earth shook at the clangour of the Trumpets and Clarions.
      The shafts began to fall like the rain-drops of spring, and blood flowed

    <p><a id="Note_IV26" href="#NoteAnchor_IV26" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—In
      continuation of <a href="#Note_II24">note 4, chap. ii.</a>, we give Gaubil’s conclusion
      of the story of Nayan: “The Emperor had gone ahead with a small force, when
      Nayan’s General came forward with 100,000 men to make a reconnaissance.
      The Sovereign, however, put on a bold front, and though in great danger
      of being carried off, showed no trepidation. It was night, and an urgent
      summons went to call troops to the Emperor’s aid. They marched at once,
      the horsemen taking the foot soldiers on the crupper behind them. Nayan
      all this while was taking it quietly in his camp, and his generals did
      not venture to attack the Emperor, suspecting an ambuscade. Liting then
      took ten resolute men, and on approaching the General’s camp, caused a
      Fire-<em>Pao</em> to be discharged; the report caused a great panic among Nayan’s
      troops, who were very ill disciplined at the best. Meanwhile the Chinese
      and Tartar troops had all come up, and Nayan was attacked on all sides:
      by Liting at the head of the Chinese, by Yusitemur at the head of the
      Mongols, by Tutuha and the Emperor in person at the head of his guards and
      the troops of <em>Kincha</em> (Kipchak). The presence of the Emperor rendered the
      army invincible, and Nayan’s forces were completely defeated. That prince
      himself was taken, and afterwards put to death. The battle took place
      in the vicinity of the river Liao, and the Emperor returned in triumph
      to Shangtu” (207). The Chinese record given in detail by Pauthier is to
      the like effect, except as to the Kaan’s narrow escape, of which it says nothing.</p>

    <p>As regards the Fire-<em>Pao</em> (the latter word seems to have been applied to
      military machines formerly, and now to artillery), I must refer to Favé and
      Reinaud’s very curious and interesting treatise on the Greek fire (<em>du Feu
      Grégeois</em>). They do not seem to assent to the view that the arms of this
      description which are mentioned in the Mongol wars were cannon, but rather
      of the nature of rockets.</p>

    <p>[Dr. G. Schlegel (<cite>T’oung Pao</cite>, No. 1, 1902), in a paper entitled, <cite>On the
      Invention and Use of Fire-Arms and Gunpowder in China, prior to the Arrival
      of Europeans</cite>, says that “now, notwithstanding all what has been alleged
      by different European authors against the use of gunpowder and fire-arms
      in China, I maintain that not only the Mongols in 1293 had cannon, but
      that they were already acquainted with them in 1232.” Among his many
      examples, we quote the following from the Books of the Ming Dynasty: “What
      were anciently called <em>P’ao</em> were all machines for hurling stones. In the
      beginning of the Mongol Dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1260), <em>p’ao</em> (catapults) of the
      Western regions were procured. In the siege [in 1233] of the city of <em>Ts’ai
      chow</em> of the <em>Kin</em> (Tatars), fire was for the first time employed (in these
      <em>p’ao</em>), but the art of making them was not handed down, and they were
      afterwards seldom used.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_V2"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER V</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">How the Great Kaan caused Nayan to be put to death.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> when the Great Kaan learned that Nayan was taken right glad was he, and
    commanded that he should be put to death straightway and in secret, lest
    endeavours should be made to obtain pity and pardon for him, because he was
    of the Kaan’s own flesh and blood. And this was the way in which he was put
    to death: he was wrapt in a carpet, and tossed to and fro so mercilessly
    that he died. And the Kaan caused him to be put to death in this way
    because he would not have the blood of his Line Imperial spilt upon the
    ground or exposed in the eye of Heaven and before the Sun.<a id="NoteAnchor_V21" href="#Note_V21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>And when the Great Kaan had gained this battle, as you have heard, all the
    Barons and people of Nayan’s provinces renewed their fealty to the Kaan.
    Now these provinces that had been under the Lordship of Nayan were four
    in number; to wit, the first called <span class="smcap">Chorcha</span>; the second <span class="smcap">Cauly</span>; the third
    <span class="smcap">Barscol</span>; the fourth <span class="smcap">Sikintinju</span>. Of all these four great provinces had Nayan
    been Lord; it was a very great dominion.<a id="NoteAnchor_V22" href="#Note_V22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>And after the Great Kaan had conquered Nayan, as you have heard, it came
    to pass that the different kinds of people who were present, Saracens and
    Idolaters and Jews,<a id="NoteAnchor_V23" href="#Note_V23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> and many others that believed not in God, did
    gibe those that were Christians because of the cross that Nayan had borne
    on his standard, and that so grievously that there was no bearing it. Thus
    they would say to the Christians: “See now what precious help this God’s
    Cross of yours hath <span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>rendered Nayan, who was a Christian and a worshipper
    thereof.” And such a din arose about the matter that it reached the Great
    Kaan’s own ears. When it did so, he sharply rebuked those who cast these
    gibes at the Christians; and he also bade the Christians be of good heart,
    “for if the Cross had rendered no help to Nayan, in that It had done right
    well; nor could that which was good, as It was, have done otherwise; for
    Nayan was a disloyal and traitorous Rebel against his Lord, and well
    deserved that which had befallen him. Wherefore the Cross of your God did
    well in that It gave him no help against the right.” And this he said so
    loud that everybody heard him. The Christians then replied to the Great
    Kaan: “Great King, you say the truth indeed, for our Cross can render no
    one help in wrong-doing; and therefore it was that It aided not Nayan, who
    was guilty of crime and disloyalty, for It would take no part in his evil deeds.”</p>

  <p>And so thenceforward no more was heard of the floutings of the unbelievers
    against the Christians; for they heard very well what the Sovereign said to
    the latter about the Cross on Nayan’s banner, and its giving him no help.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_V21" href="#NoteAnchor_V21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Friar Ricold mentions this Tartar maxim: “One Khan will put another
      to death, to get possession of the throne, but he takes great care that
      the blood be not spilt. For they say that it is highly improper that the
      blood of the Great Khan should be spilt upon the ground; so they cause the
      victim to be smothered somehow or other.” The like feeling prevails at the
      Court of Burma, where a peculiar mode of execution without bloodshed is
      reserved for Princes of the Blood. And Kaempfer, relating the conspiracy of
      Faulcon at the Court of Siam, says that two of the king’s brothers, accused
      of participation, were beaten to death with clubs of sandal-wood, “for
      the respect entertained for the blood-royal forbids its being shed.” See
      also <a href="#Note_VI16">note 6, ch. vi. Bk. I.</a>, on the death of the Khalif Mosta’sim Billah.

      is the Manchu country, Niuché of the Chinese. (<i>Supra</i>, <a href="#Note_XLVI12">note
      2, ch. xlvi. Bk. I.</a>) [“Chorcha is Churchin.—Nayan, as vassal of the Mongol
      khans, had the commission to keep in obedience the people of Manchuria
      (subdued in 1233), and to care for the security of the country (<em>Yuen
      shi</em>); there is no doubt that he shared these obligations with his relative
      Hatan, who stood nearer to the native tribes of Manchuria.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>,
      32.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span></p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Kauli</span> is properly Corea, probably here a district on the frontier thereof,
      as it is improbable that Nayan had any rule over Corea. [“The Corean
      kingdom proper could not be a part of the prince’s appanage. Marco Polo
      might mean the northern part of Corea, which submitted to the Mongols in
      <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1269, with sixty towns, and which was subordinated entirely to the
      central administration in Liao-yang. As to the southern part of Corea, it
      was left to the king of Corea, who, however, was a vassal of the Mongols.”
      (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 32.) The king of Corea (<em>Ko rye, Kao-li</em>) was in 1288
      Chyoung ryel wang (1274–1298); the capital was Syong-to, now Kăi syeng
      (K’ai-ch’eng).—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Barskul</span>, “Leopard-Lake,” is named in Sanang Setsen (p. 217), but seems
      there to indicate some place in the west of Mongolia, perhaps the <em>Barkul</em>
      of our maps. This Barskul must have been on the Manchu frontier. [There are
      in the <cite>Yuen-shi</cite> the names of the department of <em>P’u-yü-lu</em>, and of the
      place <em>Pu-lo-ho</em>, which, according to the system of Chinese transcription,
      approach to Barscol; but it is difficult to prove this identification,
      since our knowledge of these places is very scanty; it only remains to
      identify Barscol with Abalahu, which is already known; a conjecture all
      the more probable as the two names of P’u-yü-lu and Pu-lo-ho have also
      some resemblance to Abalahu. (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 32.) Mr. E. H. Parker says
      (<cite>China Review</cite>, xviii. p. 261) that Barscol may be Pa-la ssŭ or Bars Koto
      [in Tsetsen]. “This seems the more probable in that Cauly and Chorcha are
      clearly proved to be Corea and Niuché or Manchuria, so that Bars Koto would
      naturally fall within Nayan’s appanage.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The reading of the fourth name is doubtful, <em>Sichuigiu</em>, <em>Sichingiu</em> (G.
      T.), <em>Sichin-tingiu</em>, etc. The Chinese name of Mukden is <em>Shing-king</em>,
      but I know not if it be so old as our author’s time. I think it very
      possible that the real reading is <em>Sinchin-tingin</em>, and that it represents
      <span class="smcap">Shangking-Tungking</span>, expressing the two capitals of the Khitan Dynasty in
      this region, the position of which will be found indicated in <a href="#i464">No. IV. map</a>
      of Polo’s itineraries. (See <cite>Schott, Aelteste Nachrichten von Mongolen und
      Tartaren</cite>, Berlin Acad. 1845, pp. 11–12.)</p>

    <p>[Sikintinju is Kien chau “belonging to a town which was in Nayan’s
      appanage, and is mentioned in the history of his rebellion. There were two
      Kien-chow, one in the time of the Kin in the modern aimak of Khorchin; the
      other during the Mongol Dynasty, on the upper part of the river Ta-ling
      ho, in the limits of the modern aimak of Kharachin (<em>Man chow yuen lew
      k’ao</em>); the latter depended on Kuang-ning (<cite>Yuen-shi</cite>). Mention is made
      of Kien-chow, in connection with the following circumstance. When Nayan’s
      rebellion broke out, the Court of Peking sent orders to the King of Corea,
      requiring from him auxiliary troops; this circumstance is mentioned in
      the Corean Annals, under the year 1288 (<cite>Kao li shi</cite>, ch. xxx. f. 11) in
      the following words:—‘In the present year, in the fourth month, orders
      were received from Peking to send five thousand men with provisions
      to Kien-chow, which is 3000 <i>li</i> distant from the King’s residence.’
      This number of <i>li</i> cannot of course be taken literally; judging by the
      distances estimated at the present day, it was about 2000 <i>li</i> from the
      Corean K’ai-ch’eng fu (then the Corean capital) to the Mongol Kien-chow;
      and as much to the Kien-chow of the Kin (through Mukden and the pass of
      Fa-k’u mun in the willow palisade). It is difficult to decide to which of
      these two cities of the same name the troops were ordered to go, but at any
      rate, there are sufficient reasons to identify Sikintinju of Marco Polo
      with Kien-chow.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 33.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>We learn from Gaubil that the rebellion did not end with the capture of
      Nayan. In the summer of 1288 several of the princes of Nayan’s league,
      under Hatan (apparently the <em>Abkan</em> of Erdmann’s genealogies), the grandson
      of Chinghiz’s brother Kajyun [Hachiun], threatened the provinces north-east
      of the wall. Kúblái sent his grandson and designated heir, Teimur, against
      them, accompanied by some of his best generals. After a two days’ fight
      on the banks of the River Kweilei, the rebels were completely beaten. The
      territories on the said River <em>Kweilei</em>, the <em>Tiro</em>, or <em>Torro</em>, and the
      <em>Liao</em>, are mentioned both by Gaubil and De Mailla as among those which
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>had belonged to Nayan. As the Kweilei and Toro appear on our maps and also
      the better-known Liao, we are thus enabled to determine with tolerable
      precision Nayan’s country. (See <cite>Gaubil</cite>, p. 209, and <cite>De Mailla</cite>, 431 <i>seqq.</i>)</p>

    <p>[“The rebellion of Nayan and Hatan is incompletely and contradictorily
      related in Chinese history. The suppression of both these rebellions lasted
      four years. In 1287 Nayan marched from his <em>ordo</em> with sixty thousand
      men through Eastern Mongolia. In the 5th moon (<i>var.</i> 6th) of the same
      year Khubilai marched against him from Shangtu. The battle was fought in
      South-Eastern Mongolia, and gained by Khubilai, who returned to Shangtu
      in the 8th month. Nayan fled to the south-east, across the mountain
      range, along which a willow palisade now stands; but forces had been sent
      beforehand from Shin-chow (modern Mukden) and Kuang-ning (probably to watch
      the pass), and Nayan was made prisoner.</p>

    <p>“Two months had not passed, when Hatan’s rebellion broke out (so that it
      took place in the same year 1287). It is mentioned under the year 1288,
      that Hatan was beaten, and that the whole of Manchuria was pacified; but
      in 1290, it is again recorded that Hatan disturbed Southern Manchuria,
      and that he was again defeated. It is to this time that the narratives in
      the biographies of Liting, Yuesi Femur, and Mangwu ought to be referred.
      According to the first of these biographies, Hatan, after his defeat by
      Liting on the river Kui lui (Kuilar?), fled, and perished. According to the
      second biography, Hatan’s dwelling (on the Amur River) was destroyed, and
      he disappeared. According to the third, Mangwu and Naimatai pursued Hatan
      to the extreme north, up to the eastern sea-coast (the mouth of the Amur).
      Hatan fled, but two of his wives and his son Lao-ti were taken; the latter
      was executed, and this was the concluding act of the suppression of the
      rebellion in Manchuria. We find, however, an important <em>variante</em> in the
      history of Corea; it is stated there that in 1290, Hatan and his son Lao-ti
      were carrying fire and slaughter to Corea, and devastated that country;
      they slew the inhabitants and fed on human flesh. The King of Corea fled
      to the Kiang-hwa island. The Coreans were not able to withstand the
      invasion. The Mongols sent to their aid in 1291, troops under the command
      of two generals, Seshekan (who was at that time governor of Liao-tung) and
      Namantai (evidently the above-mentioned Naimatai). The Mongols conjointly
      with the Coreans defeated the insurgents, who had penetrated into the very
      heart of the country; their corpses covered a space 30 <i>li</i> in extent;
      Hatan and his son made their way through the victorious army and fled,
      finding a refuge in the Niuchi (Djurdji) country, from which Laotai made a
      later incursion into Corea. Such is the discrepancy between historians in
      relating the same fact. The statement found in the Corean history seems to
      me more reliable than the facts given by Chinese history.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>,
      35–37.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_V23" href="#NoteAnchor_V23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—This passage, and the extract from Ramusio’s version attached to
      the following chapter, contain the only allusions by Marco to Jews in
      China. John of Monte Corvino alludes to them, and so does Marignolli,
      who speaks of having held disputations with them at Cambaluc; Ibn Batuta
      also speaks of them at Khansa or Hangchau. Much has been written about
      the ancient settlement of Jews at Kaifungfu, in Honan. One of the most
      interesting papers on the subject is in the <cite>Chinese Repository</cite>, vol. xx.
      It gives the translation of a Chinese-Jewish Inscription, which in some
      respects forms a singular parallel to the celebrated Christian Inscription
      of Si-ngan fu, though it is of far more modern date (1511). It exhibits,
      as that inscription does, the effect of Chinese temperament or language,
      in modifying or diluting doctrinal statements. Here is a passage: “With
      respect to the Israelitish religion, we find on inquiry that its first
      ancestor, Adam, came originally from India, and that during the (period
      of the) Chau State the Sacred Writings were already in existence. The
      Sacred Writings, embodying Eternal Reason, consist of 53 sections. The
      principles therein contained are very abstruse, and the Eternal Reason
      therein revealed is very mysterious, being treated with the same veneration
      as Heaven. The founder of the religion is Abraham, who is considered the
      first teacher of it. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>Then came Moses, who established the Law, and handed
      down the Sacred Writings. After his time, during the Han Dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 206
      to <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 221), this religion entered China. In (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) 1164, a synagogue was
      built at P’ien. In (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>) 1296, the old Temple was rebuilt, as a place in
      which the Sacred Writings might be deposited with veneration.”</p>

    <p>[According to their oral tradition, the Jews came to China from <cite>Si Yĭh</cite>
      (Western Regions), probably Persia, by Khorasan and Samarkand, during the
      first century of our era, in the reign of the Emperor Ming-ti (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 58–75)
      of the Han Dynasty. They were at times confounded with the followers of
      religions of India, <em>T’ien Chu kiao</em>, and very often with the Mohammedans
      <em>Hwui-Hwui</em> or <em>Hwui-tzŭ</em>; the common name of their religion was <em>Tiao kin
      kiao</em>, “Extract Sinew Religion.” However, three lapidary inscriptions,
      kept at Kaï-fung, give different dates for the arrival of the Jews in
      China: one dated 1489 (2nd year Hung Che, Ming Dynasty) says that seventy
      Jewish families arrived at P’ien liang (Kaï-fung) at the time of the
      Sung (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 960–1278); one dated 1512 (7th year Chêng Têh) says that the
      Jewish religion was introduced into China under the Han Dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
      206–<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 221), and the last one dated 1663 (2nd year K’ang-hi) says that
      this religion was first preached in China under the Chau Dynasty (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
      1122–255); this will not bear discussion.</p>

    <p>The synagogue, according to these inscriptions, was built in 1163, under
      the Sung Emperor Hiao; under the Yuen, in 1279, the rabbi rebuilt the
      ancient temple known as <em>Ts’ing Chen sse</em>, probably on the site of a ruined
      mosque; the synagogue was rebuilt in 1421 during the reign of Yung-lo; it
      was destroyed by an inundation of the Hwang-ho in 1642, and the Jews began
      to rebuild it once more in 1653.</p>

    <p>The first knowledge Europeans had of a colony of Jews at K’aï-fung fu,
      in the Ho-nan province, was obtained through the Jesuit missionaries at
      Peking, at the beginning of the 17th century; the celebrated Matteo Ricci
      having received the visit of a young Jew, the Jesuits Aleni (1613), Gozani
      (1704), Gaubil and Domenge who made in 1721 two plans of the synagogue,
      visited Kaï-fung and brought back some documents. In 1850, a mission
      of enquiry was sent to that place by the <cite>London Society for promoting
      Christianity among the Jews</cite>; the results of this mission were published
      at Shang-haï, in 1851, by Bishop G. Smith of Hongkong; fac-similes of the
      Hebrew manuscripts obtained at the synagogue of Kaï-fung were also printed
      at Shang-haï at the London Missionary Society’s Press, in the same year.
      The Jewish merchants of London sent in 1760 to their brethren of Kaï-fung
      a letter written in Hebrew; a Jewish merchant of Vienna, J. L. Liebermann,
      visited the Kaï-fung colony in 1867. At the time of the T’aï-P’ing
      rising, the rebels marched against Kaï-fung in 1857, and with the rest
      of the population, the Jews were dispersed. (<cite>J. Tobar, Insc. juives de
      Kaï-fong-fou</cite>, 1900; <cite>Henri Cordier</cite>, <cite>Les Juifs en Chine</cite>, and <cite>Fung and
      Wagnall’s Jewish Encyclopedia</cite>.) Palladius writes (p. 38), “The Jews are
      mentioned for the first time in the <cite>Yuen shi</cite> (ch. xxxiii. p. 7), under
      the year 1329, on the occasion of the re-establishment of the law for the
      collection of taxes from dissidents. Mention of them is made again under
      the year 1354, ch. xliii. fol. 10, when on account of several insurrections
      in China, rich Mahommetans and Jews were invited to the capital in order to
      join the army. In both cases they are named <cite>Chu hu</cite> (Djuhud).”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The synagogue at Kaifungfu has recently been demolished for the sake of its
      materials, by the survivors of the Jewish community themselves, who were
      too poor to repair it. The tablet that once adorned its entrance, bearing
      in gilt characters the name <span class="smcap">Eszloyih</span> (Israel), has been appropriated by
      a mosque. The 300 or 400 survivors seem in danger of absorption into the
      Mahomedan or heathen population. The last Rabbi and possessor of the sacred
      tongue died some thirty or forty years ago, the worship has ceased, and
      their traditions have almost died away.</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Great Kaan went back to the City of Cambaluc.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> after the Great Kaan had defeated Nayan in the way you have heard, he
    went back to his capital city of Cambaluc and abode there, taking his ease
    and making festivity. And the other Tartar Lord called Caydu was greatly
    troubled when he heard of the defeat and death of Nayan, and held himself
    in readiness for war; but he stood greatly in fear of being handled as
    Nayan had been.<a id="NoteAnchor_VI21" href="#Note_VI21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>I told you that the Great Kaan never went on a campaign but once, and it
    was on this occasion; in all other cases of need he sent his sons or his
    barons into the field. But this time he would have none go in command but
    himself, for he regarded the presumptuous rebellion of Nayan as far too
    serious and perilous an affair to be otherwise dealt with.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_VI21" href="#NoteAnchor_VI21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Here Ramusio has a long and curious addition. Kúblái, it says,
      remained at Cambaluc till March, “in which our Easter occurs; and learning
      that this was one of our chief festivals, he summoned all the Christians,
      and bade them bring with them the Book of the Four Gospels. This he caused
      to be incensed many times with great ceremony, kissing it himself most
      devoutly, and desiring all the barons and lords who were present to do the
      same. And he always acts in this fashion at the chief Christian festivals,
      such as Easter and Christmas. And he does the like at the chief feasts of
      the Saracens, Jews, and Idolaters. On being asked why, he said: ‘There
      are Four Prophets worshipped and revered by all the world. The Christians
      say their God is Jesus Christ; the Saracens, Mahommet; the Jews, Moses;
      the Idolaters, Sogomon Borcan [<em>Sakya-Muni Burkhan</em> or Buddha], who was
      the first god among the idols; and I worship and pay respect to all four,
      and pray that he among them who is greatest in heaven in very truth may
      aid me.’ But the Great Khan let it be seen well enough that he held the
      Christian Faith to be the truest and best—for, as he says, it commands
      nothing that is not perfectly good and holy. But he will not allow the
      Christians to carry the Cross before them, because on it was scourged and
      put to death a person so great and exalted as Christ.</p>

    <p>“Some one may say: ‘Since he holds the Christian faith to be best, why
      does he not attach himself to it, and become a Christian?’ Well, this is
      the reason that he gave to Messer Nicolo and Messer Maffeo, when he sent
      them as his envoys to the Pope, and when they sometimes took occasion to
      speak to him about the faith of Christ. He said: ‘How would you have me
      to become a Christian? You see that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>the Christians of these parts are so
      ignorant that they achieve nothing and can achieve nothing, whilst you
      see the Idolaters can do anything they please, insomuch that when I sit
      at table the cups from the middle of the hall come to me full of wine or
      other liquor without being touched by anybody, and I drink from them. They
      control storms, causing them to pass in whatever direction they please, and
      do many other marvels; whilst, as you know, their idols speak, and give
      them predictions on whatever subjects they choose. But if I were to turn
      to the faith of Christ and become a Christian, then my barons and others
      who are not converted would say: “What has moved you to be baptised and
      to take up the faith of Christ? What powers or miracles have you witnessed
      on His part?” (You know the Idolaters here say that their wonders are
      performed by the sanctity and power of their idols.) Well, I should not
      know what answer to make; so they would only be confirmed in their errors,
      and the Idolaters, who are adepts in such surprising arts, would easily
      compass my death. But now you shall go to your Pope, and pray him on my
      part to send hither an hundred men skilled in your law, who shall be
      capable of rebuking the practices of the Idolaters to their faces, and of
      telling them that they too know how to do such things but will not, because
      they are done by the help of the devil and other evil spirits, and shall
      so control the Idolaters that these shall have no power to perform such
      things in their presence. When we shall witness this we will denounce the
      Idolaters and their religion, and then I will receive baptism; and when I
      shall have been baptised, then all my barons and chiefs shall be baptised
      also, and their followers shall do the like, and thus in the end there will
      be more Christians here than exist in your part of the world!’</p>

    <p>“And if the Pope, as was said in the beginning of this book, had sent men
      fit to preach our religion, the Grand Kaan would have turned Christian; for
      it is an undoubted fact that he greatly desired to do so.”</p>

    <p>In the simultaneous patronage of different religions, Kúblái followed the
      practice of his house. Thus Rubruquis writes of his predecessor Mangku
      Kaan: “It is his custom, on such days as his diviners tell him to be
      festivals, or any of the Nestorian priests declare to be holydays, to hold
      a court. On these occasions the Christian priests enter first with their
      paraphernalia, and pray for him, and bless his cup. They retire, and then
      come the Saracen priests and do likewise; the priests of the Idolaters
      follow. He all the while believes in none of them, though they all follow
      his court as flies follow honey. He bestows his gifts on all of them, each
      party believes itself to be his favourite, and all prophesy smooth things
      to him.” Abulfaragius calls Kúblái “a just prince and a wise, who loved
      Christians and honoured physicians of learning, whatsoever their nation.”</p>

    <p>There is a good deal in Kúblái that reminds us of the greatest prince
      of that other great Mongol house, Akbar. And if we trusted the first
      impression of the passage just quoted from Ramusio, we might suppose that
      the grandson of Chinghiz too had some of that real wistful regard towards
      the Lord Jesus Christ, of which we seem to see traces in the grandson of
      Baber. But with Kúblái, as with his predecessors, religion seems to have
      been only a political matter; and this aspect of the thing will easily
      be recognised in a re-perusal of his conversation with Messer Nicolas
      and Messer Maffeo. The Kaan must be obeyed; how man shall worship God is
      indifferent; this was the constant policy of his house in the days of its
      greatness. Kúblái, as Koeppen observes, the first of his line to raise
      himself above the natural and systematic barbarism of the Mongols, probably
      saw in the promotion of Tibetan Buddhism, already spread to some extent
      among them, the readiest means of civilising his countrymen. But he may
      have been quite sincere in saying what is here ascribed to him in <em>this</em>
      sense, viz.: that if the Latin Church, with its superiority of character
      and acquirement, had come to his aid as he had once requested, he would
      gladly have used <em>its</em> missionaries as his civilising instruments instead
      of the Lamas and their trumpery. (<cite>Rubr.</cite> 313; <cite>Assemani</cite>, III. pt. ii.

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_VII2"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER VII</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">How the Kaan rewarded the Valour of his Captains.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> we will have done with this matter of Nayan, and go on with our account
    of the great state of the Great Kaan.</p>

  <p>We have already told you of his lineage and of his age; but now I must tell
    you what he did after his return, in regard to those barons who had behaved
    well in the battle. Him who was before captain of 100 he made captain of
    1000; and him who was captain of 1000 men he made to be captain of 10,000,
    advancing every man according to his deserts and to his previous rank.
    Besides that, he also made them presents of fine silver plate and other
    rich appointments; gave them Tablets of Authority of a higher degree than
    they held before; and bestowed upon them fine jewels of gold and silver,
    and pearls and precious stones; insomuch that the amount that fell to each
    of them was something astonishing. And yet ’twas not so much as they had
    deserved; for never were men seen who did such feats of arms for the love
    and honour of their Lord, as these had done on that day of the battle.<a id="NoteAnchor_VII21" href="#Note_VII21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>Now those Tablets of Authority, of which I have spoken, are ordered in
    this way. The officer who is a captain of 100 hath a tablet of silver; the
    captain of 1000 hath a tablet of gold or silver-gilt; the commander of
    10,000 hath a tablet of gold, with a lion’s head on it. And I will tell
    you the weight of the different tablets, and what they denote. The tablets
    of the captains of 100 and 1000 weigh each of them 120 <em>saggi</em>; and the
    tablet with the lion’s head engraven on it, which is that of the commander
    of 10,000, weighs 220 <em>saggi</em>. And on <span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>each of the tablets is inscribed a
    device, which runs: “<em>By the strength of the great God, and of the great
    grace which He hath accorded to our Emperor, may the name of the Kaan be
    blessed; and let all such as will not obey him be slain and be destroyed</em>.”
    And I will tell you besides that all who hold these tablets likewise
    receive warrants in writing, declaring all their powers and privileges.</p>

  <p>I should mention too that an officer who holds the chief command of 100,000
    men, or who is general-in-chief of a great host, is entitled to a tablet
    that weighs 300 <em>saggi</em>. It has an inscription thereon to the same purport
    that I have told you already, and below the inscription there is the figure
    of a lion, and below the lion the sun and moon. They have warrants also of
    their high rank, command, and power.<a id="NoteAnchor_VII22" href="#Note_VII22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> Every one, moreover, who holds
    a tablet of this exalted degree is entitled, whenever he goes abroad, to
    have a little golden canopy, such as is called an umbrella, carried on a
    spear over his head in token of his high command. And whenever he sits, he
    sits in a silver chair.<a id="NoteAnchor_VII23" href="#Note_VII23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>To certain very great lords also there is given a tablet with gerfalcons on
    it; this is only to the very greatest of the Kaan’s barons, and it confers
    on them his own full power and authority; so that if one of those chiefs
    wishes to send a messenger any whither, he can seize the horses of any man,
    be he even a king, and any other chattels at his pleasure.<a id="NoteAnchor_VII24" href="#Note_VII24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_VII21" href="#NoteAnchor_VII21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—So Sanang Setzen relates that Chinghiz, on returning from one
      of his great campaigns, busied himself in reorganising his forces and
      bestowing rank and title, according to the deserts of each, on his nine
      <em>Orlok</em>, or marshals, and all who had done good service. “He named
      commandants over hundreds, over thousands, over ten thousands, over hundred
      thousands, and opened his treasury to the multitude of the people” (p. 91).</p>

    <p><a id="Note_VII22" href="#NoteAnchor_VII22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—We have several times already had mention of these tablets. (See
      Prologue, <a href="#CHAPTER_VIIIp">ch. viii.</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIIIp">xviii.</a>) The earliest European allusion to them is
      in Rubruquis: “And Mangu gave to the Moghul (whom he was going to send to
      the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>King of France) a bull of his, that is to say, a golden plate of a palm
      in breadth and half a cubit in length, on which his orders were inscribed.
      Whosoever is the bearer of that may order what he pleases, and his order
      shall be executed straightway.”</p>

    <p>These golden bulls of the Mongol Kaans appear to have been originally
      tokens of high favour and honour, though afterwards they became more
      frequent and conventional. They are often spoken of by the Persian
      historians of the Mongols under the name of <em>Páïzah</em>, and sometimes <em>Páïzah
      Sir-i-Sher</em>, or “Lion’s Head Paizah.” Thus, in a firmán of Ghazan Khan,
      naming a viceroy to his conquests in Syria, the Khan confers on the latter
      “the sword, the august standard, the drum, and <em>the Lion’s Head Paizah</em>.”
      Most frequently the grant of this honour is coupled with <em>Yarlígh</em>; “to
      such an one were granted <em>Yarlígh</em> and <em>Páïzah</em>,” the former word (which is
      still applied in Turkey to the Sultan’s rescripts) denoting the written
      patent which accompanies the grant of the tablet, just as the sovereign’s
      warrant accompanies the badge of a modern Order. Of such written patents
      also Marco speaks in this passage, and as he uttered it, no doubt the
      familiar words <em>Yarlígh u Páïzah</em> were in his mind. The Armenian history of
      the Orpelians, relating the visit of Prince Sempad, brother of King Hayton,
      to the court of Mangku Kaan, says: “They gave him also a <em>P’haiza</em> of gold,
      <i>i.e.</i> a tablet whereon the name of God is written by the Great Kaan himself;
      and this constitutes the greatest honour known among the Mongols. Farther,
      they drew up for him a sort of patent, which the Mongols call <em>Iarlekh</em>,”
      etc. The Latin version of a grant by Uzbek Khan of Kipchak to the Venetian
      Andrea Zeno, in 1333,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
      ends with the words: “<em>Dedimus</em> baisa <em>et</em>
      privilegium <em>cum bullis rubeis</em>,” where the latter words no doubt represent
      the <em>Yarlígh al-tamghá</em>, the warrant with the red seal or stamp,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as it
      may be seen upon the letter of Arghun Khan. (See plate at ch. xvii. of Bk.
      IV.) So also Janibek, the son of Uzbek, in 1344, confers privileges on
      the Venetians, “<em>eisdem dando</em> baissinum <em>de auro</em>”; and again Bardibeg,
      son, murderer, and successor of Janibeg, in 1358, writes: “Avemo dado
      comandamento [<i>i.e.</i> Yarlíg] cum le bolle rosse, et lo <em>paysam</em>.”</p>

      <img class="w100" src="images/i352.jpg" alt="" />
      <div class="caption">Seljukian Coin with the Lion and Sun.</div>
    </div>

    <p>Under the Persian branch, at least, of the house the degree of honour was
      indicated by the <em>number</em> of lions’ heads upon the plate, which varied from
      1 to 5. The Lion and Sun, a symbol which survives, or has been revived,
      in the modern Persian decoration so called, formed the emblem of the Sun
      in Leo, <i>i.e.</i> in highest power. It had already been used on the coins of
      the Seljukian sovereigns of Persia and Iconium; it appears on coins of the
      Mongol Ilkhans Ghazan, Oljaïtu, and Abusaid, and it is also found on some
      of those of Mahomed Uzbek Khan of Kipchak.</p>

    <p>Hammer gives regulations of Ghazan Khan’s on the subject of the Paizah,
      from which it is seen that the latter were of different <em>kinds</em> as well as
      degrees. Some were held by great governors and officers of state, and these
      were cautioned against letting the Paizah out of their own keeping; others
      were for officers of inferior order; and, again, “for persons travelling on
      state commissions with post-horses, particular paizah (which Hammer says
      were of brass) are appointed, on which their names are inscribed.” These
      last would seem therefore to be merely such permissions to travel by the
      Government post-horses as are still required in Russia, perhaps in lineal
      derivation from Mongol practice. The terms of Ghazan’s decree and other
      contemporary notices show that great abuses were practised with the Paizah,
      as an authority for living at free quarters and making other arbitrary
      exactions.</p>

    <p>The word <em>Paizah</em> is said to be Chinese, <em>Pai-tseu</em>, “a tablet.” A trace of
      the name and the thing still survives in Mongolia. The horse-<em>Bai</em> is the
      name applied to a certain ornament on the horse caparison, which gives the
      rider a title to be furnished with horses and provisions on a journey.</p>

    <p>Where I have used the Venetian term <em>saggio</em>, the French texts have here
      and elsewhere <em>saics</em> and <em>saies</em>, and sometimes <em>pois</em>. <em>Saic</em> points to
      <em>saiga</em>, which, according to Dupré de St. Maur, is in the Salic laws the
      equivalent of a denier or the twelfth part of a sol. <em>Saggio</em> is possibly
      the same word, or rather may have been confounded with it, but the saggio
      was a recognised Venetian weight equal to ⅙ of an ounce. We shall see
      hereafter that Polo appears to use it to indicate the <em>misḳál</em>, a weight
      which may be taken at 74 grains Troy. On that supposition the smallest
      tablet specified in the text would weigh 18½ ozs. Troy.</p>

    <p>I do not know if any gold Paizah has been discovered, but several of silver
      have been found in the Russian dominions; one near the Dnieper, and two in
      Eastern Siberia. The first of our plates represents one of these, which was
      found in the Minusinsk circle of the Government of Yenisei in 1846, and is
      now in the Asiatic Museum of the Academy of St. Petersburg. For the sake
      of better illustration of our text, I have taken the liberty to represent
      the tablet as of gold, instead of silver with only the inscription gilt.
      The moulded ring inserted in the orifice, to suspend the plate by, is of
      iron. On the reverse side the ring bears some Chinese characters engraved,
      which are interpreted as meaning “Publication No. 42.” The inscription on
      the plate itself is in the Mongol language and Baspa character (<i>supra</i>,

      the exactness of Marco’s account, and almost a proof of his knowledge of
      the language and character in which the inscriptions were engraved. It
      runs, according to Schmidt’s version: “<em>By the strength of the eternal
      heaven! May the name of the Khagan be holy! Who pays him not reverence
      is to be slain, and must die!</em>” The inscriptions on the other plates
      discovered were essentially similar in meaning. Our second plate shows one
      of them with the inscription in the Uighúr character.</p>

      Ramusio’s copy in the Prologue, where the tables given by Kiacatu are
      mentioned (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a>), says that they were a cubit in length and 5

    <p>[“The History tells us (<cite>Liao Shih</cite>, Bk. LVII. f. 2) that the official
      silver tablets <em>p’ai tzŭ</em> of the period were 600 in number, about a foot
      in length, and that they were engraved with an inscription like the above
      [‘Our imperial order for post horses. Urgent.’] in national characters
      (<em>kuo tzŭ</em>), and that when there was important state business the Emperor
      personally handed the tablet to the envoy, which entitled him to demand
      horses at the post stations, and to be treated as if he were the Emperor
      himself travelling. When the tablet was marked ‘Urgent,’ he had the right
      to take private horses, and was required to ride, night and day, 700 <i>li</i>
      in twenty-four hours. On his return he had to give back the tablet to the
      Emperor, who handed it to the prince who had the custody of the state

    <p>“Tiger’s tablets—<em>Sinice Hu fu</em>, and <em>p’ai tsze</em> in the common language.
      The Mongols had them of several kinds, which differed by the metal, of
      which they were made, as well as by the number of pearls (one, two, or
      three in number), which were incrusted in the upper part of the tablet.
      Falcon’s tablets with the figure of a falcon were round, and used to be
      given only to special couriers and envoys of the Khan. [<em>Yuen shi lui pien</em>
      and <em>Yuen ch’ao tien chang</em>.] The use of the <em>Hu-fu</em> was adopted by the
      Mongols probably from the Kin.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> p. 39.)</p>

    <p>Rubruquis (Rockhill’s ed. pp. 153–154) says:—“And whenever the principal
      envoy [of Longa] came to court he carried a highly-polished tablet of ivory
      about a cubit long and half a palm wide. Every time he spoke to the chan
      or some great personage, he always looked at that tablet as if he found
      there what he had to say, nor did he look to the right or the left, nor
      in the face of him with whom he was talking. Likewise, when coming into
      the presence of the Lord, and when leaving it, he never looked at anything
      but his tablet.” Mr. Rockhill observes: “These tablets are called <em>hu</em> in
      Chinese, and were used in China and Korea; in the latter country down to
      quite recent times. They were made of jade, ivory, bamboo, etc., according
      to the rank of the owner, and were about three feet long. The <em>hu</em> was
      originally used to make memoranda on of the business to be submitted by
      the bearer to the Emperor or to write the answers to questions he had had
      submitted to them. Odoric also refers to ‘the tablets of white ivory which
      the Emperor’s barons held in their hands as they stood silent before him.’”</p>

    <p><a id="Note_VII23" href="#NoteAnchor_VII23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      3.</a>—<em>Umbrella</em>. The phrase in Pauthier’s text is “<em>Palieque que on dit</em>
      ombrel.” The Latin text of the Soc. de Géographie has “<i>unum pallium</i> de
      auro,” which I have adopted as probably correct, looking to Burma, where
      the old etiquettes as to umbrellas are in full force. These etiquettes were
      probably in both countries of old Hindu origin. <i>Pallium</i>, according to
      Muratori, was applied in the Middle Ages to a kind of square umbrella, by
      which is probably meant rather a canopy on four staves, which was sometimes
      assigned by authority as an honourable privilege.</p>

    <p>But the genuine umbrella would seem to have been used also, for Polo’s
      contemporary, Martino da Canale, says that, when the Doge goes forth of
      his palace, “<i lang="fr">si vait apres lui un damoiseau qui porte une umbrele de
      dras à or sur son chief</i>,” which umbrella had been given by “<i>Monseigneur
      l’Apostoille</i>.” There is a picture by Girolamo Gambarota, in the Sala
      del Gran Consiglio, at Venice, which represents the investiture of the
      Doge with the umbrella by Pope Alexander III., and Frederick Barbarossa
      (concerning which see <cite>Sanuto</cite> Junior, in <cite>Muratori</cite>, XXII. 512).</p>

    <p>The word <em>Parasol</em> also occurs in the Petrarchian vocabulary, (14th
      century) as the equivalent of <em>saioual</em> (Pers. <em>sáyában</em> or <em>sáiwán</em>,
      an umbrella). Carpini notices that umbrellas (<i lang="la">solinum vel tentoriolum
      in hastâ</i>) were carried over the Tartar nobles and their wives, even on
      horseback; and a splendid one, covered with jewels, was one of the presents
      made to Kuyuk Kaan on his enthronement.</p>

    <p>With respect to the honorary character attaching to umbrellas in China, I
      may notice that recently an English resident of Ningpo, on his departure
      for Europe, was presented by the Chinese citizens, as a token of honour,
      with a pair of <em>Wan min sàn</em>, umbrellas of enormous size.</p>

    <p>The umbrella must have gone through some curious vicissitudes; for at
      one time we find it familiar, at a later date apparently unknown, and
      then reintroduced as some strange novelty. Arrian speaks of the <span lang="el">σκιάδια</span>,
      or umbrellas, as used by all Indians of any consideration; but
      the thing of which he spoke was familiar to the use of Greek and Roman
      ladies, and many examples of it, borne by slaves behind their mistresses,
      are found on ancient vase-paintings. Athenaeus quotes from Anacreon the
      description of a “beggar on horseback” who</p>

    <p>An Indian prince, in a Sanskrit inscription of the 9th century, boasts
      of having wrested from the King of Márwár the two umbrellas pleasing to
      Parvati, and white as the summer moonbeams. Prithi Ráj, the last Hindu king
      of Delhi, is depicted by the poet Chand as shaded by a white umbrella on
      a golden staff. An unmistakable umbrella, copied from a Saxon MS. in the
      Harleian collection, is engraved in <cite>Wright’s History of Domestic Manners</cite>,
      p. 75. The fact that the gold umbrella is one of the paraphernalia of high
      church dignitaries in Italy seems to presume acquaintance with the thing
      from a remote period. A decorated umbrella also accompanies the host when
      sent out to the sick, at least where I write, in Palermo. Ibn Batuta says
      that in his time all the people of Constantinople, civil and military,
      great and small, carried great umbrellas over their heads, summer and
      winter. Ducange quotes, from a MS. of the Paris Library, the Byzantine
      court regulations about umbrellas, which are of the genuine Pan-Asiatic
      spirit;—<span lang="el">σκιάδια χρυσοκóκκινα</span> extend from the Hypersebastus to
      the grand Stratopedarchus, and so on; exactly as used to be the case, with
      different titles, in Java. And yet it is curious that John Marignolli, Ibn
      Batuta’s contemporary in the middle of the 14th century, and Barbosa in the
      16th century, are alike at pains to describe the umbrella as some strange
      object. And in our own country it is commonly stated that the umbrella
      was first used in the last century, and that Jonas Hanway (died 1786) was
      one of the first persons who made a practice of carrying one. The word
      <em>umbrello</em> is, however, in Minsheu’s dictionary. [See <cite>Hobson-Jobson</cite>, s.v.

    <p>Alexander, according to Athenaeus, feasted his captains to the number of
      6000, and made them all sit upon silver chairs. The same author relates
      that the King of Persia, among other rich presents, bestowed upon Entimus
      the Gortynian, who went up to the king in imitation of Themistocles, <em>a
      silver chair and a gilt umbrella</em>. (Bk. I. Epit. ch. 31, and II. 31.)</p>

    <p>The silver chair has come down to our own day in India, and is much
      affected by native princes.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_VII24" href="#NoteAnchor_VII24" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—I have not been able to find any allusion, except in our author,
      to tablets, with gerfalcons (<em>shonḳár</em>). The <em>shonḳár</em> appears, however,
      according to Erdmann, on certain coins of the Golden Horde, struck at Sarai.</p>

    <p>There is a passage from Wassáf used by Hammer, in whose words it runs
      that the Sayad Imámuddín, appointed (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 683) governor of Shiraz by
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>Arghun Khan, “was invested with <em>both</em> the Mongol symbols of delegated
      sovereignty, the Golden Lion’s Head, and the golden <em>Cat’s Head</em>.” It would
      certainly have been more satisfactory to find “Gerfalcon’s Head” in lieu
      of the latter; but it is probable that the same object is meant. The cut
      below exhibits the conventional effigy of a gerfalcon as sculptured over
      one of the gates of Iconium, Polo’s Conia. The head might easily pass for
      a conventional representation of a cat’s head, and is indeed strikingly
      like the grotesque representation that bears that name in mediæval
      architecture. (<cite>Erdmann, Numi Asiatici</cite>, I. 339; <cite>Ilch.</cite> I. 370.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Person of the Great Kaan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> personal appearance of the Great Kaan, Lord of Lords, whose name is
    Cublay, is such as I shall now tell you. He is of a good stature, neither
    tall nor short, but of a middle height. He has a becoming amount of flesh,
    and is very shapely in all his limbs. His complexion is white and red, the
    eyes black and fine,<a id="NoteAnchor_VIII21" href="#Note_VIII21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> the nose well formed and well set on. He has
    four wives, whom he retains permanently as his legitimate consorts; and the
    eldest of his sons by those four wives ought by rights to be emperor;—I
    mean when his father dies. Those four ladies are called empresses, but each
    is distinguished also by her proper name. And each of them has a special
    court of her own, very grand and ample; no one of them having fewer than
    300 fair and charming damsels. They have also many pages and eunuchs, and a
    number of other attendants of both sexes; so that each of these ladies has
    not less than 10,000 persons attached to her court.<a id="NoteAnchor_VIII22" href="#Note_VIII22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>When the Emperor desires the society of one of these four consorts, he will
    sometimes send for the lady to his apartment and sometimes visit her at her
    own. He has also a great number of concubines, and I will tell you how he
    obtains them.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span></p>

  <p>You must know that there is a tribe of Tartars called <span class="smcap">Ungrat</span>, who are noted
    for their beauty. Now every year an hundred of the most beautiful maidens
    of this tribe are sent to the Great Kaan, who commits them to the charge
    of certain elderly ladies dwelling in his palace. And these old ladies
    make the girls sleep with them, in order to ascertain if they have sweet
    breath [and do not snore], and are sound in all their limbs. Then such of
    them as are of approved beauty, and are good and sound in all respects,
    are appointed to attend on the Emperor by turns. Thus six of these damsels
    take their turn for three days and nights, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>wait on him when he is in
    his chamber and when he is in his bed, to serve him in any way, and to be
    entirely at his orders. At the end of the three days and nights they are
    relieved by other six. And so throughout the year, there are reliefs of
    maidens by six and six, changing every three days and nights.<a id="NoteAnchor_VIII23" href="#Note_VIII23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

      1.</a>—We are left in some doubt as to the colour of Kúblái’s eyes, for
      some of the MSS. read <em>vairs</em> and <em>voirs</em>, and others <em>noirs</em>. The former
      is a very common epithet for eyes in the mediæval romances. And in the
      ballad on the death of St. Lewis, we are told of his son Tristram:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry" lang="fr">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“Droiz fu comme un rosel, <em>iex vairs comme faucon</em>,</div>
          <div class="i1">Dès le tens Moysel ne nasqui sa façon.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">The word has generally been interpreted <em>bluish-grey</em>, but in the passage
      just quoted, Fr.-Michel explains it by <em>brillans</em>. However, the evidence
      for <em>noirs</em> here seems strongest. Rashiduddin says that when Kúblái was
      born Chinghiz expressed surprise at the child’s being so <em>brown</em>, as
      its father and all his other sons were fair. Indeed, we are told that
      the descendants of Yesugai (the father of Chinghiz) were in general
      distinguished by blue eyes and reddish hair. (<cite>Michel’s Joinville</cite>, p. 324;
      <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, II. 475; <cite>Erdmann</cite>, 252.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_VIII22" href="#NoteAnchor_VIII22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      2.</a>—According to Hammer’s authority (Rashid?) Kúblái had <em>seven</em> wives;
      Gaubil’s Chinese sources assign him <em>five</em>, with the title of empress
      (<em>Hwang-heu</em>). Of these the best beloved was the beautiful Jamúi Khátún
      (Lady or Empress Jamúi, illustrating what the text says of the manner
      of styling these ladies), who bore him four sons and five daughters.
      Rashiduddin adds that she was called <em>Ḳún Ḳú</em>, or the great consort,
      evidently the term <em>Hwang-heu</em>. (Gen. Tables in <cite>Hammer’s Ilkhans</cite>;
      <cite>Gaubil</cite>, 223; <cite>Erdmann</cite>, 200.)</p>

    <p>[“Kúblái’s four wives, <i>i.e.</i> the empresses of the first, second, third, and
      fourth <em>ordos</em>. <em>Ordo</em> is, properly speaking, a separate palace of the
      Khan, under the management of one of his wives. Chinese authors translate
      therefore the word <em>ordo</em> by ‘harem.’ The four <em>Ordo</em> established by
      Chingis Khan were destined for the empresses, who were chosen out of four
      different nomad tribes. During the reign of the first four Khans, who lived
      in Mongolia, the four <em>ordo</em> were considerably distant one from another,
      and the Khans visited them in different seasons of the year; they existed
      nominally as long as China remained under Mongol domination. The custom of
      choosing the empress out of certain tribes, was in the course of time set
      aside by the Khans. The empress, wife of the last Mongol Khan in China, was
      a Corean princess by birth; and she contributed in a great measure to the
      downfall of the Mongol Dynasty.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 40.)</p>

    <p>I do not believe that Rashiduddin’s <em>Kún Kú</em> is the term <em>Hwang-keu</em>; it is
      the term <em>Kiūn Chu</em>, King or Queen, a sovereign.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_VIII23" href="#NoteAnchor_VIII23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—<em>Ungrat</em>, the reading of the Crusca, seems to be that to which the
      others point, and I doubt not that it represents the great Mongol tribe
      of <span class="smcap">Ḳungurat</span>, which gave more wives than any other to the princes of the
      house of Chinghiz; a conclusion in which I find I have been anticipated
      by De Mailla or his editor (IX. 426). To this tribe (which, according to
      Vámbéry, took its name from (Turki) <em>Kongur-At</em>, “Chestnut Horse”) belonged
      Burteh Fujin, the favourite wife of Chinghiz himself, and mother of his
      four heirs; to the same tribe belonged the two wives of Chagatai, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>two
      of Hulaku’s seven wives, one of Mangku Kaan’s, two at least of Kúblái’s
      including the beloved Jamúi Khátún, one at least of Abaka’s, two of Ahmed
      Tigudar’s, two of Arghun’s, and two of Ghazan’s.</p>

    <p>The seat of the Ḳungurats was near the Great Wall. Their name is still
      applied to one of the tribes of the Uzbeks of Western Turkestan, whose body
      appears to have been made up of fractions of many of the Turk and Mongol
      tribes. Kungurat is also the name of a town of Khiva, near the Sea of Aral,
      perhaps borrowed from the Uzbek clan.</p>

    <p>The conversion of <em>Ḳungurat</em> into <em>Ungrat</em> is due, I suppose, to that
      Mongol tendency to soften gutturals which has been before noticed. (<cite>Erdm.</cite>
      199–200; <cite>Hammer, passim; Burnes</cite>, III. 143, 225.)</p>

    <p>The Ramusian version adds here these curious and apparently genuine
      particulars:—</p>

    <p>“The Great Kaan sends his commissioners to the Province to select four or
      five hundred, or whatever number may be ordered, of the most beautiful
      young women, according to the scale of beauty enjoined upon them. And
      they set a value upon the comparative beauty of the damsels in this way.
      The commissioners on arriving assemble all the girls of the province, in
      presence of appraisers appointed for the purpose. These carefully survey
      the points of each girl in succession, as (for example) her hair, her
      complexion, eyebrows, mouth, lips, and the proportion of all her limbs.
      They will then set down some as estimated at 16 carats, some at 17, 18, 20,
      or more or less, according to the sum of the beauties or defects of each.
      And whatever standard the Great Kaan may have fixed for those that are to
      be brought to him, whether it be 20 carats or 21, the commissioners select
      the required number from those who have attained that standard, and bring
      them to him. And when they reach his presence he has them appraised anew by
      other parties, and has a selection made of 30 or 40 of those, who then get
      the highest valuation.”</p>

    <p>Marsden and Murray miss the meaning of this curious statement in a
      surprising manner, supposing the carat to represent some absolute value,
      4 grains of gold according to the former, whence the damsel of 20 carats
      was estimated at 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>! This is sad nonsense; but Marsden would not
      have made the mistake had he not been fortunate enough to live before the
      introduction of Competitive Examinations. This Kungurat business was in
      fact a competitive examination in beauty; total marks attainable 24; no
      candidate to pass who did not get 20 or 21. <em>Carat</em> expresses <i>n</i> ÷ 24, not
      any absolute value.</p>

    <p>Apart from the mode of valuation, it appears that a like system of
      selection was continued by the Ming, and that some such selection from
      the daughters of the Manchu nobles has been maintained till recent times.
      Herodotus tells that the like custom prevailed among the Adyrmachidae,
      the Libyan tribe next Egypt. Old Eden too relates it of the “Princes
      of Moscovia.” (<cite>Middle Km.</cite> I. 318; <cite>Herod.</cite> IV. 168, Rawl.; <cite>Notes on

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Great Kaan’s Sons.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Emperor hath, by those four wives of his, twenty-two male children; the
    eldest of whom was called <span class="smcap">Chinkin</span> for the love of the good Chinghis Kaan,
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>first Lord of the Tartars. And this Chinkin, as the Eldest Son of the
    Kaan, was to have reigned after his father’s death; but, as it came to
    pass, he died. He left a son behind him, however, whose name is <span class="smcap">Temur</span>, and
    he is to be the Great Kaan and Emperor after the death of his Grandfather,
    as is but right; he being the child of the Great Kaan’s eldest son. And
    this Temur is an able and brave man, as he hath already proven on many
    occasions.<a id="NoteAnchor_IX21" href="#Note_IX21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>The Great Kaan hath also twenty-five other sons by his concubines; and
    these are good and valiant soldiers, and each of them is a great chief.
    I tell you moreover that of his children by his four lawful wives there
    are seven who are kings of vast realms or provinces, and govern them
    well; being all able and gallant men, as might be expected. For the Great
    Kaan their sire is, I tell you, the wisest and most accomplished man, the
    greatest Captain, the best to govern men and rule an Empire, as well as the
    most valiant, that ever has existed among all the Tribes of Tartars.<a id="NoteAnchor_IX22" href="#Note_IX22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_IX21" href="#NoteAnchor_IX21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Kúblái had a son older than <span class="smcap">Chimkin</span> or <span class="smcap">Chingkim</span>, to whom Hammer’s
      Genealogical Table gives the name of <em>Jurji</em>, and attributes a son called
      Ananda. The Chinese authorities of Gaubil and Pauthier call him <em>Turchi</em>
      or <em>Torchi</em>, <i>i.e.</i> <em>Dorjé</em>, “Noble Stone,” the Tibetan name of a sacred
      Buddhist emblem in the form of a dumb-bell, representing the <em>Vajra</em> or
      Thunderbolt. Probably Dorjé died early, as in the passage we shall quote
      from Wassáf also Chingkim is styled the Eldest Son: Marco is probably wrong
      in connecting the name of the latter with that of Chinghiz. Schmidt says
      that he does not know what <em>Chingkim</em> means.</p>

    <p>[Mr. Parker says that Chen kim was the <em>third</em> son of Kúblái (<cite>China
      Review</cite>, xxiv. p. 94). Teimur, son of Chen kim, wore the temple name
      (<em>miao-hao</em>) of <em>Ch’êng Tsung</em> and the title of reign (<em>nien-hao</em>) of <em>Yuen
      Chêng</em> and <em>Ta Téh.</em>—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Chingkim died in the 12th moon of 1284–1285, aged 43. He had received a
      Chinese education, and the Chinese Annals ascribe to him all the virtues
      which so often pertain in history to heirs apparent who have not reigned.</p>

    <p>“When Kúblái approached his 70th year,” says Wassáf, “he desired to raise
      his eldest son Chimkin to the position of his representative and declared
      successor, during his own lifetime; so he took counsel with the chiefs,
      in view to giving the Prince a share of his authority and a place on the
      Imperial Throne. The chiefs, who are the Pillars of Majesty and Props of
      the Empire, represented that His Majesty’s proposal to invest his Son,
      during his own lifetime, with Imperial authority, was not in accordance
      with the precedents and Institutes (<em>Yasa</em>) of the World-conquering <span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>Padshah
      Chinghiz Khan; but still they would consent to execute a solemn document,
      securing the Kaanship to Chimkin, and pledging themselves to lifelong
      obedience and allegiance to him. It was, however, the Divine Fiat that the
      intended successor should predecease him who bestowed the nomination....
      The dignitaries of the Empire then united their voices in favour of <span class="smcap">Teimur</span>,
      the son of Chimkin.”</p>

    <p>Teimur, according to the same authority, was the third son of Chimkin; but
      the eldest, Kambala, <em>squinted</em>; the second, Tarmah (properly <em>Tarmabala</em>
      for <em>Dharmaphala</em>, a Buddhist Sanskrit name) was rickety in constitution;
      and on the death of the old Kaan (1294) Teimur was unanimously named to
      the Throne, after some opposition from Kambala, which was put down by
      the decided bearing of the great soldier Bayan. (<cite>Schmidt</cite>, p. 399; <cite>De
      Mailla</cite>, IX. 424; <cite>Gaubil</cite>, 203; <cite>Wassáf</cite>, 46.)</p>

    <p>[The Rev. W. S. Ament (<cite>Marco Polo in Cambaluc</cite>, p. 106), makes the
      following remarks regarding this young prince (Chimkin): “The historians
      give good reasons for their regard for Chen Chin. He had from early years
      exhibited great promise and had shown great proficiency in the military
      art, in government, history, mathematics, and the Chinese classics. He
      was well acquainted with the condition and numbers of the inhabitants of
      Mongolia and China, and with the topography and commerce of the Empire
      (Howorth). He was much beloved by all, except by some of his father’s own
      ministers, whose lives were anything but exemplary. That Kúblái had full
      confidence in his son is shown by the fact that he put the collecting of
      taxes in his hands. The native historians represent him as economical in
      the use of money and wise in the choice of companions. He carefully watched
      the officers in his charge, and would tolerate no extortion of the people.
      After droughts, famines or floods, he would enquire into the condition of
      the people and liberally supply their needs, thus starting them in life
      again. Polo ascribes all these virtues to the Khan himself. Doubtless he
      possessed them in greater or less degree, but father and son were one in
      all these benevolent enterprises.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_IX22" href="#NoteAnchor_IX22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—The Chinese Annals, according to Pauthier and Gaubil, give only
      <em>ten</em> sons to Kúblái, at least by his legitimate wives; Hammer’s Table
      gives <em>twelve</em>. It is very probable that xxii. was an early clerical error
      in the texts of Polo for xii. <em>Dodeci</em> indeed occurs in one MS. (No. 37 of
      our Appendix F), though not one of much weight.</p>

    <p>Of these legitimate sons Polo mentions, in different parts of his work,
      five by name. The following is the list from Hammer and D’Ohsson, with
      the Chinese forms from Pauthier in parentheses. The seven whose names are
      in capitals had the title of <em>Wang</em> or “King” of particular territories,
      as M. Pauthier has shown from the Chinese Annals, thus confirming Marco’s
      accuracy on that point.</p>

    <p>I. Jurji or Dorjé (Torchi). II. <span class="smcap">Chimkin</span> or <span class="smcap">Chingkim</span> (Yu Tsung, King of Yen,
      <i>i.e.</i> Old Peking). III. <span class="smcap">Mangalai</span> (Mankola, “King of the Pacified West”),
      mentioned by Polo (<i>infra</i>, ch. xli.) as King of Kenjanfu or Shensi. IV.
      <span class="smcap">Numugan</span> (Numukan, “Pacifying King of the North”), mentioned by Polo (Bk.
      IV. ch. ii.) as with King George joint leader of the Kaan’s army against
      Kaidu. V. Kuridai (not in Chinese List). VI. <span class="smcap">Hukaji</span> (Hukochi, “King of
      Yunnan”), mentioned by Polo (<i>infra</i>, ch. xlix.) as King of Carajan. VII.
      <span class="smcap">Aghrukji</span> or <span class="smcap">Ukuruji</span> (Gaoluchi, “King of Siping” or Tibet). VIII. Abaji
      (Gaiyachi?). IX. <span class="smcap">Kukju</span> or <span class="smcap">Geukju</span> (Khokhochu, “King of Ning” or Tangut). X.
      Kutuktemur (Hutulu Temurh). XI. <span class="smcap">Tukan</span> (Thohoan, “King of Chinnan”). His
      command lay on the Tungking frontier, where he came to great grief in 1288,
      in consequence of which he was disgraced. (See <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. 272.) XII.
      Temkan (not in Chinese List). Gaubil’s Chinese List omits <em>Hutulu Temurh</em>,
      and introduces a prince called <em>Gantanpouhoa</em> as 4th son.</p>

    <p>M. Pauthier lays great stress on Polo’s intimate knowledge of the Imperial
      affairs (p. 263) because he knew the name of the Hereditary Prince to be
      Teimur; this being, he says, the private name which could not be known
      until after the owner’s death, except by those in the most confidential
      intimacy. The public only <span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>then discovered that, like the Irishman’s dog,
      his real name was Turk, though he had always been called Toby! But M.
      Pauthier’s learning has misled him. At least the secret must have been
      very badly kept, for it was known in Teimur’s lifetime not only to Marco,
      but to Rashiduddin in Persia, and to Hayton in Armenia; to say nothing of
      the circumstance that the name <em>Temur Khaghan</em> is also used during that
      Emperor’s life by Oljaitu Khan of Persia in writing to the King of France a
      letter which M. Pauthier himself republished and commented upon. (See his
      book, p. 780.)</p>

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_X2"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER X</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Palace of the Great Kaan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> must know that for three months of the year, to wit December, January,
    and February, the Great Kaan resides in the capital city of Cathay, which
    is called <span class="smcap">Cambaluc</span>, [and which is at the north-eastern extremity of the
    country]. In that city stands his great Palace, and now I will tell you
    what it is like.</p>

  <p>It is enclosed all round by a great wall forming a square, each side of
    which is a mile in length; that is to say, the whole compass thereof is
    four miles. This you may depend on; it is also very thick, and a good
    ten paces in height, whitewashed and loop-holed all round.<a id="NoteAnchor_X21" href="#Note_X21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> At
    each angle of the wall there is a very fine and rich palace in which the
    war-harness of the Emperor is kept, such as bows and quivers,<a id="NoteAnchor_X22" href="#Note_X22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    saddles and bridles, and bowstrings, and everything needful for an army.
    Also midway between every two of these Corner Palaces there is another of
    the like; so that taking the whole compass of the enclosure you find eight
    vast Palaces stored with the Great Lord’s harness of war.<a id="NoteAnchor_X23" href="#Note_X23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> And you
    must understand that each Palace is assigned to only one kind of article;
    thus one is stored with bows, a second with saddles, a third with bridles,
    and so on in succession right round.<a id="NoteAnchor_X24" href="#Note_X24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span></p>

  <p>The great wall has five gates on its southern face, the middle one being
    the great gate which is never opened on any occasion except when the Great
    Kaan himself goes forth or enters. Close on either side of this great gate
    is a smaller one by which all other people pass; and then towards each
    angle is another great gate, also open to people in general; so that on
    that side there are five gates in all.<a id="NoteAnchor_X25" href="#Note_X25" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>Inside of this wall there is a second, enclosing a space that is somewhat
    greater in length than in breadth. This enclosure also has eight palaces
    corresponding to those of the outer wall, and stored like them with the
    Lord’s harness of war. This wall also hath five gates on the southern
    face, corresponding to those in the outer wall, and hath one gate on each
    of the other faces, as the outer wall hath also. In the middle of the
    second enclosure is the Lord’s Great Palace, and I will tell you what it is
    like.<a id="NoteAnchor_X26" href="#Note_X26" class="fnanchor">{6}</a></p>

  <p>You must know that it is the greatest Palace that ever was. [Towards the
    north it is in contact with the outer wall, whilst towards the south
    there is a vacant space which the Barons and the soldiers are constantly
    traversing.<a id="NoteAnchor_X27" href="#Note_X27" class="fnanchor">{7}</a> The Palace itself] hath no upper story, but is all on
    the ground floor, only the basement is raised some ten palms above the
    surrounding soil [and this elevation is retained by a wall of marble raised
    to the level of the pavement, two paces in width and projecting beyond the
    base of the Palace so as to form a kind of terrace-walk, by which people
    can pass round the building, and which is exposed to view, whilst on the
    outer edge of the wall there is a very fine pillared balustrade; and up to
    this the people are allowed to come]. The roof is very lofty, and the walls
    of the Palace are all covered with gold and silver. They are also adorned
    with representations of dragons [sculptured and gilt], <span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>beasts and birds,
    knights and idols, and sundry other subjects. And on the ceiling too you
    see nothing but gold and silver and painting. [On each of the four sides
    there is a great marble staircase leading to the top of the marble wall,
    and forming the approach to the Palace.]<a id="NoteAnchor_X28" href="#Note_X28" class="fnanchor">{8}</a></p>

  <p>The Hall of the Palace is so large that it could easily dine 6000 people;
    and it is quite a marvel to see how many rooms there are besides. The
    building is altogether so vast, so rich, and so beautiful, that no man on
    earth could design anything superior to it. The outside of the roof also is
    all coloured with vermilion and yellow and green and blue and other hues,
    which are fixed with a varnish so fine and exquisite that they shine like
    crystal, and lend a resplendent lustre to the Palace as seen for a great
    way round.<a id="NoteAnchor_X29" href="#Note_X29" class="fnanchor">{9}</a> This roof is made too with such strength and solidity
    that it is fit to last for ever.</p>

  <p>[On the interior side of the Palace are large buildings with halls and
    chambers, where the Emperor’s private property is placed, such as his
    treasures of gold, silver, gems, pearls, and gold plate, and in which
    reside the ladies and concubines. There he occupies himself at his own
    convenience, and no one else has access.]</p>

  <p>Between the two walls of the enclosure which I have described, there
    are fine parks and beautiful trees bearing a variety of fruits. There
    are beasts also of sundry kinds, such as white stags and fallow deer,
    gazelles and roebucks, and fine squirrels of various sorts, with numbers
    also of the animal that gives the musk, and all manner of other beautiful
    creatures,<a id="NoteAnchor_X210" href="#Note_X210" class="fnanchor">{10}</a> insomuch that the whole place is full of them, and no
    spot remains void except where there is traffic of people going and coming.
    [The parks are covered with abundant grass; and the roads through them
    being all paved and raised <span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>two cubits above the surface, they never become
    muddy, nor does the rain lodge on them, but flows off into the meadows,
    quickening the soil and producing that abundance of herbage.]</p>

  <p>From that corner of the enclosure which is towards the north-west there
    extends a fine Lake, containing foison of fish of different kinds which the
    Emperor hath caused to be put in there, so that whenever he desires any he
    can have them at his pleasure. A river enters this lake and issues from
    it, but there is a grating of iron or brass put up so that the fish cannot
    escape in that way.<a id="NoteAnchor_X211" href="#Note_X211" class="fnanchor">{11}</a></p>

  <p>Moreover on the north side of the Palace, about a bow-shot off, there is a
    hill which has been made by art [from the earth dug out of the lake]; it is
    a good hundred paces in height and a mile in compass. This hill is entirely
    covered with trees that never lose their leaves, but remain ever green.
    And I assure you that wherever a beautiful tree may exist, and the Emperor
    gets news of it, he sends for it and has it transported bodily with all its
    roots and the earth attached to them, and planted on that hill of his. No
    matter how big the tree may be, he gets it carried by his elephants; and in
    this way he has got together the most beautiful collection of trees in all
    the world. And he has also caused the whole hill to be covered with the ore
    of azure,<a id="NoteAnchor_X212" href="#Note_X212" class="fnanchor">{12}</a> which is very green. And thus not only are the trees all
    green, but the hill itself is all green likewise; and there is nothing to
    be seen on it that is not green; and hence it is called the <span class="smcap">Green Mount</span>;
    and in good sooth ’tis named well.<a id="NoteAnchor_X213" href="#Note_X213" class="fnanchor">{13}</a></p>

  <p>On the top of the hill again there is a fine big palace which is all green
    inside and out; and thus the hill, and the trees, and the palace form
    together a charming spectacle; and it is marvellous to see their uniformity
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>of colour! Everybody who sees them is delighted. And the Great Kaan had
    caused this beautiful prospect to be formed for the comfort and solace and
    delectation of his heart.</p>

  <p>You must know that beside the Palace (that we have been describing), <i>i.e.</i>
    the Great Palace, the Emperor has caused another to be built just like
    his own in every respect, and this he hath done for his son when he shall
    reign and be Emperor after him.<a id="NoteAnchor_X214" href="#Note_X214" class="fnanchor">{14}</a> Hence it is made just in the same
    fashion and of the same size, so that everything can be carried on in the
    same manner after his own death. [It stands on the other side of the lake
    from the Great Kaan’s Palace, and there is a bridge crossing the water from
    one to the other.]<a id="NoteAnchor_X215" href="#Note_X215" class="fnanchor">{15}</a> The Prince in question holds now a Seal of
    Empire, but not with such complete authority as the Great Kaan, who remains
    supreme as long as he lives.</p>

  <p>Now I am going to tell you of the chief city of Cathay, in which these
    Palaces stand; and why it was built, and how.</p>

      the gates of modern Peking. These tower-like buildings are called <em>lou</em> by
      the Chinese. It may be very likely, that at the time of Marco Polo, the
      war harness of the Khan was stored in these towers of the palace wall.

      custom is not in China peculiar to Royalty. In private houses it is usual
      to have three doors leading from the court to the guest-rooms, and there is
      a great exercise of politeness in reference to these; the guest after much
      pressing is prevailed on to enter the middle door, whilst the host enters

      square, as here, but adds, at a mile interval, a third of eight miles
      square. Now it is remarkable that Mr. A. Wylie, in a letter dated 4th
      December 1873, speaking of a recent visit to Peking, says: “I found from
      various inquiries that there are several remains of a very much larger city
      wall, inclosing the present city; but time would not allow me to follow up
      the traces.”</p>

    <p>Pauthier’s text (which I have corrected by the G.&nbsp;T.), after describing the
      <em>outer inclosure</em> to be a <em>mile every way</em>, says that the inner inclosure
      lay at <em>an interval of a mile within it</em>!</p>

    <p>[Dr. Bretschneider observes “that in the ancient Chinese works, three
      concentric inclosures are mentioned in connection with the palace. The
      innermost inclosed the <em>Ta-nei</em>, the middle inclosure, called <em>Kung-ch’eng</em>
      or <em>Huang-ch’eng</em>, answering to the wall surrounding the present prohibited
      city, and was about 6 <i>li</i> in circuit. Besides this there was an outer
      wall (a rampart apparently) 20 <i>li</i> in circuit, answering to the wall
      of the present imperial city (which now has 18 <i>li</i> in circuit).” The
      <em>Huang-ch’eng</em> of the Yuen was measured by imperial order, and found to be
      7 <i>li</i> in circuit; the wall of the Mongol palace was 6 <i>li</i> in circuit,
      according to the <em>Ch’ue keng lu</em>. (<cite>Bretschneider, Peking</cite>, 24.)—Marco
      Polo’s mile could be approximately estimated = 2·77 Chinese <i>li</i>. (<i>Ibid.</i>
      24, note.) The common Chinese <i>li</i> = 360 <i>pu</i>, or 180 <i>chang</i>, or 1800 <i>ch’i</i>
      (feet); 1 <i>li</i> = 1894 English feet or 575 mètres; at least according to the
      old Venice measures quoted in <cite>Yule’s Marco Polo</cite>, II., one pace = 5 feet.
      Besides the common <i>li</i>, the Chinese have another <i>li</i>, used for measuring
      fields, which has only 240 <i>pu</i> or 1200 <i>ch’i</i>. This is the <i>li</i> spoken of
      in the <cite>Ch’ue keng lu</cite>. (<i>Ibid.</i> 13, note.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_X28" href="#NoteAnchor_X28" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 8.</a>—This description of palace (see opposite cut), an elevated basement
      of masonry with a superstructure of timber (in general carved and gilded),
      is still found in Burma, Siam, and Java, as well as in China. If we had
      any trace of the palaces of the ancient Asokas and Vikramadityas of India,
      we should probably find that they were of the same character. It seems to
      be one of those things that belonged to some ancient Panasiatic fashion,
      as the palaces of Nineveh were of a somewhat similar construction. In the
      Audience Halls of the Moguls at Delhi and Agra we can trace the ancient
      form, though the superstructure has there become an arcade of marble
      instead of a pavilion on timber columns.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span></p>

    <p>[“The <em>Ta-ming tien</em> (Hall of great brightness) is without doubt what Marco
      Polo calls ‘the Lord’s Great Palace.’... He states, that it ‘hath no upper
      story’; and indeed, the palace buildings which the Chinese call <em>tien</em> are
      always of one story. Polo speaks also of a ‘very fine pillared balustrade’
      (the <em>chu lang</em>, pillared verandah, of the Chinese author). Marco Polo
      states that the basement of the great palace ‘is raised some ten palms
      above the surrounding soil.’ We find in the <cite>Ku kung i lu</cite>: ‘The basement
      of the Ta-ming tien is raised about 10 <i>ch’i</i> above the soil.’ There can
      also be no doubt that the Ta-ming tien stood at about the same place where
      now the <em>T’ai-ho tien</em>, the principal hall of the palace, is situated.”

    <p>The <cite>Ch’ue keng lu</cite>, translated by Bretschneider, 25, contains long
      articles devoted to the description of the palace of the Mongols and the
      adjacent palace grounds. They are too long to be reproduced here.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      colours, when you catch a distant view of them at sunrise, as I have done
      many a time, you would think them all made of, or at least covered with,
      pure gold enamelled in azure and green, so that the spectacle is at once
      majestic and charming.” (<cite>Magaillans</cite>, p. 353.)</p>

      <em>Wan-sui shan</em>, “in which rare birds and beasts are kept. Before the
      Emperor goes to Shangtu, the officers are accustomed to be entertained at
      this place.” (<cite>Ch’ue keng lu</cite>, quoted by Bretschneider, 36.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_X211" href="#NoteAnchor_X211" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 11.</a>—“On the west side, where the space is amplest, there is a lake
      very full of fish. It is in the form of a fiddle, and is an Italian mile
      and a quarter in length. It is crossed at the narrowest part, which
      corresponds to gates in the walls, by a handsome bridge, the extremities
      of which are adorned by two triumphal arches of three openings each....
      The lake is surrounded by palaces and pleasure houses, built partly in the
      water and partly on shore, and charming boats are provided on it for the
      use of the Emperor when he chooses to go a-fishing or to take an airing.”
      (<i>Ibid.</i> 282–283.) The marble bridge, as it now exists, consists of nine
      arches, and is 600 feet long. (<cite>Rennie’s Peking</cite>, II. 57.)</p>

    <p>Ramusio specifies another lake in the <em>city</em>, fed by the same stream before
      it enters the palace, and used by the public for watering cattle.</p>

    <p>[“The lake which Marco Polo saw is the same as the <em>T’ai-yi ch’i</em> of our
      days. It has, however, changed a little in its form. This lake and also its
      name <em>T’ai-yi ch’i</em> date from the twelfth century, at which time an Emperor
      of the Kin first gave orders to collect together the water of some springs
      in the hills, where now the summer palaces stand, and to conduct it to a
      place north of his capital, where pleasure gardens were laid out. The river
      which enters the lake and issues from it exists still, under its ancient
      name <em>Kin-shui</em>.” (<cite>Bretschneider, Peking</cite>, 34.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      12.</a>—The expression here is in the Geog. Text, “<span lang="fr"><i>Roze</i> de <i>l’açur</i></span>,” and
      in Pauthier’s “<i lang="fr">de rose et de l’asur</i>.” <em>Rose Minerale</em>, in the terminology
      of the alchemists, was a red powder produced in the sublimation of gold
      and mercury, but I can find no elucidation of the term Rose of Azure. The
      Crusca Italian has in the same place <i lang="it">Terra dello Azzurro</i>. Having ventured
      to refer the question to the high authority of Mr. C. W. King, he expresses
      the opinion that <em>Roze</em> here stands for <em>Roche</em>, and that probably the
      term <i lang="fr">Roche de l’azur</i> may have been used loosely for <em>blue-stone</em>, <i>i.e.</i>
      carbonate of copper, which would assume a green colour through moisture. He
      adds: “Nero, according to Pliny, actually used <em>chrysocolla</em>, the siliceous
      carbonate of copper, in powder, for strewing the circus, to give the course
      the colour of his favourite faction, the <em>prasine</em> (or green). There may be
      some analogy between this device and that of Kúblái Khan.” This parallel is
      a very happy one.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_X213" href="#NoteAnchor_X213" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 13.</a>—Friar Odoric gives a description, short, but closely agreeing in
      substance with that in the Text, of the Palace, the Park, the Lake, and the
      Green Mount.</p>

    <p>A green mount, answering to the description, and about 160 feet in height,
      stands immediately in rear of the palace buildings. It is called by the
      Chinese <em>King-Shan</em>, “Court Mountain,” <em>Wan-su-Shan</em>, “Ten Thousand Year
      Mount,” and <em>Mei-Shan</em>, “Coal Mount,” the last from the material of which
      it is traditionally said to be composed (as a provision of fuel in case
      of siege).<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Whether this is
      Kúblái’s Green Mount does not seem to be
      quite certain. Dr. Lockhart tells me that, according to the information he
      collected when living at Peking, it is not so, but was formed by the Ming
      Emperors from the excavation of the existing lake on the site which the
      Mongol Palace had occupied. There is another mount, he adds, adjoining the
      east shore of the lake, which must be of older date even than Kúblái, for a
      Dagoba standing on it is ascribed to the <em>Kin</em>.</p>

    <p>[The “Green Mount” was an island called <em>K’iung-hua</em> at the time of the
      Kin; in 1271 it received the name of <em>Wan-sui shan</em>; it is about 100 feet
      in height, and is the only hill mentioned by Chinese writers of the Mongol
      time who refer to the palace grounds. It is not the present <em>King-shan</em>,
      north of the palace, called also <em>Wan-sui-shan</em> under the Ming, and now the
      <em>Mei-shan</em>, of more recent formation. “I have no doubt,” says Bretschneider
      (<cite>Peking</cite>, <i>l.c.</i> 35), “that Marco Polo’s handsome palace on the top of the
      Green Mount is the same as the <em>Kuang-han tien</em>” of the <cite>Ch’ue keng lu</cite>. It
      was a hall in which there was a jar of black jade, big enough to hold more
      than 30 piculs of wine; this jade had white veins, and in accordance with
      these veins, fish and animals have been carved on the jar. (<i>Ibid.</i> 35.) “The
      <cite>Ku kung i lu</cite>, in describing the <em>Wan-sui-shan</em>, praises the beautiful
      shady green of the vegetation there.” (<i>Ibid.</i> 37.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[“Near the eastern end of the bridge (<em>Kin-ao yü-tung</em> which crosses the
      lake) the visitor sees a circular wall, which is called <em>yüan ch’eng</em>
      (round wall). It is about 350 paces in circuit. Within it is an imperial
      building <em>Ch’eng-kuang tien</em>, dating from the Mongol time. From this
      circular enclosure, another long and beautifully executed marble bridge
      leads northwards, to a charming hill, covered with shady trees, and capped
      by a magnificent white <em>suburga</em>.” (<cite>Bretschneider</cite>, p. 22.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>In a plate attached to next chapter, I have drawn, on a small scale, the
      existing cities of Peking, as compared with the Mongol and Chinese cities
      in the time of Kúblái. The plan of the latter has been constructed (1)
      from existing traces, as exhibited in the Russian Survey republished by
      our War Office; (2) from information kindly afforded by Dr. Lockhart;
      and (3) from Polo’s description and a few slight notices by Gaubil and
      others. It will be seen, even on the small scale of these plans, that
      the general arrangement of the palace, the park, the lakes (including
      that in the city, which appears in Ramusio’s version), the bridge, the
      mount, etc., in the existing Peking, very closely correspond with Polo’s
      indications; and I think the strong probability is that the Ming really
      built on the old traces, and that the lake, mount, etc., as they now
      stand, are substantially those of the Great Mongol, though Chinese policy
      or patriotism may have spread the belief that the foreign traces were
      obliterated. Indeed, if that belief were true, the Mongol Palace must
      have been very much out of the axis of the City of Kúblái, which is in
      the highest degree improbable. The <cite>Bulletin de la Soc. de Géographie</cite>
      for September 1873, contains a paper on Peking by the physician to the
      French Embassy there. Whatever may be the worth of the meteorological and
      hygienic details in that paper, I am bound to say that the historical and
      topographical part is so inaccurate as to be of no value.</p>

      <i>ch’i</i> long and 22 broad, leads eastward to the wall of the Imperial
      Palace. A third bridge, a wooden draw-bridge 470 <i>ch’i</i> long, stretches to
      the west over the lake to its western border, where the palace <em>Hing-sheng

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the City of Cambaluc.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> there was on that spot in old times a great and noble city called
    <span class="smcap">Cambaluc</span>, which is as much as to say in our tongue “The city of the
    Emperor.”<a id="NoteAnchor_XI21" href="#Note_XI21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> But the Great Kaan was informed by his Astrologers that
    this city would prove rebellious, and raise great disorders against his
    imperial authority. So he caused the present city to be built close beside
    the old one, with only a river between them.<a id="NoteAnchor_XI22" href="#Note_XI22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> And he caused the
    people of the old city to be removed to the new town that he had founded;
    and this is called <span class="smcap">Taidu</span>. [However, he allowed a portion of the people
    which he did not suspect to remain in the old city, because the new one
    could not hold the whole of them, big as it is.]</p>

  <p>As regards the size of this (new) city you must know that it has a compass
    of 24 miles, for each side of it hath a length of 6 miles, and it is
    four-square. And it is all walled round with walls of earth which have
    a thickness of full ten paces at bottom, and a height of more than 10
    paces;<a id="NoteAnchor_XI23" href="#Note_XI23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> but they are not so thick at top, for they diminish in
    thickness as they rise, so that at top they are only about 3 paces thick.
    And they are provided throughout with loop-holed battlements, which are all
    whitewashed.</p>

  <p>There are 12 gates, and over each gate there is a great and handsome
    palace, so that there are on each side of the square three gates and five
    palaces; for (I ought to mention) there is at each angle also a great and
    handsome palace. In those palaces are vast halls in which are kept the arms
    of the city garrison.<a id="NoteAnchor_XI24" href="#Note_XI24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>The streets are so straight and wide that you can <span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>see right along them from
    end to end and from one gate to the other. And up and down the city there
    are beautiful palaces, and many great and fine hostelries, and fine houses
    in great numbers. [All the plots of ground on which the houses of the city
    are built are four-square, and laid out with straight lines; all the plots
    being occupied by great and spacious palaces, with courts and gardens of
    proportionate size. All these plots were assigned to different heads of
    families. Each square plot is encompassed by handsome streets for traffic;
    and thus the whole city is arranged in squares just like a chess-board, and
    disposed in a manner so perfect and masterly that it is impossible to give
    a description that should do it justice.]<a id="NoteAnchor_XI25" href="#Note_XI25" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>Moreover, in the middle of the city there is a great clock—that is to say,
    a bell—which is struck at night. And after it has struck three times no one
    must go out in the city, unless it be for the needs of a woman in labour,
    or of the sick.<a id="NoteAnchor_XI26" href="#Note_XI26" class="fnanchor">{6}</a> And those who go about on such errands are bound to
    carry lanterns with them. Moreover, the established guard at each gate of
    the city is 1000 armed men; not that you are to imagine this guard is kept
    up for fear of any attack, but only as a guard of honour for the Sovereign,
    who resides there, and to prevent thieves from doing mischief in the
    town.<a id="NoteAnchor_XI27" href="#Note_XI27" class="fnanchor">{7}</a></p>

      the T’sin Dynasty. [Under the T’ang dynasty (618–907) it was known under
      the name of Yu-chau.] It became one of the capitals of the Khitans in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
      936, and of the Kin sovereigns, who took it in 1125, in 1151 under the name
      of Chung-tu. Under the name of Yenking, [given to this city in 1013] it has
      a conspicuous place in the wars of Chinghiz against the latter dynasty. He
      captured it in 1215. In 1264, Kúblái adopted it as his chief residence,
      and founded in 1267, the new city of <span class="smcap">Tatu</span> (“Great Court”), called by the
      Mongols <span class="smcap">Taidu</span> or <span class="smcap">Daitu
      </span> since 1271 (see <a href="#Note_LXI11">Bk. I. ch. lxi. note 1</a>), at a little
      distance—Odoric says half a mile—to the north-east of the old Yenking. Tatu
      was completed in the summer of 1267.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span></p>

    <p>Old Yenking had, when occupied by the Kin, a circuit of 27 <i>li</i> (commonly
      estimated at 9 miles, but in early works the <i>li</i> is not more than ⅕ of a
      mile), afterwards increased to 30 <i>li</i>. But there was some kind of outer
      wall about the city and its suburbs, the circuit of which is called 75
      <i>li</i>. [“At the time of the Yuen the walls still existed, and the ancient
      city of the Kin was commonly called Nan-ch’eng (Southern city), whilst the
      Mongol capital was termed the northern city.” <cite>Bretschneider, Peking</cite>,

    <p>The existing Tartar city of Peking (technically <em>Neï-ch’ing</em>, “The Interior
      City,” or <em>King-ch’ing</em>, “City of the Court”) stands on the site of
      Taidu, and represents it. After the expulsion of the Mongols (1368) the
      new native Dynasty of Ming established their capital at Nanking. But this
      was found so inconvenient that the third sovereign of the Dynasty re-occupied Taidu
      or Cambaluc, the repairs of which began in 1409. He reduced
      it in size by cutting off nearly a third part of the city at the north
      end. The remains of this abandoned portion of wall are, however, still in
      existence, approaching 30 feet in height all round. This old wall is called
      by the Chinese <em>The Wall of the Yuen</em> (<i>i.e.</i> the Mongol Dynasty), and it is
      laid down in the Russian Survey. [The capital of the Ming was 40 <i>li</i> in
      circuit, according to the <cite>Ch’ang an k’o hua</cite>.] The existing walls were
      built, or restored rather (the north wall being in any case, of course,
      entirely new), in 1437. There seems to be no doubt that the present south
      front of the Tartar city was the south front of Taidu. The whole outline of
      Taidu is therefore still extant, and easily measurable. If the scale on the
      War Office edition of the Russian Survey be correct, the long sides measure
      close upon 5 miles and 500 yards; the short sides, 3 miles and 1200 yards.
      Hence the whole perimeter was just about 18 English miles, or less than
      16 Italian miles. If, however, a pair of compasses be run round Taidu and
      Yenking (as we have laid the latter down from such data as could be had)
      <em>together</em>, the circuit will be something like 24 Italian miles, and this
      may have to do with Polo’s error.</p>

    <p>[“The <cite>Yuen shi</cite> states that <em>Ta-tu</em> was 60 <i>li</i> in circumference. The
      <cite>Ch’ue keng lu</cite>, a work published at the close of the Yuen Dynasty, gives
      the same number of <i>li</i> for the circuit of the capital, but explains that
      <i>li</i> of 240 <i>pu</i> each are meant. If this statement be correct, it would
      give only 40 common or geographical <i>li</i> for the circuit of the Mongol
      town.” (<cite>Bretschneider</cite>, <cite>Peking</cite>, 13.) Dr. Bretschneider writes (p. 20):
      “The outlines of Khanbaligh, partly in contradiction with the ancient
      Chinese records, if my view be correct, would have measured about 50 common
      <i>li</i> in circuit (13 <i>li</i> and more from north to south, 11·64 from east to
      west.”)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Polo [and Odoric] again says that there were 12 gates—3 to every side.
      Both Gaubil and Martini also say that there were 12 gates. But I believe
      that both are trusting to Marco. There are 9 gates in the present Tartar
      city—viz. 3 on the south side and 2 on each of the other sides. The old
      Chinese accounts say there were 11 gates in Taidu. (See <cite>Amyot</cite>, <cite>Mém.</cite> II.
      553.) I have in my plan, therefore, assumed that one gate on the east and
      one on the west were obliterated in the reduction of the <em>enceinte</em> by the
      Ming. But I must observe that Mr. Lockhart tells me he did not find the
      traces of gates in those positions, whilst the 2 gates on the <em>north</em> side
      of the old Mongol rampart are quite distinct, with the barbicans in front,
      and the old Mongol bridge over the ditch still serving for the public
      thoroughfare.<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>[“The <cite>Yuen shi</cite> as well as the <cite>Ch’ue keng lu</cite>, and other works of
      the Yuen, agree in stating that the capital had eleven gates. They are
      enumerated in the following order: Southern wall—(1) The gate direct
      south (mid.) was called <em>Li-cheng men</em>; (2) the gate to the left (east),
      <em>Wen-ming men</em>; (3) the gate to the right (west), <em>Shun-ch’eng men</em>.
      Eastern wall—(4) The gate direct east (mid.), <em>Ch’ung-jen men</em>; (5) the
      gate to the south-east, <em>Ts’i-hua men</em>; (6) the gate to the north-east,
      <em>Kuang-hi men</em>. Western wall—(7) The gate direct west (mid.), <em>Ho-i men</em>;
      (8) the gate to the south-west, <em>P’ing-tse men</em>; (9) the gate to the
      north-west, <em>Su-ts’ing men</em>. Northern Wall—(10) The gate to the north-west,
      <em>K’ien-te men</em>; (11) the gate to the north-east, <em>An-chen men</em>.”
      (<cite>Bretschneider</cite>, <cite>Peking</cite>, 13–14.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>When the Ming established themselves on the old Mongol site, population
      seems to have gathered close about the southern wall, probably using
      material from the remains of Yenking. This excrescence was inclosed by a
      new wall in 1554, and was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>called the “Outer Town.” It is what is called
      by Europeans the <em>Chinese City</em>. Its western wall exhibits in the base
      sculptured stones, which seem to have belonged to the old palace of
      Yenking. Some traces of Yenking still existed in Gaubil’s time; the only
      relic of it now pointed out is a pagoda outside of the Kwang-An-Măn, or
      western gate of the Outer City, marked in the War Office edition of the
      Russian Map as “Tower.” (Information from <cite>Dr. Lockhart.</cite>)</p>

    <p>The “Great Palaces” over the gates and at the corner bastions are no doubt
      well illustrated by the buildings which still occupy those positions. There
      are two such lofty buildings at each of the gates of the modern city, the
      outer one (shown on <a href="#i376">p. 376</a>) forming an elevated redoubt.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XI25" href="#NoteAnchor_XI25" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—The French writer cited under note 3 says of the city as it stands:
      <span lang="fr">“La ville est de la sorte coupée en échiquier à peu près régulier dont les
      quadres circonscrits par des larges avenues sont percés eux-mêmes d’une
      multitude de rues et ruelles ... qui toutes à peu près sont orientées N. et
      S., E. et O. Une seule volonté a évidemment présidé à ce plan, et jamais
      édilité n’a eu à exécuter d’un seul coup aussi vaste entreprise.”</span></p>

    <p><a id="Note_XI26" href="#NoteAnchor_XI26" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 6.</a>—Martini speaks of the public clock-towers in the Chinese cities,
      which in his time were furnished with water-clocks. A watchman struck
      the hour on a great gong, at the same time exhibiting the hour in large
      characters. The same person watched for fires, and summoned the public with
      his gong to aid in extinguishing them.</p>

    <p>[The Rev. G. B. Farthing mentions (<cite>North-China Herald</cite>, 7th September,
      1884) at T’ai-yuen fu the remains of an object in the bell-tower, which
      was, and is still known, as one of the eight wonders of this city; it is a
      vessel of brass, a part of a water-clock from which water formerly used to
      flow down upon a drum beneath and mark off time into equal divisions.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>The tower indicated by Marco appears still to exist. It occupies the place
      which I have marked as Alarm Tower in the plan of Taidu. It was erected
      in 1272, but probably rebuilt on the Ming occupation of the city. [“The
      <cite>Yuen yi t’ung chi</cite>, or ‘Geography of the Mongol Empire’ records: ‘In the
      year 1272, the bell-tower and the drum-tower were built in the <em>middle</em> of
      the capital.’ A bell-tower (<em>chung-lou</em>) and a drum-tower (<em>ku-lou</em>) exist
      still in Peking, in the northern part of the Tartar City. The <em>ku-lou</em> is
      the same as that built in the thirteenth century, but the bell-tower dates
      only from the last century. The bell-tower of the Yuen was a little to the
      east of the drum-tower, where now the temple <em>Wan-ning sse</em> stands. This
      temple is nearly in the middle of the position I (Bretschneider) assign
      to Khanbaligh.” (<cite>Bretschneider, Peking</cite>, 20.)—H.&nbsp;C.] In the Court of the
      Old Observatory at Peking there is preserved, with a few other ancient
      instruments, which date from the Mongol era, a very elaborate water-clock,
      provided with four copper basins embedded in brickwork, and rising in steps
      one above the other. A cut of this courtyard, with its instruments and
      aged trees, also ascribed to the Mongol time, will be found in <a href="#i454">ch. xxxiii.</a>

  <div class="subh4">How the Great Kaan Maintains a Guard of Twelve Thousand Horse, which are
    called Keshican.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span>You</span> must know that the Great Kaan, to maintain his state, hath a guard of
    twelve thousand horsemen, who are styled <span class="smcap">Keshican</span>, which is as much as to
    say “Knights devoted to their Lord.” Not that he keeps these for fear of
    any man whatever, but merely because of his own exalted dignity. These
    12,000 men have four captains, each of whom is in command of 3000; and each
    body of 3000 takes a turn of three days and nights to guard the palace,
    where they also take their meals. After the expiration of three days and
    nights they are relieved by another 3000, who mount guard for the same
    space of time, and then another body takes its turn, so that there are
    always 3000 on guard. Thus it goes until the whole 12,000, who are styled
    (as I said) Keshican, have been on duty; and then the tour begins again,
    and so runs on from year’s end to year’s end.<a id="NoteAnchor_XII21" href="#Note_XII21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XII21" href="#NoteAnchor_XII21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      1.</a>—I have <em>deduced</em> a reading for the word <em>Quescican</em> (Keshican),
      which is not found precisely in any text. Pauthier reads <em>Questiau</em> and
      <em>Quesitau</em>; the G. Text has <em>Quesitam</em> and <em>Quecitain</em>; the Crusca <em>Questi
      Tan</em>; Ramusio, <em>Casitan</em>; the Riccardiana, <em>Quescitam</em>. Recollecting the
      constant clerical confusion between <em>c</em> and <em>t</em>, what follows will leave no
      doubt I think that the true reading to which all these variations point is
      <em>Quescican</em>.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>In the Institutes of Ghazan Khan, we find established among other
      formalities for the authentication of the royal orders, that they should be
      stamped on the back, in black ink, with the seals of the <em>Four Commanders</em>
      of the <em>Four Kiziks</em>, or <em>Corps of the Life Guard</em>.</p>

    <p>Wassáf also, in detailing the different classes of the great dignitaries
      of the Mongol monarchy, names (1) the <em>Noyáns</em> of the Ulus, or princes
      of the blood; (2) the great chiefs of the tribes; (3) the <em>Amírs of the
      four Keshik</em>, or <em>Corps of the Body Guard</em>; (4) the officers of the army,
      commanding ten thousands, thousands, and so on.</p>

    <p>Moreover, in Rashiduddin, we find the identical plural form used by our
      author. He says that, after the sack of Baghdad, Hulaku, who had escaped
      from the polluted atmosphere of the city, sent “Ilká Noyán and Ḳarábúgá,
      with 3000 Moghul horse <span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>into Baghdad, in order to have the buildings
      repaired, and to put things generally in order. These chiefs posted
      sentries from the <span class="smcap">Kishíkán</span> (<span lang="ar">كشي كان</span>), and from their own followings in the
      different quarters of the town, had the carcases of beasts removed from the
      streets, and caused the bazaars to be rebuilt.”</p>

    <p>We find <em>Kishik</em> still used at the court of Hindustan, under the great
      kings of Timur’s House, for the corps on tour of duty at the palace; and
      even for the sets of matchlocks and sabres, which were changed weekly from
      Akbar’s armoury for the royal use. The royal guards in Persia, who watch
      the king’s person at night, are termed <em>Keshikchi</em>, and their captain
      <em>Keshikchi Bashi</em>. [“On the night of the 11th of Jemady ul Sany, <span class="allsmcap">A.H.</span> 1160
      (or 8th June, 1747), near the city of Khojoon, three days’ journey from
      Meshed, Mohammed Kuly Khan Ardemee, who was of the same tribe with Nadir
      Shah, his relation, and Kushukchee Bashee, with seventy of the <em>Kukshek</em> or
      guard, ... bound themselves by an oath to assassinate Nadir Shah.” (<cite>Memoirs
      of Khojeh Abdulkurreem ... transl. by F. Gladwin</cite>, Calcutta, 1788, pp.
      166–167).]</p>

    <p>Friar Odoric speaks of the four barons who kept watch by the Great Kaan’s
      side as the <em>Cuthé</em>, which probably represents the Chinese form <em>Kiesie</em>
      (as in De Mailla), or <em>Kuesie</em> (as in Gaubil). The latter applies the term
      to four devoted champions of Chinghiz, and their descendants, who were
      always attached to the Kaan’s body-guard, and he identifies them with the
      <em>Quesitan</em> of Polo, or rather with the captains of the latter; adding
      expressly that the word <em>Kuesie</em> is Mongol.</p>

    <p>I see <em>Kishik</em> is a proper name among the Kalmak chiefs; and <em>Keshikten</em>
      also is the name of a Mongol tribe, whose territory lies due north of
      Peking, near the old site of Shangtu. (<a href="#CHAPTER_LXI1">Bk. I. ch. lxi.</a>) [<cite>Keshikhteng</cite>,
      a tribe (<i>pu</i>; mong. <em>aimak</em>) of the Chao Uda League (<em>mêng</em>; mong.
      <em>chogolgân</em>) among the twenty-four tribes of the <em>Nei Mung-ku</em> (Inner
      Mongols). (See <cite>Mayers’ Chinese Government</cite>, p. 81.)—H.&nbsp;C.] In Kovalevsky,
      I find the following:—</p>

    <p>(No. 2459) “<em>Keshik</em>, grace, favour, bounty, benefit, good fortune,
      charity.”</p>

    <p>(No. 2461) “<em>Keshikten</em>, fortunate, happy, blessed.”</p>

    <p>(No. 2541) “<em>Kichyeku</em>, to be zealous, assiduous, devoted.”</p>

    <p>(No. 2588) “<em>Kushiku</em>, to hinder, to bar the way to,” etc.</p>

    <p>The third of these corresponds closely with Polo’s etymology of “knights
      devoted to their lord,” but perhaps either the first or the last may afford
      the real derivation.</p>

    <p>In spite of the different initials (<span lang="ar">ق</span> instead of <span lang="ar">ک</span>), it can
      scarcely be doubted that the <em>Ḳalchi</em> and <em>Ḳalaḳchi</em> of Timur’s Institutes
      are mere mistranscriptions of the same word, <i>e.g.</i>: “I ordered that 12,000
      <em>Ḳalchi</em>, men of the sword completely armed, should be cantoned in the
      Palace; to the right and to the left, to the front, and in the rear of the
      imperial diwán; thus, that 1000 of those 12,000 should be every night upon
      guard,” etc. The translator’s note says of <em>Ḳalchi</em>, “A Mogul word supposed
      to mean <em>guards</em>.” We see that even the traditional number of 12,000, and
      its division into four brigades, are maintained. (See <cite>Timour’s Inst.</cite>, pp.
      299 and 235, 237.)</p>

    <p>I must add that Professor Vámbéry does not assent to the form <em>Keshikán</em>,
      on the ground that this Persian plural is impossible in an old Tartar
      dialect, and he supposes the true word to be <em>Kechilan</em> or <em>Kechiklen</em>,
      “the night-watchers,” from <em>Kiche</em> or <em>Kichek</em> (Chag. and Uighúr), =
      “night.”</p>

    <p>I believe, however, that Persian was the colloquial language of foreigners
      at the Kaan’s court, who would not scruple to make a Persian plural when
      wanted; whilst Rashid has exemplified the actual use of this one.</p>

    <p>[“By <em>Keshican</em> in <cite>Colonel Yule’s Marco Polo</cite>, <em>Keshikten</em> is evidently
      meant. This is a general Mongol term to designate the Khan’s lifeguard.
      It is derived from the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>word <em>Keshik</em>, meaning a guard by turns; a corps
      on tour of duty. <em>Keshik</em> is one of the archaisms of the Mongol language,
      for now this word has another meaning in Mongol. Colonel Yule has brought
      together several explanations of the term. It seems to me that among his
      suppositions the following is the most consistent with the ancient meaning
      of the word:—</p>

    <p>“We find <em>Kishik</em> still used at the court of Hindustan, under the great
      kings of Timur’s House, for the corps on tour of duty at the palace.... The
      royal guards in Persia, who watch the King’s person at night, are termed
      <em>Keshikchi</em>.”</p>

    <p>“The Keshikten was divided into a day-watch called <em>Turgaut</em> and a
      night-watch <em>Kebteul</em>. The Kebte-ul consisted of pure Mongols, whilst the
      Turgaut was composed of the sons of the vassal princes and governors of
      the provinces, and of hostages. The watch of the Khan was changed every
      three days, and contained 400 men. In 1330 it was reduced to 100 men.”
      (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 42–43.) Mr. E. H. Parker writes in the <cite>China Review</cite>, XVIII.
      p. 262, that they “are evidently the ‘body guards’ of the modern viceroys,
      now pronounced Kashïha, but, evidently, originally <em>Kêshigha</em>.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">And</span> when the Great Kaan sits at table on any great court occasion, it is
    in this fashion. His table is elevated a good deal above the others, and
    he sits at the north end of the hall, looking towards the south, with
    his chief wife beside him on the left. On his right sit his sons and his
    nephews, and other kinsmen of the Blood Imperial, but lower, so that their
    heads are on a level with the Emperor’s feet. And then the other Barons
    sit at other tables lower still. So also with the women; for all the wives
    of the Lord’s sons, and of his nephews and other kinsmen, sit at the lower
    table to his right; and below them again the ladies of the other Barons and
    Knights, each in the place assigned by the Lord’s orders. The tables are
    so disposed that the Emperor can see the whole of them from end to end,
    many as they are.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIII21" href="#Note_XIII21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> [Further, you are not to suppose that everybody
    sits at table; on the contrary, the greater part of the soldiers and their

    will be found more than 40,000 people; for there is a great concourse of
    folk bringing presents to the Lord, or come from foreign countries with
    curiosities.</p>

  <p>In a certain part of the hall near where the Great Kaan holds his table,
    there [is set a large and very beautiful piece of workmanship in the form
    of a square coffer, or buffet, about three paces each way, exquisitely
    wrought with figures of animals, finely carved and gilt. The middle is
    hollow, and in it] stands a great vessel of pure gold, holding as much
    as an ordinary butt; and at each corner of the great vessel is one of
    smaller size [of the capacity of a firkin], and from the former the wine
    or beverage flavoured with fine and costly spices is drawn off into the
    latter. [And on the buffet aforesaid are set all the Lord’s drinking
    vessels, among which are certain pitchers of the finest gold,] which are
    called <em>verniques</em>,<a id="NoteAnchor_XIII22" href="#Note_XIII22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> and are big enough to hold drink for eight or
    ten persons. And one of these is put between every two persons, besides a
    couple of golden cups with handles, so that every man helps himself from
    the pitcher that stands between him and his neighbour. And the ladies are
    supplied in the same way. The value of these pitchers and cups is something
    immense; in fact, the Great Kaan has such a quantity of this kind of plate,
    and of gold and silver in other shapes, as no one ever before saw or heard
    tell of, or could believe.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIII23" href="#Note_XIII23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>[There are certain Barons specially deputed to see that foreigners, who
    do not know the customs of the Court, are provided with places suited to
    their rank; and these Barons are continually moving to and fro in the hall,
    looking to the wants of the guests at table, and causing the servants to
    supply them promptly with wine, milk, meat, or whatever they lack. At every
    door of the hall (or, indeed, wherever the Emperor may be) <span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>there stand a
    couple of big men like giants, one on each side, armed with staves. Their
    business is to see that no one steps upon the threshold in entering, and if
    this does happen, they strip the offender of his clothes, and he must pay
    a forfeit to have them back again; or in lieu of taking his clothes, they
    give him a certain number of blows. If they are foreigners ignorant of the
    order, then there are Barons appointed to introduce them, and explain it
    to them. They think, in fact, that it brings bad luck if any one touches
    the threshold. Howbeit, they are not expected to stick at this in going
    forth again, for at that time some are like to be the worse for liquor, and
    incapable of looking to their steps.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIII24" href="#Note_XIII24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a>]</p>

  <p>And you must know that those who wait upon the Great Kaan with his dishes
    and his drink are some of the great Barons. They have the mouth and nose
    muffled with fine napkins of silk and gold, so that no breath nor odour
    from their persons should taint the dish or the goblet presented to the
    Lord. And when the Emperor is going to drink, all the musical instruments,
    of which he has vast store of every kind, begin to play. And when he takes
    the cup all the Barons and the rest of the company drop on their knees and
    make the deepest obeisance before him, and then the Emperor doth drink. But
    each time that he does so the whole ceremony is repeated.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIII25" href="#Note_XIII25" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>I will say nought about the dishes, as you may easily conceive that there
    is a great plenty of every possible kind. But you should know that in every
    case where a Baron or Knight dines at those tables, their wives also dine
    there with the other ladies. And when all have dined and the tables have
    been removed, then come in a great number of players and jugglers, adepts
    at all sorts of wonderful feats,<a id="NoteAnchor_XIII26" href="#Note_XIII26" class="fnanchor">{6}</a> and perform before the Emperor
    and the rest of the company, creating great <span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>diversion and mirth, so that
    everybody is full of laughter and enjoyment. And when the performance is
    over, the company breaks up and every one goes to his quarters.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIII21" href="#NoteAnchor_XIII21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—We are to conceive of rows of small tables, at each of which were
      set probably but two guests. This seems to be the modern Chinese practice,
      and to go back to some very old accounts of the Tartar nations. Such tables
      we find in use in the tenth century, at the court of the King of Bolghar
      (see <a href="#Note_IIp2"><i>Prologue</i>, note 2, ch. ii.</a>), and at the Chinese entertainments to
      Shah Rukh’s embassy in the fifteenth century. Megasthenes described the
      guests at an Indian banquet as having a table set before each individual.

    <p><a id="Note_XIII22" href="#NoteAnchor_XIII22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—This word (G.&nbsp;T. and Ram.) is in the Crusca Italian transformed
      into an adjective, “<em>vaselle</em> vernicate <em>d’oro</em>,” and both Marsden and
      Pauthier have substantially adopted the same interpretation, which
      seems to me in contradiction with the text. In Pauthier’s text the word
      is <em>vernigal</em>, pl. <em>vernigaux</em>, which he explains, I know not on what
      authority, as “<i lang="fr">coupes sans anses vernies ou laquées d’or</i>.” There is,
      indeed, a Venetian sea-term, <em>Vernegal</em>, applied to a wooden bowl in which
      the food of a mess is put, and it seems possible that this word may have
      been substituted for the unknown <em>Vernique</em>. I suspect the latter was some
      Oriental term, but I can find nothing nearer than the Persian <em>Bărni</em>, Ar.
      <em>Al-Bărníya</em>, <span lang="la">“vas fictile in quo quid recondunt,”</span> whence the Spanish word
      <em>Albornia</em>, “a great glazed vessel in the shape of a bowl, with handles.”
      So far as regards the form, the change of <em>Barniya</em> into <em>Vernique</em> would
      be quite analogous to that change of <em>Hundwáníy</em> into <em>Ondanique</em>, which we
      have already met with. (See <cite>Dozy et Engelmann, Glos. des Mots Espagnols</cite>,

    <p>Dr. Bretschneider (<cite>Peking</cite>, 28) mentions “a large jar made of wood and
      <em>varnished</em>, the inside lined with silver,” and he adds in a note “perhaps
      this statement may serve to explain Marco Polo’s <em>verniques</em> or <em>vaselle</em>
      vernicate <em>d’oro</em>, big enough to hold drink for eight or ten persons.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>A few lines above we have “of the capacity of a <em>firkin</em>.” The word is
      <em>bigoncio</em>, which is explained in the <cite>Vocab. Univ. Ital.</cite> as a kind of
      tub used in the vintage, and containing 3 <em>mine</em>, each of half a <em>stajo</em>.
      This seems to point to the <em>Tuscan</em> mina, or half stajo, which is = ⅓ of a
      bushel. Hence the <em>bigoncio</em> would = a bushel, or, in old liquid measure,
      about a firkin.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIII23" href="#NoteAnchor_XIII23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—A buffet, with flagons of liquor and goblets, was an essential
      feature in the public halls or tents of the Mongols and other Asiatic races
      of kindred manners. The ambassadors of the Emperor Justin relate that in
      the middle of the pavilion of Dizabulus, the Khan of the Turks, there
      were set out drinking-vessels, and flagons and great jars, all of gold;
      corresponding to the <em>coupes</em> (or <em>hanas à mances</em>), the <em>verniques</em>, and
      the <em>grant peitere</em> and <em>petietes peiteres</em> of Polo’s account. Rubruquis
      describes in Batu Khan’s tent a buffet near the entrance, where <em>Kumiz</em> was
      set forth, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>with great goblets of gold and silver, etc., and the like at the
      tent of the Great Kaan. At a festival at the court of Oljaitu, we are told,
      “Before the throne stood golden buffets ... set out with full flagons and
      goblets.” Even in the private huts of the Mongols there was a buffet of a
      humbler kind exhibiting a skin of <em>Kumiz</em>, with other kinds of drink, and
      cups standing ready; and in a later age at the banquets of Sháh Abbás we
      find the great buffet in a slightly different form, and the golden flagon
      still set to every two persons, though it no longer contained the liquor,
      which was handed round. (<cite>Cathay</cite>, clxiv., cci.; <cite>Rubr.</cite> 224, 268, 305;
      <cite>Ilch.</cite> II. 183; <cite>Della Valle</cite>, I. 654 and 750–751.)</p>

    <p>[Referring to the “large and very beautiful piece of workmanship,” Mr.
      Rockhill, <cite>Rubruck</cite>, 208–209, writes: “Similar works of art and mechanical
      contrivances were often seen in Eastern courts. The earliest I know of is
      the golden plane-tree and grape vine with bunches of grapes in precious
      stones, which was given to Darius by Pythius the Lydian, and which shaded
      the king’s couch. (Herodotus, IV. 24.) The most celebrated, however, and
      that which may have inspired Mangu with the desire to have something like
      it at his court, was the famous Throne of Solomon (<span lang="el">Σολομώντεος Θρóνος</span>)
      of the Emperor of Constantinople, Theophilus (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 829–842)....
      Abulfeda states that in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 917 the envoys of Constantine Porphyrogenitus
      to the Caliph el Moktader saw in the palace of Bagdad a tree with eighteen
      branches, some of gold, some of silver, and on them were gold and silver
      birds, and the leaves of the tree were of gold and silver. By means of
      machinery, the leaves were made to rustle and the birds to sing. Mirkhond
      speaks also of a tree of gold and precious stones in the city of Sultanieh,
      in the interior of which were conduits through which flowed drinks of
      different kinds. Clavijo describes a somewhat similar tree at the court of Timur.”</p>

    <p>Dr. Bretschneider (<cite>Peking</cite>, 28, 29) mentions a clepsydra with a lantern.
      By means of machinery put in motion by water, at fixed times a little man
      comes forward exhibiting a tablet, which announces the hours. He speaks
      also of a musical instrument which is connected, by means of a tube, with
      two peacocks sitting on a cross-bar, and when it plays, the mechanism
      causes the peacocks to dance.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Odoric describes the great jar of liquor in the middle of the palace hall,
      but in his time it was made of a great mass of jade (p. 130).</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIII24" href="#NoteAnchor_XIII24" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—This etiquette is specially noticed also by Odoric, as well as
      by Makrizi, by Rubruquis, and by Plano Carpini. According to the latter
      the breach of it was liable to be punished with death. The prohibition
      to tread on the threshold is also specially mentioned in a Mahomedan
      account of an embassy to the court of Barka Khan. And in regard to the
      tents, Rubruquis says he was warned not to touch the ropes, for these
      were regarded as representing the threshold. A Russo-Mongol author of
      our day says that the memory of this etiquette or superstition is still
      preserved by a Mongol proverb: “Step not on the threshold; it is a sin!”
      But among some of the Mongols more than this survives, as is evident from
      a passage in Mr. Michie’s narrative: “There is a right and a wrong way of
      approaching a <em>yourt</em> also. Outside the door there are generally ropes lying
      on the ground, held down by stakes, for the purpose of tying up the animals
      when they want to keep them together. There is a way of getting over or
      round these ropes that I never learned, but on one occasion the ignorant
      breach of the rule on our part excluded us from the hospitality of the
      family.” The feeling or superstition was in full force in Persia in the
      17th century, at least in regard to the threshold of the king’s palace. It
      was held a sin to tread upon it in entering. (<cite>Cathay</cite>, 132; <cite>Rubr.</cite> 255,
      268, 319; <cite>Plan. Carp.</cite> 625, 741; <cite>Makrizi</cite>, I. 214; <cite>Mél. Asiat. Ac. St.
      Petersb.</cite> II. 660; <cite>The Siberian Overland Route</cite>, p. 97; <cite>P. Della Valle</cite>, II. 171.)</p>

    <p>[Mr. Rockhill writes (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 104): “The same custom existed among
      the Fijians, I believe. I may note that it also prevailed in ancient
      China. It is said of Confucius ‘when he was standing he did not occupy the
      middle of the gate-way; when he passed in or out, he did not tread on the
      threshold.’ (<cite>Lun-yü</cite>, Bk. X. ch. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>iv. 2.) In China, the bride’s feet must
      not touch the threshold of the bridegroom’s house. (Cf. <cite>Dennys’ Folk-lore
      in China</cite>, p. 18.)</p>

    <p>“The author of the <cite>Ch’ue keng lu</cite> mentions also the athletes with clubs
      standing at the door, at the time of the khan’s presence in the hall. He
      adds, that next to the Khan, two other life-guards used to stand, who held
      in their hands ‘natural’ axes of jade (axes found fortuitously in the
      ground, probably primitive weapons).” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 43.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIII25" href="#NoteAnchor_XIII25" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—Some of these etiquettes were probably rather Chinese than Mongol,
      for the regulations of the court of Kúblái apparently combined the two. In
      the visit of Shah Rukh’s ambassadors to the court of the Emperor Ch’êng Tsu
      of the Ming Dynasty in 1421, we are told that by the side of the throne,
      at an imperial banquet, “there stood two eunuchs, each having a band of
      thick paper over his mouth, and extending to the tips of his ears.... Every
      time that a dish, or a cup of <em>darassun</em> (rice-wine) was brought to the
      emperor, all the music sounded.” (<cite>N. et Ext.</cite> XIV. 408, 409.) In one of
      the Persepolitan sculptures, there stands behind the King an eunuch bearing
      a fan, and with his mouth covered; at least so says Heeren. (<cite>Asia</cite>, I. 178.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Great Feast held by the Grand Kaan every Year on his
    Birthday.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> must know that the Tartars keep high festival yearly on their
    birthdays. And the Great Kaan was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>born on the 28th day of the September
    moon, so on that day is held the greatest feast of the year at the Kaan’s
    Court, always excepting that which he holds on New Year’s Day, of which I
    shall tell you afterwards.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIV21" href="#Note_XIV21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>Now, on his birthday, the Great Kaan dresses in the best of his robes, all
    wrought with beaten gold;<a id="NoteAnchor_XIV22" href="#Note_XIV22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> and full 12,000 Barons and Knights on
    that day come forth dressed in robes of the same colour, and precisely like
    those of the Great Kaan, except that they are not so costly; but still they
    are all of the same colour as his, and are also of silk and gold. Every
    man so clothed has also a girdle of gold; and this as well as the dress is
    given him by the Sovereign. And I will aver that there are some of these
    suits decked with so many pearls and precious stones that a single suit
    shall be worth full 10,000 golden bezants.</p>

  <p>And of such raiment there are several sets. For you must know that the
    Great Kaan, thirteen times in the year, presents to his Barons and Knights
    such suits of raiment as I am speaking of.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIV23" href="#Note_XIV23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> And on each occasion
    they wear the same colour that he does, a different colour being assigned
    to each festival. Hence you may see what a huge business it is, and that
    there is no prince in the world but he alone who could keep up such customs
    as these.</p>

  <p>On his birthday also, all the Tartars in the world, and all the countries
    and governments that owe allegiance to the Kaan, offer him great presents
    according to their several ability, and as prescription or orders have
    fixed the amount. And many other persons also come with great presents to
    the Kaan, in order to beg for some employment from him. And the Great Kaan
    has chosen twelve Barons on whom is laid the charge of assigning to each of
    these supplicants a suitable answer.</p>

  <p>On this day likewise all the Idolaters, all the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>Saracens, and all the
    Christians and other descriptions of people make great and solemn
    devotions, with much chaunting and lighting of lamps and burning of
    incense, each to the God whom he doth worship, praying that He would save
    the Emperor, and grant him long life and health and happiness.</p>

  <p>And thus, as I have related, is celebrated the joyous feast of the Kaan’s
    birthday.<a id="NoteAnchor_XIV24" href="#Note_XIV24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>Now I will tell you of another festival which the Kaan holds at the New
    Year, and which is called the White Feast.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIV21" href="#NoteAnchor_XIV21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The Chinese Year commences, according to Duhalde, with the New Moon
      nearest to the Sun’s Passage of the middle point of Aquarius; according
      to Pauthier, with the New Moon immediately preceding the Sun’s entry into
      Pisces. (These would almost always be identical, but not always.) Generally
      speaking, the first month will include part of February and part of March.
      The eighth month will then be September–October (<cite>v. ante</cite>, ch. ii. note 2).</p>

    <p>[According to Dr. S. W. Williams (<cite>Middle Kingdom</cite>, II. p. 70): “The year
      is lunar, but its commencement is regulated by the sun. New Year falls on
      the first new moon after the sun enters Aquarius, which makes it come not
      before January 21st nor after February 19th.” “The beginning of the civil
      year, writes Peter Hoang (<cite>Chinese Calendar</cite>, p. 13), depends upon the good
      pleasure of the Emperors. Under the Emperor Hwang-ti (2697 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) and under
      the Hsia Dynasty (2205 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>), it was made to commence with the 3rd month
      <em>yin-yüeh</em> [Pisces]; under the Shang Dynasty (1766 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) with the 2nd month
      <em>ch’ou-yüeh</em> [Aquarius], and under the Chou Dynasty (1122 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>) with the
      1st month <em>tzu-yüeh</em> [Capricorn].”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      rather, however, according to Dr. Rock, that the gold used in weaving such
      tissues was <em>not</em> wire but beaten sheets of gold cut into narrow strips.
      This would seem sufficient to explain the term “beaten gold,” though Dr.
      Rock in another passage refers it to a custom which he alleges of sewing
      goldsmith’s work upon robes. (<cite>Fr. Michel</cite>, <cite>Recherches</cite>, II. 389, also I.

    <p><a id="Note_XIV23" href="#NoteAnchor_XIV23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The number of these festivals and distributions of dresses is
      <em>thirteen</em> in all the old texts, except the Latin of the Geog. Soc., which
      has <em>twelve</em>. Thirteen would seem therefore to have been in the original
      copy. And the Ramusian version expands this by saying, “Thirteen great
      feasts that the Tartars keep with much <span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>solemnity to each of the thirteen
      moons of the year.”<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is possible, however, that this latter sentence
      is an interpolated gloss; for, besides the improbability of munificence
      so frequent, Pauthier has shown some good reasons why <em>thirteen</em> should
      be regarded as an error for <em>three</em>. The official History of the Mongol
      Dynasty, which he quotes, gives a detail of raiment distributed in presents
      on great state occasions <em>three</em> times a year. Such a mistake might easily
      have originated in the first dictation, <em>treize</em> substituted for <em>trois</em>,
      or rather for the old form <em>tres</em>; but we must note that the number 13 is
      repeated and corroborated in ch. xvi. Odoric speaks of <em>four</em> great yearly
      festivals, but there are obvious errors in what he says on this subject.
      Hammer says the great Mongol Feasts were three, viz. New Year’s Day, the
      Kaan’s Birthday, and the Feast of the Herds.</p>

    <p>Something like the changes of costume here spoken of is mentioned by
      Rubruquis at a great festival of four days’ duration at the court of Mangku
      Kaan: “Each day of the four they appeared in different raiment, suits of
      which were given them for each day of a different colour, but everything on
      the same day of one colour, from the boots to the turban.” So also Carpini
      says regarding the assemblies of the Mongol nobles at the inauguration of
      Kuyuk Kaan: “The first day they were all clad in white pourpre (? <i lang="la">albis
      purpuris</i>, see <a href="#Note_VI14">Bk. I. ch. vi. note 4</a>), the second day in ruby pourpre,
      the third day in blue pourpre, the fourth day in the finest baudekins.”
      (<cite>Cathay</cite>, 141; <cite>Rubr.</cite> 368; <cite>Pl. Car.</cite> 755.)</p>

    <p>[Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 247, note) makes the following remarks:
      “Odoric, however, says that the colours differed according to the rank.
      The custom of presenting <em>khilats</em> is still observed in Central Asia and
      Persia. I cannot learn from any other authority that the Mongols ever wore
      turbans. Odoric says the Mongols of the imperial feasts wore ‘coronets’
      (<i lang="la">in capite coronati</i>).”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XIV24" href="#NoteAnchor_XIV24" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—[“The accounts given by Marco Polo regarding the feasts of the
      Khan and the festival dresses at his Court, agree perfectly with the
      statements on the same subject of contemporary Chinese writers. Banquets
      were called in the common Mongol language <em>chama</em>, and festival dresses
      <em>chisun</em>. General festivals used to be held at the New Year and at the
      Birthday of the Khan. In the <cite>Mongol-Chinese Code</cite>, the ceremonies
      performed in the provinces on the Khan’s Birthday are described. One month
      before that day the civil and military officers repaired to a temple,
      where a service was performed to the Khan’s health. On the morning of the
      Birthday a sumptuously adorned table was placed in the open air, and the
      representatives of all classes and all confessions were obliged to approach
      the table, to prostrate themselves and exclaim three times: <em>Wan-sui</em>
      (<i>i.e.</i> ‘Ten thousand years’ life to the Khan). After that the banquet took
      place. In the same code (in the article on the <em>Ye li ke un</em> [Christians,
      <em>Erke-un</em>]) it is stated, that in the year 1304,—owing to a dispute,
      which had arisen in the province of Kiang-nan between the <em>ho-shang</em>
      (Buddhist priests) and the Christian missionaries, as to precedence in the
      above-mentioned ceremony,—a special edict was published, in which it was
      decided that in the rite of supplication, Christians should follow the
      Buddhist and Taouist priests.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, pp. 44–45.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">Of the Great Festival which the Kaan holds on New Year’s Day.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> beginning of their New Year is the month of February, and on that
    occasion the Great Kaan and all his subjects made such a Feast as I now
    shall describe.</p>

  <p>It is the custom that on this occasion the Kaan and all his subjects should
    be clothed entirely in white; so, that day, everybody is in white, men and
    women, great and small. And this is done in order that they may thrive
    all through the year, for they deem that white clothing is lucky.<a id="NoteAnchor_XV21" href="#Note_XV21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a>
    On that day also all the people of all the provinces and governments and
    kingdoms and countries that own allegiance to the Kaan bring him great
    presents of gold and silver, and pearls and gems, and rich textures of
    divers kinds. And this they do that the Emperor throughout the year may
    have abundance of treasure and enjoyment without care. And the people also
    make presents to each other of white things, and embrace and kiss and make
    merry, and wish each other happiness and good luck for the coming year. On
    that day, I can assure you, among the customary presents there shall be
    offered to the Kaan from various quarters more than 100,000 white horses,
    beautiful animals, and richly caparisoned. [And you must know ’tis their
    custom in offering presents to the Great Kaan (at least when the province
    making the present is able to do so), to present nine times nine articles.
    For instance, if a province sends horses, it sends nine times nine or 81
    horses; of gold, nine times <span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>nine pieces of gold, and so with stuffs or
    whatever else the present may consist of.]<a id="NoteAnchor_XV22" href="#Note_XV22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>On that day also, the whole of the Kaan’s elephants, amounting fully to
    5000 in number, are exhibited, all covered with rich and gay housings of
    inlaid cloth representing beasts and birds, whilst each of them carries on
    his back two splendid coffers; all of these being filled with the Emperor’s
    plate and other costly furniture required for the Court on the occasion of
    the White Feast.<a id="NoteAnchor_XV23" href="#Note_XV23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> And these are followed by a vast number of camels
    which are likewise covered with rich housings and laden with things needful
    for the Feast. All these are paraded before the Emperor, and it makes the
    finest sight in the world.</p>

  <p>Moreover, on the morning of the Feast, before the tables are set, all
    the Kings, and all the Dukes, Marquesses, Counts, Barons, Knights, and
    Astrologers, and Philosophers, and Leeches, and Falconers, and other
    officials of sundry kinds from all the places round about, present
    themselves in the Great Hall before the Emperor; whilst those who can
    find no room to enter stand outside in such a position that the Emperor
    can see them all well. And the whole company is marshalled in this wise.
    First are the Kaan’s sons, and his nephews, and the other Princes of the
    Blood Imperial; next to them all Kings; then Dukes, and then all others in
    succession according to the degree of each. And when they are all seated,
    each in his proper place, then a great prelate rises and says with a loud
    voice: “Bow and adore!” And as soon as he has said this, the company bow
    down until their foreheads touch the earth in adoration towards the Emperor
    as if he were a god. And this adoration they repeat four times, and then go
    to a highly decorated altar, on which is a vermilion tablet with the name
    of the Grand Kaan inscribed thereon, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>and a beautiful censer of gold. So
    they incense the tablet and the altar with great reverence, and then return
    each man to his seat.<a id="NoteAnchor_XV24" href="#Note_XV24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>When all have performed this, then the presents are offered, of which I
    have spoken as being so rich and costly. And after all have been offered
    and been seen by the Emperor, the tables are set, and all take their places
    at them with perfect order as I have already told you. And after dinner the
    jugglers come in and amuse the Court as you have heard before; and when
    that is over, every man goes to his quarters.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XV21" href="#NoteAnchor_XV21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The first month of the year is still called by the Mongols
      <em>Chaghan</em> or <em>Chaghan Sara</em>, “the White” or the “White Month”; and the
      wearing of white clothing on this festive occasion must have been purely
      a Mongol custom. For when Shah Rukh’s ambassadors were present at the
      New Year’s Feast at the Court of the succeeding <em>Chinese</em> Dynasty (2nd
      February, 1421) they were warned that <em>no one</em> must wear white, as that
      among the Chinese was the colour of mourning. (<cite>Koeppen</cite>, I. 574, II. 309;
      <cite>Cathay</cite>, p. ccvii.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XV22" href="#NoteAnchor_XV22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—On the mystic importance attached to the number 9 on all such

      (II. 210 of Amsterd. ed. 1757). Vámbéry, speaking of the <em>Ḳálín</em> or
      marriage price among the Uzbegs, says: “The question is always how many
      times <em>nine</em> sheep, cows, camels, or horses, or how many times nine ducats
      (as is the custom in a town), the father is to receive for giving up his
      daughter.” (<cite>Sketches of Cent. Asia</cite>, p. 103.) Sheikh Ibrahim of Darband,
      making offerings to Timur, presented <em>nines</em> of everything else, but of
      slaves <em>eight</em> only. “Where is the ninth?” enquired the court official.
      “Who but I myself?” said the Sheikh, and so won the heart of Timur. (<cite>A.
      Arabsiadis ... Timuri Hist.</cite> p. 357.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XV23" href="#NoteAnchor_XV23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The elephant stud of the Son of Heaven had dwindled till in 1862
      Dr. Rennie found but one animal; now none remain. [Dr. S. W. Williams
      writes (<cite>Middle Kingdom</cite>, I. pp. 323–324): “Elephants are kept at Peking
      for show, and are used to draw the state chariot when the Emperor goes to
      worship at the Altars of Heaven and Earth, but the sixty animals seen in
      the days of Kienlung, by Bell, have since dwindled to one or two. Van Braam
      met six going into Peking, sent thither from Yun-Nan.” These were no doubt
      carrying tribute from Burmah.—H.&nbsp;C.] It is worth noticing that the housings
      of cut cloth or <i lang="fr">appliqué</i> work (“<i lang="fr">draps entaillez</i>”) are still in fashion
      in India for the caparison of elephants.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XV24" href="#NoteAnchor_XV24" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—In 1263 Kúblái adopted the Chinese fashion of worshipping the
      tablets of his own ancestors, and probably at the same time the adoration
      of his own tablet by his subjects was introduced. Van Braam ingenuously
      relates how he and the rest of the Dutch Legation of 1794 performed the
      adoration of the Emperor’s Tablet on first entering China, much in the way
      described in the text.</p>

    <p>There is a remarkable amplification in the last paragraph of the chapter
      as given by Ramusio: “When all are in their proper places, a certain great
      personage, or high prelate as it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>were, gets up and says with a loud voice:
      ‘Bow yourselves and adore!’ On this immediately all bend and bow the
      forehead to the ground. Then the prelate says again: ‘God save and keep
      our Lord the Emperor, with length of years and with mirth and happiness.’
      And all answer: ‘So may it be!’ And then again the prelate says: ‘May God
      increase and augment his Empire and its prosperity more and more, and
      keep all his subjects in peace and goodwill, and may all things go well
      throughout his Dominion!’ And all again respond: ‘So may it be!’ And this
      adoration is repeated four times.”</p>

    <p>One of Pauthier’s most interesting notes is a long extract from the
      official Directory of Ceremonial under the Mongol Dynasty, which admirably
      illustrates the chapters we have last read. I borrow a passage regarding
      this adoration: “The Musician’s Song having ceased, the Ministers shall
      recite with a loud voice the following Prayer: ‘Great Heaven, that
      extendest over all! Earth which art under the guidance of Heaven! We invoke
      You and beseech You to heap blessings upon the Emperor and the Empress!
      Grant that they may live ten thousand, a hundred thousand years!’</p>

    <p>“Then the first Chamberlain shall respond: ‘May it be as the prayer hath
      said!’ The Ministers shall then prostrate themselves, and when they rise
      return to their places, and take a cup or two of wine.”</p>

    <p>The K’o-tow (<em>Khéu-théu</em>) which appears repeatedly in this ceremonial and
      which in our text is indicated by the four prostrations, was, Pauthier
      alleges, not properly a Chinese form, but only introduced by the Mongols.
      Baber indeed speaks of it as the <em>Ḳornish</em>, a Moghul ceremony, in which
      originally “the person who performed it kneeled nine times and touched
      the earth with his brow each time.” He describes it as performed very
      elaborately (nine times <em>twice</em>) by his younger uncle in visiting the
      elder. But in its essentials the ceremony must have been of old date at
      the Chinese Court; for the Annals of the Thang Dynasty, in a passage cited
      by M. Pauthier himself,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> mention that ambassadors from the famous Hárún
      ar Rashíd in 798 had to perform the “ceremony of kneeling and striking
      the forehead against the ground.” And M. Pauthier can scarcely be right
      in saying that the practice was disused by the Ming Dynasty and only
      reintroduced by the Manchus; for in the story of Shah Rukh’s embassy the
      performance of the K’o-tow occurs repeatedly.</p>

    <p>[“It is interesting to note,” writes Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, p. 22), “that
      in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 981 the Chinese Envoy, Wang Yen-tê, sent to the Uigur Prince of
      Kao-chang, refused to make genuflexions (<em>pai</em>) to him, as being contrary
      to the established usages as regards envoys. The prince and his family,
      however, on receiving the envoy, all faced eastward (towards Peking) and
      made an obeisance (<em>pai</em>) on receiving the imperial presents (<em>shou-tzŭ</em>).”
      (<cite>Ma Twan-lin</cite>, Bk. 336, 13.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>(<cite>Gaubil</cite>, 142; <cite>Van Braam</cite>, I. 20–21; <cite>Baber</cite>, 106; <cite>N. et E.</cite> XIV. Pt. I.
      405, 407, 418.)</p>

    <p>The enumeration of <em>four</em> prostrations in the text is, I fancy, quite
      correct. There are several indications that this number was used instead
      of the three times three of later days. Thus Carpini, when introduced to
      the Great Kaan, “bent the left knee four times.” And in the Chinese bridal
      ceremony of “Worshipping the Tablets,” the genuflexion is made four times.
      At the court of Sháh Abbás an obeisance evidently identical was repeated
      four times. (<cite>Carp.</cite> 759; <cite>Doolittle</cite>, p. 60; <cite>P. Della Valle</cite>, I. 646.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Twelve Thousand Barons who receive robes of Cloth of Gold
    from the Emperor on the Great Festivals, thirteen changes a-piece.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> you must know that the Great Kaan hath set apart 12,000 of his men who
    are distinguished by the name of <em>Keshican</em>, as I have told you before;
    and on each of these 12,000 Barons he bestows thirteen changes of raiment,
    which are all different from one another: I mean that in one set the 12,000
    are all of one colour; the next 12,000 of another colour, and so on; so
    that they are of thirteen different colours. These robes are garnished
    with gems and pearls and other precious things in a very rich and costly
    manner.<a id="NoteAnchor_XVI21" href="#Note_XVI21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a>
    And along with each of these changes of raiment, <i>i.e.</i>
    13 times in the year, he bestows on each of those 12,000 Barons a fine
    golden girdle of great richness and value, and likewise a pair of boots
    of <em>Camut</em>, that is to say of <em>Borgal</em>, curiously wrought with silver
    thread; insomuch that when they are clothed in these dresses every man of
    them looks like a king!<a id="NoteAnchor_XVI22" href="#Note_XVI22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> And there is an established order as to
    which dress is to be worn at each of those thirteen feasts. The Emperor
    himself also has his thirteen suits corresponding to those of his Barons;
    in <em>colour</em>, I mean (though his are grander, richer, and costlier), so that
    he is always arrayed in the same colour as his Barons, who are, as it were,
    his comrades. And you may see that all this costs an amount which it is
    scarcely possible to calculate.</p>

  <p>Now I have told you of the thirteen changes of raiment received from the
    Prince by those 12,000 Barons, amounting in all to 156,000 suits of so
    great cost and value, to say nothing of the girdles and the boots which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>are
    also worth a great sum of money. All this the Great Lord hath ordered, that
    he may attach the more of grandeur and dignity to his festivals.</p>

  <p>And now I must mention another thing that I had forgotten, but which you
    will be astonished to learn from this Book. You must know that on the Feast
    Day a great Lion is led to the Emperor’s presence, and as soon as it sees
    him it lies down before him with every sign of the greatest veneration, as
    if it acknowledged him for its lord; and it remains there lying before him,
    and entirely unchained. Truly this must seem a strange story to those who
    have not seen the thing!<a id="NoteAnchor_XVI23" href="#Note_XVI23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XVI21" href="#NoteAnchor_XVI21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—On the
      <em>Keshican</em>, see <a href="#Note_XII21">note 1 to chap. xii.</a>, and on the changes
      of raiment <a href="#Note_XIV23">note 3 to chap. xiv.</a>, and the remarks there as to the number
      of distributions. I confess that the stress laid upon the number 13 in
      this chapter makes the supposition of error more difficult. But there is
      something odd and unintelligible about the whole of the chapter except
      the last paragraph. For the 12,000 <em>Keshican</em> are here all elevated to
      <em>Barons</em>; and at the same time the statement about their changes of raiment
      seems to be merely that already made in chapter xiv. This repetition occurs
      only in the French MSS., but as it is in all these we cannot reject it.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVI22" href="#NoteAnchor_XVI22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      2.</a>—The words <em>Camut</em> and <em>Borgal</em> appear both to be used here for what
      we call <em>Russia-Leather</em>. The latter word in one form or another, <em>Bolghár,
      Borgháli</em>, or <em>Bulkál</em>, is the term applied to that material to this day
      nearly all over Asia. Ibn Batuta says that in travelling during winter
      from Constantinople to the Wolga he had to put on three pairs of boots,
      one of wool (which we should call stockings), a second of wadded linen,
      and a third of <em>Borgháli</em>, “<i>i.e.</i> of horse-leather lined with wolf-skin.”
      Horse-leather seems to be still the favourite material for boots among all
      the Tartar nations. The name was undoubtedly taken from <em>Bolghar</em> on the
      Wolga, the people of which are traditionally said to have invented the art
      of preparing skins in that manner. This manufacture is still one of the
      staple trades of Kazan, the city which in position and importance is the
      nearest representative of Bolghar now.</p>

    <p><em>Camut</em> is explained by Klaproth to be “leather made from the back-skin of
      a camel.” It appears in Johnson’s Persian Dictionary as <em>Kámú</em>, but I do
      not know from what language it originally comes. The word is in the Latin
      column of the Petrarchian Vocabulary with the Persian rendering <em>Sagri</em>.
      This shows us what is meant, for <em>Saghrí</em> is just our word <em>Shagreen</em>,
      and is applied to a fine leather granulated in that way, which is much
      used for boots and the like by the people of Central Asia. [In Turkish
      <em>ṣāghri</em> or <em>saghri</em> is the name both for the buttocks of a horse and the
      leather called <em>shagreen</em> prepared with them. (See <cite>Devic, Dict. Étym.</cite>)—H.&nbsp;C.]
      In the commercial lists of our Indian north-west frontier we find as
      synonymous <em>Saghri</em> or <em>Kímukht</em>, “Horse or Ass-hide.” No doubt this latter
      word is a form of <em>Kámú</em> or <em>Camut</em>. It appears (as <em>Keimukht</em>, “a sort
      of leather”) in a detail of imports to Aden given by <cite>Ibn al Wardi</cite>, a
      geographer of the 13th century.</p>

    <p>Instead of Camut, Ramusio has <em>Camoscia</em>, <i>i.e.</i> Chamois, and the same
      seems to be in all the editions based on Fra Pipino’s version. It may be
      a misrendering of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span><em>camutum</em> or <em>camutium</em>; or is there any real connexion
      between the Oriental <em>Kámú Kímukht</em>, and the Italian <em>camoscia</em>? (<cite>I. B.</cite>
      II. 445; <cite>Klapr. Mém.</cite> vol. III.; <cite>Davies’s Trade Report</cite>, App. p. ccxx.;
      <cite>Vámbéry’s Travels</cite>, 423; <cite>Not. et Ext.</cite> II. 43.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVIII21" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIII21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—The Cheeta or Hunting-Leopard, still kept for the chase by native
      noblemen in India, is an animal very distinct from the true leopard. It
      is much more lanky and long-legged than the pure felines, is unable to
      climb trees, and has claws only partially retractile. Wood calls it a link
      between the feline and canine races. One thousand Cheetas were attached
      to Akbar’s hunting establishment; and the chief one, called Semend-Manik,
      was carried to the field in a palankin with a kettledrum beaten before
      him. Boldensel in the first half of the 14th century speaks of the Cheeta
      as habitually used in Cyprus; but, indeed, a hundred years before, these
      animals had been constantly employed by the Emperor Frederic II. in Italy,
      and accompanied him on all his marches. They were introduced into France
      in the latter part of the 15th century, and frequently employed by Lewis
      XI., Charles VIII., and Lewis XII. The leopards were kept in a ditch of the
      Castle of Amboise, and the name still borne by a gate hard by, <em>Porte des
      Lions</em>, is supposed to be due to that circumstance. The <em>Mœurs et Usages
      du Moyen Age</em> (Lacroix), from which I take the last facts, gives copy of
      a print by John Stradanus representing a huntsman with the leopard on his
      horse’s crupper, like Kúblái’s (<i>supra</i>, <a href="#CHAPTER_LXI1">Bk. I. ch. lxi.</a>); Frederic II. used
      to say of his Cheetas, “they knew how to ride.” This way of taking the
      Cheeta to the field had been first employed by the Khalif Yazid, son of
      Moáwiyah. The Cheeta often appears in the pattern of silk damasks of the
      13th and 14th centuries, both Asiatic and Italian. (<em>Ayeen Akbery</em>, I.
      304, etc.; <em>Boldensel</em>, in <cite>Canisii Thesaurus</cite>, by <cite>Basnage</cite>, vol. IV. p.

    <p>[The hunting equipment of the Sultan consisted of about thirty falconers
      on horseback who carried each a bird on his fist. These falconers were in
      front of seven horsemen, who had behind a kind of tamed tiger at times
      employed by His Highness for hare-hunting, notwithstanding what may be said
      to the contrary by those who are inclined not to believe the fact. It is a
      thing known by everybody here, and cannot be doubted except by those who
      admit that they believe nothing of foreign customs. These tigers were each
      covered with a brocade cloth—and their peaceful attitude, added to their
      ferocious and savage looks, caused at the same time astonishment and fear
      in the soul of those whom they looked upon. (<cite>Journal d’Antoine Galland</cite>,
      trad. par Ch. Schefer, I. p. 135.) The Cheeta (<i>Gueparda jubata</i>) was,

      serviers</em> of Pauthier’s MS. C, though he has adopted from another <em>Loups</em>
      simply, which is certainly wrong. The <cite>Geog. Latin</cite> has “<i>Linceos i.e.
      lupos cerverios</i>.” There is no doubt that the <em>Loup-cervier</em> is the
      Lynx. Thus Brunetto Latini, describing the Loup-cervier, speaks of its
      remarkable powers of vision, and refers to its agency in the production of
      the precious stone called <em>Liguire</em> (<i>i.e.</i> <em>Ligurium</em>), which the ancients
      fancied to come from <em>Lync-urium</em>; the tale is in Theophrastus. Yet the
      quaint Bestiary of Philip de Thaun, published by Mr. Wright, identifies it
      with the Greek Hyena:—</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>[The Abbé Armand David writes (<cite>Missions Cathol.</cite> XXI. 1889, p. 227) that
      there is in China, from the mountains of Manchuria to the mountains of
      Tibet, a lynx <span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>called by the Chinese <em>T’u-pao</em> (earth-coloured panther); a
      lynx somewhat similar to the <em>loup-cervier</em> is found on the western border
      of China, and has been named <cite>Lyncus Desgodinsi</cite>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Hunting Lynxes were used at the Court of Akbar. They are also mentioned by
      A. Hamilton as so used in Sind at the end of the 17th century. This author
      calls the animal a <em>Shoe-goose</em>! <i>i.e.</i> <em>Siya-gosh</em> (Black-ear), the Persian
      name of the Lynx. It is still occasionally used in the chase by natives
      of rank in India. (<cite>Brunetto Lat. Tresor</cite>, p. 248; <cite>Popular Treatises on

    <p><a id="Note_XVIII23" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIII23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 3.</a>—The conception of a Tiger seems almost to have dropped out of the
      European mind during the Middle Ages. Thus in a mediæval Bestiary, a
      chapter on the Tiger begins: “<i lang="fr">Une Beste est qui est apelée Tigre c’est une
      manière de</i> Serpent.” Hence Polo can only call the Tigers, whose portrait
      he draws here not incorrectly, <em>Lions</em>. So also nearly 200 years later
      Barbaro gives a like portrait, and calls the animal <em>Leonza</em>. Marsden
      supposes judiciously that the confusion may have been promoted by the
      ambiguity of the Persian <em>Sher</em>.</p>

    <p>The Chinese pilgrim, Sung-Yun (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 518), saw two young lions at the Court
      of Gandhára. He remarks that the pictures of these animals common in China,
      were not at all good likenesses. (<cite>Beal</cite>, p. 200.)</p>

    <p>We do not hear in modern times of Tigers trained to the chase, but Chardin
      says of Persia: “In hunting the larger animals they make use of beasts
      of prey trained for the purpose, <em>lions</em>, leopards, <em>tigers</em>, panthers,
      ounces.”</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XVIII24" href="#NoteAnchor_XVIII24" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—This is perfectly correct. In Eastern Turkestan, and among the
      Kirghiz to this day, eagles termed <em>Búrgút</em> (now well known to be the
      Golden Eagle) are tamed and trained to fly at wolves, foxes, deer, wild
      goats, etc. A Kirghiz will <span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>give a good horse for an eagle in which he
      recognises capacity for training. Mr. Atkinson gives vivid descriptions
      and illustrations of this eagle (which he calls “Bear coote”), attacking
      both deer and wolves. He represents the bird as striking one claw into the
      neck, and the other into the back of its large prey, and then tearing out
      the liver with its beak. In justice both to Marco Polo and to Mr. Atkinson,
      I have pleasure in adding a vivid account of the exploits of this bird,
      as witnessed by one of my kind correspondents, the Governor-General’s
      late envoy to Kashgar. And I trust Sir Douglas Forsyth will pardon my
      quoting his own letter just as it stands<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>:—“Now for a story of the
      <em>Burgoot</em>—Atkinson’s ‘Bearcoote.’ I think I told you it was the Golden
      Eagle and supposed to attack wolves and even bears. One day we came across
      a wild hog of enormous size, far bigger than any that gave sport to the
      Tent Club in Bengal. The Burgoot was immediately let loose, and went
      straight at the hog, which it kicked, and flapped with its wings, and
      utterly <em>flabbergasted</em>, whilst our Kashgaree companions attacked him with
      sticks and brought him to the ground. As Friar Odoric would say, I, T. D.
      F., have seen this with mine own eyes.”—Shaw describes the rough treatment
      with which the Búrgút is tamed. Baber, when in the Bajaur Hills, notices
      in his memoirs: “This day Búrgút took a deer.” (<cite>Timkowski</cite>, I. 414;

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Two Brothers who have charge of the Kaan’s Hounds.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Emperor hath two Barons who are own brothers, one called Baian and the
    other Mingan; and these two are styled <em>Chinuchi</em> (or <em>Cunichi</em>), which
    is as much as to say, “The Keepers of the Mastiff Dogs.”<a id="NoteAnchor_XIX21" href="#Note_XIX21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> Each of
    these brothers hath 10,000 men under his orders; each body of 10,000 being
    dressed alike, the one in red and the other in blue, and whenever they
    accompany the Lord to the chase, they wear this livery, in order to be
    recognized. Out of each body of 10,000 there are 2000 men who are each in
    charge of one or more great mastiffs, so that the whole number of these is
    very large. And when the Prince goes a-hunting, one of those Barons, with
    his 10,000 men and something like 5000 dogs, goes <span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>towards the right, whilst
    the other goes towards the left with his party in like manner. They move
    along, all abreast of one another, so that the whole line extends over a
    full day’s journey, and no animal can escape them. Truly it is a glorious
    sight to see the working of the dogs and the huntsmen on such an occasion!
    And as the Lord rides a-fowling across the plains, you will see these big
    hounds coming tearing up, one pack after a bear, another pack after a stag,
    or some other beast, as it may hap, and running the game down now on this
    side and now on that, so that it is really a most delightful sport and
    spectacle.</p>

  <p>[The Two Brothers I have mentioned are bound by the tenure of their office
    to supply the Kaan’s Court from October to the end of March with 1000 head
    of game daily, whether of beasts or birds, and not counting quails; and
    also with fish to the best of their ability, allowing fish enough for three
    persons to reckon as equal to one head of game.]</p>

  <p>Now I have told you of the Masters of the Hounds and all about them, and
    next will I tell you how the Lord goes off on an expedition for the space
    of three months.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XIX21" href="#NoteAnchor_XIX21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Though this particular Bayan and Mingan are not likely to be
      mentioned in history, the names are both good Mongol names; <em>Bayan</em> that
      of a great soldier under Kúblái, of whom we shall hear afterwards; and
      <em>Mingan</em> that of one of Chinghiz’s generals.</p>

    <p>The title of “Master of the Mastiffs” belonged to a high Court official
      at Constantinople in former days, <em>Sámsúnji Báshi</em>, and I have no doubt
      Marco has given the exact interpretation of the title of the two Barons:
      though it is difficult to trace its elements. It is read variously <em>Cunici</em>
      (<i>i.e.</i> <em>Kunichi</em>) and <em>Cinuci</em> (<i>i.e.</i> <em>Chinuchi</em>). It is evidently a word of
      analogous structure to <em>Kushchi</em>, the Master of the Falcons; <em>Parschi</em>, the
      Master of the Leopards. Professor Schiefner thinks it is probably corrupted
      from <em>Noghaichi</em>, which appears in Kovalevski’s Mongol Dict. as “<i lang="fr">chasseur
      qui a soins des chiens courants</i>.” This word occurs, he points out, in
      Sanang Setzen, where Schmidt translates it <i lang="de">Aufseher über Hunde</i>. (See <cite>S. S.</cite> p. 39.)</p>

    <p>The metathesis of <em>Noghai</em>-chi into <em>Kuni</em>-chi is the only drawback to this
      otherwise apt solution. We generally shall find Polo’s Oriental words much
      more accurately expressed than this would imply—as in the next chapter. I
      have hazarded a suggestion of (Or. Turkish) <em>Chong-It-chi</em>, “Keeper of the
      Big Dogs,” which Professor Vámbéry thinks possible. (See “<em>chong</em>, big,
      strong,” in his <cite>Tschagataische Sprachstudien</cite>, <span class="pagenum"
      id="Page_402">402</span>p. 282, and note in <cite>Lord
      Strangford’s Selected Writings</cite>, II. 169.) In East Turkestan they call the
      Chinese <em>Chong Káfir</em>, “The Big Heathen.” This would exactly correspond
      to the rendering of Pipino’s Latin translation, “<i lang="la">hoc est canum magnorum
      Praefecti</i>.” <em>Chinuchi</em> again would be (in Mongol) “Wolf-keepers.” It is at
      least possible that the great dogs which Polo terms mastiffs may have been
      known by such a name. We apply the term Wolf-dog to several varieties, and
      in Macbeth’s enumeration we have—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">——“Hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,</div>
          <div class="i0">Shoughs, water rugs, and <em>Demi-Wolves</em>.”</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Lastly the root-word may be the Chinese <em>Kiuen</em>, “dog,” as Pauthier says.
      The mastiffs were probably Tibetan, but may have come through China, and
      brought a name with them, like <em>Boule-dogues</em> in France.</p>

    <p>[Palladius (p. 46) says that <em>Chinuchi</em> or <em>Cunici</em> “have no resemblance
      with any of the names found in the <cite>Yuen shi</cite>, ch. xcix., article <em>Ping
      chi</em> (military organisation), and relating to the hunting staff of the
      Khan, viz.: <em>Si pao ch’i</em> (falconers), <em>Ho r ch’i</em> (archers), and <em>Ke lien
      ch’i</em> (probably those who managed the hounds).”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Emperor goes on a Hunting Expedition.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">After</span> he has stopped at his capital city those three months that I
    mentioned, to wit, December, January, February, he starts off on the 1st
    day of March, and travels southward towards the Ocean Sea, a journey of
    two days.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX21" href="#Note_XX21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> He takes with him full 10,000 falconers, and some 500
    gerfalcons besides peregrines, sakers, and other hawks in great numbers;
    and goshawks also to fly at the water-fowl.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX22" href="#Note_XX22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> But do not suppose
    that he keeps all these together by him; they are distributed about,
    hither and thither, one hundred together, or two hundred at the utmost,
    as he thinks proper. But they are always fowling as they advance, and the
    most part of the quarry taken is carried to the Emperor. And let me tell
    you when he goes thus a-fowling with his gerfalcons and other hawks, he
    is attended by full 10,000 men who are disposed in couples; and these are
    called <span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span><em>Toscaol</em>, which is as much as to say, “Watchers.” And the name
    describes their business.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX23" href="#Note_XX23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> They are posted from spot to spot, always
    in couples, and thus they cover a great deal of ground! Every man of them
    is provided with a whistle and hood, so as to be able to call in a hawk
    and hold it in hand. And when the Emperor makes a cast, there is no need
    that he follow it up, for those men I speak of keep so good a look out that
    they never lose sight of the birds, and if these have need of help they are
    ready to render it.</p>

  <p>All the Emperor’s hawks, and those of the Barons as well, have a little
    label attached to the leg to mark them, on which is written the names
    of the owner and the keeper of the bird. And in this way the hawk, when
    caught, is at once identified and handed over to its owner. But if not, the
    bird is carried to a certain Baron, who is styled the <em>Bularguchi</em>, which
    is as much as to say “The Keeper of Lost Property.” And I tell you that
    whatever may be found without a known owner, whether it be a horse, or a
    sword, or a hawk, or what not, it is carried to that Baron straightway, and
    he takes charge of it. And if the finder neglects to carry his trover to
    the Baron, the latter punishes him. Likewise the loser of any article goes
    to the Baron, and if the thing be in his hands it is immediately given up
    to the owner. Moreover, the said Baron always pitches on the highest spot
    of the camp, with his banner displayed, in order that those who have lost
    or found anything may have no difficulty in finding their way to him. Thus
    nothing can be lost but it shall be incontinently found and restored.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX24" href="#Note_XX24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>And so the Emperor follows this road that I have mentioned, leading along
    in the vicinity of the Ocean Sea (which is within two days’ journey of his
    capital city, Cambaluc), and as he goes there is many a fine sight to be
    seen, and plenty of the very best entertainment in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>hawking; in fact, there
    is no sport in the world to equal it!</p>

  <p>The Emperor himself is carried upon four elephants in a fine chamber made
    of timber, lined inside with plates of beaten gold, and outside with lions’
    skins [for he always travels in this way on his fowling expeditions,
    because he is troubled with gout]. He always keeps beside him a dozen of
    his choicest gerfalcons, and is attended by several of his Barons, who
    ride on horseback alongside. And sometimes, as they may be going along,
    and the Emperor from his chamber is holding discourse with the Barons, one
    of the latter shall exclaim: “Sire! Look out for Cranes!” Then the Emperor
    instantly has the top of his chamber thrown open, and having marked the
    cranes he casts one of his gerfalcons, whichever he pleases; and often the
    quarry is struck within his view, so that he has the most exquisite sport
    and diversion, there as he sits in his chamber or lies on his bed; and all
    the Barons with him get the enjoyment of it likewise! So it is not without
    reason I tell you that I do not believe there ever existed in the world or
    ever will exist, a man with such sport and enjoyment as he has, or with
    such rare opportunities.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX25" href="#Note_XX25" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>And when he has travelled till he reaches a place called <span class="smcap">Cachar Modun</span>,<a id="NoteAnchor_XX26" href="#Note_XX26" class="fnanchor">{6}</a>
    there he finds his tents pitched, with the tents of his Sons, and his
    Barons, and those of his Ladies and theirs, so that there shall be full
    10,000 tents in all, and all fine and rich ones. And I will tell you how
    his own quarters are disposed. The tent in which he holds his courts is
    large enough to give cover easily to a thousand souls. It is pitched with
    its door to the south, and the Barons and Knights remain in waiting in
    it, whilst the Lord abides in another close to it on the west side. When
    he wishes to speak with any one he causes the person to be summoned to
    that other tent. Immediately behind the great tent there is a fine <span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>large
    chamber where the Lord sleeps; and there are also many other tents and
    chambers, but they are not in contact with the Great Tent as these are. The
    two audience-tents and the sleeping-chamber are constructed in this way.
    Each of the audience-tents has three poles, which are of spice-wood, and
    are most artfully covered with lions’ skins, striped with black and white
    and red, so that they do not suffer from any weather. All three apartments
    are also covered outside with similar skins of striped lions, a substance
    that lasts for ever.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX27" href="#Note_XX27" class="fnanchor">{7}</a> And inside they are all lined with ermine
    and sable, these two being the finest and most costly furs in existence.
    For a robe of sable, large enough to line a mantle, is worth 2000 bezants
    of gold, or 1000 at least, and this kind of skin is called by the Tartars
    “The King of Furs.” The beast itself is about the size of a marten.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX28" href="#Note_XX28" class="fnanchor">{8}</a>
    These two furs of which I speak are applied and inlaid so exquisitely,
    that it is really something worth seeing. All the tent-ropes are of silk.
    And in short I may say that those tents, to wit the two audience-halls and
    the sleeping-chamber, are so costly that it is not every king could pay for them.</p>

  <p>Round about these tents are others, also fine ones and beautifully pitched,
    in which are the Emperor’s ladies, and the ladies of the other princes and
    officers. And then there are the tents for the hawks and their keepers,
    so that altogether the number of tents there on the plain is something
    wonderful. To see the many people that are thronging to and fro on every
    side and every day there, you would take the camp for a good big city. For
    you must reckon the Leeches, and the Astrologers, and the Falconers, and
    all the other attendants on so great a company; and add that everybody
    there has his whole family with him, for such is their custom.</p>

  <p>The Lord remains encamped there until the spring, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>and all that time he
    does nothing but go hawking round about among the canebrakes along the
    lakes and rivers that abound in that region, and across fine plains on
    which are plenty of cranes and swans, and all sorts of other fowl. The
    other gentry of the camp also are never done with hunting and hawking, and
    every day they bring home great store of venison and feathered game of all
    sorts. Indeed, without having witnessed it, you would never believe what
    quantities of game are taken, and what marvellous sport and diversion they
    all have whilst they are in camp there.</p>

  <p>There is another thing I should mention; to wit, that for 20 days’ journey
    round the spot nobody is allowed, be he who he may, to keep hawks or
    hounds, though anywhere else whosoever list may keep them. And furthermore
    throughout all the Emperor’s territories, nobody however audacious dares
    to hunt any of these four animals, to wit, hare, stag, buck, and roe, from
    the month of March to the month of October. Anybody who should do so would
    rue it bitterly. But those people are so obedient to their Lord’s command,
    that even if a man were to find one of those animals asleep by the roadside
    he would not touch it for the world! And thus the game multiplies at such
    a rate that the whole country swarms with it, and the Emperor gets as much
    as he could desire. Beyond the term I have mentioned, however, to wit that
    from March to October, everybody may take these animals as he list.<a id="NoteAnchor_XX29" href="#Note_XX29" class="fnanchor">{9}</a></p>

  <p>After the Emperor has tarried in that place, enjoying his sport as I have
    related, from March to the middle of May, he moves with all his people, and
    returns straight to his capital city of Cambaluc (which is also the capital
    of Cathay, as you have been told), but all the while continuing to take his
    diversion in hunting and hawking as he goes along.</p>

      1.</a>—“<i lang="fr">Vait vers midi jusques à la Mer Occeane, ou il y a deux
      journées.</i>” It is not possible in any way to reconcile this description
      as it stands with truth, though I do not see much room for doubt as to
      the direction of the excursion. Peking is 100 miles as the crow flies
      from the nearest point of the coast, at least six or seven days’ march
      for such a camp, and the direction is south-east, or nearly so. The last
      circumstance would not be very material as Polo’s compass-bearings are not
      very accurate. We shall find that he makes the general line of bearing from
      Peking towards Kiangnan, <em>Sciloc</em> or S. East, hence his <em>Midi</em> ought in
      consistency to represent <em>S. West</em>, an impossible direction for the Ocean.
      It is remarkable that Ramusio has <em>Greco</em> or <em>N. East</em>, which would by the
      same relative correction represent <em>East</em>. And other circumstances point to
      the frontier of Liao-tong as the direction of this excursion. Leaving the
      <em>two days</em> out of question, therefore, I should suppose the “Ocean Sea” to
      be struck at Shan-hai-kwan near the terminus of the Great Wall, and that
      the site of the standing hunting-camp is in the country to the north of
      that point. The Jesuit Verbiest accompanied the Emperor Kanghi on a tour in
      this direction in 1682, and almost immediately after passing the Wall the
      Emperor and his party seem to have struck off to the left for sport. Kúblái
      started on the “1st of March,” probably however the 1st of the second
      Chinese month. Kanghi started from Peking on the 23rd of March, on the
      hunting-journey just referred to.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX22" href="#NoteAnchor_XX22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—We are told that Bajazet had 7000 falconers and 6000 dog-keepers;
      whilst Sultan Mahomed Tughlak of India in the generation following Polo’s,
      is said to have had 10,000 falconers, and 3000 other attendants as beaters.
      (<cite>Not. et Ext.</cite> XIII. p. 185.)</p>

    <p>The Oriental practice seems to have assigned one man to the attendance
      on every hawk. This Kaempfer says was the case at the Court of Persia at
      the beginning of last century. There were about 800 hawks, and each had a
      special keeper. The same was the case with the Emperor Kanghi’s hawking
      establishment, according to Gerbillon. (<cite>Am. Exot.</cite> p. 83; <cite>Gerb.</cite> 1st
      Journey, in <cite>Duhalde</cite>.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX23" href="#NoteAnchor_XX23" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      3.</a>—The French MSS. read <em>Toscaor</em>; the reading in the text I take from
      Ramusio. It is Turki, <em>Tosḳáúl</em>, <span lang="ar">توسقاول</span>, defined as “Gardien, surveillant
      de la route; Wächter, Wache, Wegehüter.” (See <cite>Zenker</cite>, and <cite>Pavet de
      Courteille</cite>.) The word is perhaps also Mongol, for Rémusat has <em>Tosiyal</em> =
      “Veille.” (<cite>Mél. As.</cite> I. 231.) Such an example of Polo’s correctness both
      in the form and meaning of a Turki word is worthy of especial note, and
      shows how little he merits the wild and random treatment which has been
      often applied to the solution of like phrases in his book.</p>

    <p>[Palladius (p. 47) says that he has heard from men well acquainted with
      the customs of the Mongols, that at the present day in “battues,” the
      leaders of the two flanks which surround the game, are called <em>toscaul</em> in
      Mongol.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX24" href="#NoteAnchor_XX24" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—The remark in the previous note might be repeated here. The
      <em>Bularguji</em> was an officer of the Mongol camp, whose duties are thus
      described by Mahomed Hindú Shah in a work on the offices of the Perso-Mongol
      Court. “He is an officer appointed by the Council of State, who, at
      the time when the camp is struck, goes over the ground with his servants,
      and collects slaves of either sex, or cattle, such as horses, camels, oxen,
      and asses, that have been left behind, and retains them until the owners
      appear and prove their claim to the property, when he makes it over to
      them. The <em>Bularguji</em> sticks up a flag by his tent or hut to enable people
      to find him, and so recover their lost property.” (<cite>Golden Horde</cite>, p. 245.)
      And in the Appendix to that work (p. 476) there is a copy of a warrant to
      such a Bularguji or Provost Marshal. The derivation appears therein as from
      <em>Bularghu</em>, “Lost property.” Here again it was impossible to give both form
      and meaning of the word more exactly than Polo has done. Though Hammer
      writes these terminations in <em>ji</em> (<em>dschi</em>), I believe <em>chi</em> (<em>tschi</em>) is
      preferable. We have this same word <em>Bularghu</em> in a grant of privileges to
      the Venetians by the Ilkhan Abusaid, 22nd December, 1320, which has been
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>published by M. Mas Latrie: “<em>Item, se algun cavalo</em> bolargo <em>fosse trovado
      apreso de algun vostro veneciano</em>,” etc.—“If any stray horse shall be found
      in the possession of a Venetian,” etc. (See <cite>Bibl. de l’École des Chartes</cite>,
      1870—<cite>tirage à part</cite>, p. 26.)</p>

    <p>[“There are two Mongol terms, which resemble this word <em>Bularguchi</em>, viz.
      <em>Balagachi</em> and <em>Buluguchi</em>. But the first was the name used for the
      door-keeper of the tent of the Khan. By Buluguchi the Mongols understood
      a hunter and especially sable hunters. No one of these terms can be made
      consistent with the accounts given by M. Polo regarding the Bularguchi.
      In the <em>Kui sin tsa shi</em>, written by Chow Mi, in the former part of
      the 14th century, interesting particulars regarding Mongol hunting are
      found.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, 47.) In chapter 101, <cite>Djan-ch’i</cite>, of the <cite>Yuen-shi</cite>,
      Falconers are called <em>Ying fang pu lie</em>, and a certain class of the
      Falconers are termed <em>Bo-lan-ghi</em>. (<cite>Bretschneider, Med. Res.</cite> I. p.
      188.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX25" href="#NoteAnchor_XX25" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—A like description is given by Odoric of the mode in which a
      successor of Kúblái travelled between Cambaluc and Shangtu, with his
      falcons also in the chamber beside him. What Kúblái had adopted as an
      indulgence to his years and gout, his successors probably followed as a
      precedent without these excuses.</p>

    <p>[With regard to the gout of Kúblái Khan, Palladius (p. 48) writes: “In the
      Corean history allusion is made twice to the Khan’s suffering from this
      disease. Under the year 1267, it is there recorded that in the 9th month,
      envoys of the Khan with a letter to the King arrived in Corea. Kubilai
      asked for the skin of the <em>Akirho munho</em>, a fish resembling a cow. The
      envoy was informed that, as the Khan suffered from swollen feet it would
      be useful for him to wear boots made of the skin of this animal, and in
      the 10th month, the king of Corea forwarded to the Khan seventeen skins of
      it. It is further recorded in the Corean history, that in the 8th month
      of 1292, sorcerers and <em>Shaman</em> women from Corea were sent at the request
      of the Khan to cure him of a disease of the feet and hands. At that time
      the king of Corea was also in Peking, and the sorcerers and Shaman women
      were admitted during an audience the King had of the Khan. They took the
      Khan’s hands and feet and began to recite exorcisms, whilst Kubilai was
      laughing.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX26" href="#NoteAnchor_XX26" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      6.</a>—Marsden and Pauthier identify Cachar Modun with <em>Tchakiri Mondou</em>,
      or <em>Moudon</em>, which appears in D’Anville’s atlas as the title of a <span lang="fr">“Levée
      de terre naturelle,”</span> in the extreme east of Manchuria, and in lat. 44°,
      between the Khinga Lake and the sea. This position is out of the question.
      It is more than 900 miles, <em>in a straight line</em> from Peking, and the mere
      journey thither and back would have taken Kúblái’s camp something like six
      months. The name <em>Kachar Modun</em> is probably Mongol, and as <em>Katzar</em> is =
      “land, region,” and <em>Modun</em> = “wood” or “tree,” a fair interpretation lies
      on the surface. Such a name indeed has little individuality. But the Jesuit
      maps have a <em>Modun Khotan</em> (“Wood-ville”) just about the locality supposed,
      viz. in the region north of the eastern extremity of the Great Wall.</p>

    <p>[Captain Gill writes (<cite>River of Golden Sand</cite>, I. p. 111): “This country
      around Urh-Chuang is admirably described [in <cite>Marco Polo</cite>, pp. 403, 406],
      and I should almost imagine that the Kaan must have set off south-east
      from Peking, and enjoyed some of his hawking not far from here, before he
      travelled to Cachar Modun, wherever that may have been.”</p>

    <p>“With respect to Cachar Modun, Marco Polo intends perhaps by this name
      Ho-si wu, which place, together with Yang-ts’un, were comprised in the
      general name <em>Ma t’ou</em> (perhaps the <em>Modun</em> of M. Polo). Ma-t’ou is even
      now a general term for a jetty in Chinese. Ho-si in the Mongol spelling
      was Ha-shin. D’Ohsson, in his translation of Rashid-eddin renders <em>Ho-si</em>
      by <em>Co-shi</em> (<cite>Hist. des Mongols</cite>, I. p. 95), but Rashid in that case
      speaks not of Ho-si wu, but of the Tangut Empire, which in Chinese was
      called Ho-si, meaning west of the (Yellow) River. (See <i>supra</i>, <a href="#Page_205">p. 205</a>).
      Ho-si wu, as well as Yang-ts’un, both exist even now as villages on the
      Pei-ho River, and near the first ancient walls can be seen. Ho-si wu means:
      ‘Custom’s barrier west of the (Pei-ho) river.’” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, p. 45.) This
      identification cannot be accepted on account of the position of Ho-si wu.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span></p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX27" href="#NoteAnchor_XX27" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 7.</a>—I suppose the best accessible illustration of the Kaan’s great
      tent may be that in which the Emperor Kienlung received Lord Macartney in
      the same region in 1793, of which one view is given in Staunton’s plates.
      Another exists in the Staunton Collection in the B. M., of which I give a
      reduced sketch.</p>

    <p>Kúblái’s great tent, after all, was but a fraction of the size of Akbar’s
      audience-tents, the largest of which held 10,000 people, and took 1000
      <em>farráshes</em> a week’s work to pitch it, with machines. But perhaps the
      manner of <em>holding</em> people is differently estimated. (<cite>Aín Akb.</cite> 53.)</p>

    <p>In the description of the tent-poles, Pauthier’s text has “<em>trois coulombes
      de fust</em> de pieces <em>moult bien encuierées</em>,” etc. The G.&nbsp;T. has “<em>de
      leing</em> d’especies <em>mout bien curés</em>,” etc. The Crusca, “<em>di</em> spezie <em>molto
      belle</em>,” and Ramusio going off at a tangent, “<em>di legno intagliate con
      grandissimo artificio e indorate</em>.” I believe the translation in the text
      to indicate the true reading. It might mean camphor-wood, or the like. The
      tent-covering of tiger-skins is illustrated by a passage in Sanang Setzen,
      which speaks of a tent covered with panther-skins, sent to Chinghiz by the
      Khan of the Solongos (p. 77).</p>

      <div class="caption">The Tents of the Emperor Kienlung.</div>
    </div>

    <p>[Grenard (pp. 160–162) gives us his experience of Tents in Central Asia
      (Khotan). “These Tents which we had purchased at Tashkent were the
      ‘tentes-abris’ which are used in campaign by Russian military workshops,
      only we made them larger by a third. They were made of grey Kirghiz felt,
      which cannot be procured at Khotan. The felt manufactured in this town not
      having enough consistency or solidity, we took Aksu felt, which is better
      than this of Khotan, though inferior to the felt of Russian Turkestan.
      These felt tents are extremely heavy, and, once damp, are dried with
      difficulty. These drawbacks are not compensated by any important advantage;
      it would be an illusion to believe that they preserve from the cold any
      better than other tents. In fact, I prefer the Manchu tent in use in the
      Chinese army, which is, perhaps, of all military tents the most practical
      and comfortable. It is made of a single piece of double cloth of cotton,
      very strong, waterproof for a long time, white inside, blue outside, and
      weighs with its three tipped sticks and its wooden poles, 25 kilog. Set
      up, it forms a ridge roof 7 feet high and shelters fully ten men. It suits
      servants perfectly well. For the master who wants to work, to write, to
      draw, occasionally to receive officials, the ideal tent would be one of
      the same material, but of larger proportions, and comprising two parallel
      vertical partitions and surmounted by a ridge roof. The round form of
      Kirghiz and Mongol tents is also very comfortable, but it requires a
      complicated and inconvenient wooden frame-work, owing to which it takes
      some considerable time to raise up the tent.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX28" href="#NoteAnchor_XX28" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span>
      8.</a>—The expressions about the sable run in the G.&nbsp;T., “<em>et l’apellent
      les <span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>Tartarz les</em> roi des pelaines,” etc. This has been curiously
      misunderstood both in versions based on Pipino, and in the Geog. Latin and
      Crusca Italian. The Geog. Latin gives us “<em>vocant eas Tartari</em> Lenoidae
      Pellonae”; the Crusca, “<em>chiamanle li Tartari</em> Leroide Pelame”; Ramusio in
      a very odd way combines both the genuine and the blundered interpretation:
      “<em>E li Tartari la chiamano</em> Regina delle Pelli; <em>e gli animali si chiamano</em>
      Rondes.” Fraehn ingeniously suggested that this <em>Rondes</em> (which proves to
      be merely a misunderstanding of the French words <em>Roi des</em>) was a mistake
      for <em>Kunduz</em>, usually meaning a “beaver,” but also a “sable.” (See <cite>Ibn
      Foszlan</cite>, p. 57.) <em>Condux</em>, no doubt with this meaning, appears coupled
      with <em>vair</em>, in a Venetian Treaty with Egypt (1344), quoted by Heyd. (II. 208.)</p>

    <p>Ibn Batuta puts the ermine above the sable. An ermine pelisse, he says, was
      worth in India 1000 dinárs of that country, whilst a sable one was worth
      only 400 dinárs. As Ibn Batuta’s Indian dinárs are <em>Rupees</em>, the estimate
      of price is greatly lower than Polo’s. Some years ago I find the price of a
      <em>Sack</em>, as it is technically called by the Russian traders, or robe of fine
      sables, stated to be in the Siberian market about 7000 banco rubels, <i>i.e.</i>
      I believe about 350<i>l.</i> The same authority mentions that in 1591 the Tzar
      Theodore Ivanovich made a present of a pelisse valued at the equivalent
      of 5000 <em>silver</em> rubels of modern Russian money, or upwards of 750<i>l.</i>
      Atkinson speaks of a <em>single</em> sable skin of the highest quality, for which
      the trapper demanded 18<i>l.</i> The great mart for fine sables is at Olekma
      on the Lena. (See <cite>I. B.</cite> II. 401–402; <cite>Baer’s Beiträge</cite>, VII. 215 <i>seqq.</i>;
      <cite>Upper and Lower Amoor</cite>, 390.)</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XX29" href="#NoteAnchor_XX29" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 9.</a>—Hawking is still common in North China. Pétis de la Croix the
      elder, in his account of the <em>Yasa</em>, or institutes of Chinghiz, quotes one
      which lays down that between March and October “no one should take stags,
      deer, roebucks, hares, wild asses, nor some certain birds,” in order that
      there might be ample sport in winter for the court. This would be just the
      reverse of Polo’s statement, but I suspect it is merely a careless adoption
      of the latter. There are many such traps in Pétis de la Croix. (Engl. Vers.
      1722, p. 82.)</p>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> arriving at his capital of Cambaluc,<a id="NoteAnchor_XXI21" href="#Note_XXI21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> he stays in his palace
    there three days and no more; during which time he has great court
    entertainments and rejoicings, and makes merry with his wives. He then
    quits his palace at Cambaluc, and proceeds to that city which he has built,
    as I told you before, and which is called Chandu, where he has that grand
    park and palace of cane, and where he keeps his gerfalcons in mew. There
    he spends the summer, to escape the heat, for the situation is a very cool
    one. After stopping there from the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>beginning of May to the 28th of August,
    he takes his departure (that is the time when they sprinkle the white
    mares’ milk as I told you), and returns to his capital Cambaluc. There
    he stops, as I have told you also, the month of September, to keep his
    Birthday Feast, and also throughout October, November, December, January,
    and February, in which last month he keeps the grand feast of the New
    Year, which they call the White Feast, as you have heard already with all
    particulars. He then sets out on his march towards the Ocean Sea, hunting
    and hawking, and continues out from the beginning of March to the middle
    of May; and then comes back for three days only to the capital, during
    which he makes merry with his wives, and holds a great court and grand
    entertainments. In truth, ’tis something astonishing, the magnificence
    displayed by the Emperor in those three days; and then he starts off again
    as you know.</p>

  <p>Thus his whole year is distributed in the following manner: six months
    at his chief palace in the royal city of Cambaluc, to wit, <em>September</em>,
    <em>October</em>, <em>November</em>, <em>December</em>, <em>January</em>, <em>February</em>;</p>

  <p>Then on the great hunting expedition towards the sea, <em>March</em>, <em>April</em>, <em>May</em>;</p>

  <p>Then back to his palace at Cambaluc for <em>three days</em>;</p>

  <p>Then off to the city of Chandu which he has built, and where the Cane
    Palace is, where he stays <em>June</em>, <em>July</em>, <em>August</em>;</p>

  <p>Then back again to his capital city of Cambaluc.</p>

  <p>So thus the whole year is spent; six months at the capital, three months
    in hunting, and three months at the Cane Palace to avoid the heat. And in
    this way he passes his time with the greatest enjoyment; not to mention
    occasional journeys in this or that direction at his own pleasure.</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the City of Cambaluc, and its Great Traffic and Population.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> must know that the city of Cambaluc hath such a multitude of houses,
    and such a vast population inside the walls and outside, that it seems
    quite past all possibility. There is a suburb outside each of the gates,
    which are twelve in number;<a id="NoteAnchor_XXII21" href="#Note_XXII21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> and these suburbs are so great that
    they contain more people than the city itself [for the suburb of one gate
    spreads in width till it meets the suburb of the next, whilst they extend
    in length some three or four miles]. In those suburbs lodge the foreign
    merchants and travellers, of whom there are always great numbers who have
    come to bring presents to the Emperor, or to sell articles at Court, or
    because the city affords so good a mart to attract traders. [There are
    in each of the suburbs, to a distance of a mile from the city, numerous
    fine hostelries<a id="NoteAnchor_XXII22" href="#Note_XXII22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> for the lodgment of merchants from different parts
    of the world, and a special hostelry is assigned to each description of
    people, as if we should say there is one for the Lombards, another for the
    Germans, and a third for the Frenchmen.] And thus there are as many good
    houses outside of the city as inside, without counting those that belong to
    the great lords and barons, which are very numerous.</p>

  <div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i413">

      on the north-west.</div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span></p>

  <p>You must know that it is forbidden to bury any dead body inside the city.
    If the body be that of an Idolater it is carried out beyond the city and
    suburbs to a remote place assigned for the purpose, to be burnt. And if it
    be of one belonging to a religion the custom of which is to bury, such as
    the Christian, the Saracen, or what not, it is also carried out beyond the
    suburbs to a distant place assigned for the purpose. And thus the city is
    preserved in a better and more healthy state.</p>

  <p>Moreover, no public woman resides inside the city, but all such abide
    outside in the suburbs. And ’tis wonderful what a vast number of these
    there are for the foreigners; it is a certain fact that there are more than
    20,000 of them living by prostitution. And that so many can live in this
    way will show you how vast is the population.</p>

  <p>[Guards patrol the city every night in parties of 30 or 40, looking out for
    any persons who may be abroad at unseasonable hours, <i>i.e.</i> after the great
    bell hath stricken thrice. If they find any such person he is immediately
    taken to prison, and examined next morning by the proper officers. If these
    find him guilty of any misdemeanour they order him a proportionate beating
    with the stick. Under this punishment people sometimes die; but they adopt
    it in order to eschew bloodshed; for their <em>Bacsis</em> say that it is an evil
    thing to shed man’s blood.]</p>

  <p>To this city also are brought articles of greater cost and rarity, and in
    greater abundance of all kinds, than to any other city in the world. For
    people of every description, and from every region, bring things (including
    all the costly wares of India, as well as the fine and precious goods of
    Cathay itself with its provinces), some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>for the sovereign, some for the
    court, some for the city which is so great, some for the crowds of Barons
    and Knights, some for the great hosts of the Emperor which are quartered
    round about; and thus between court and city the quantity brought in is endless.</p>

  <p>As a sample, I tell you, no day in the year passes that there do not enter
    the city 1000 cart-loads of silk alone, from which are made quantities
    of cloth of silk and gold, and of other goods. And this is not to be
    wondered at; for in all the countries round about there is no flax, so
    that everything has to be made of silk. It is true, indeed, that in some
    parts of the country there is cotton and hemp, but not sufficient for
    their wants. This, however, is not of much consequence, because silk is so
    abundant and cheap, and is a more valuable substance than either flax or cotton.</p>

  <p>Round about this great city of Cambaluc there are some 200 other cities
    at various distances, from which traders come to sell their goods and
    buy others for their lords; and all find means to make their sales and
    purchases, so that the traffic of the city is passing great.</p>

  <div class="subh4">[Concerning the Oppressions of Achmath the Bailo, and the Plot that was
    formed against Him.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIII21" href="#Note_XXIII21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> will hear further on how that there are twelve persons appointed who
    have authority to dispose of lands, offices, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>and everything else at their
    discretion. Now one of these was a certain Saracen named <span class="smcap">Achmath</span>, a shrewd
    and able man, who had more power and influence with the Grand Kaan than any
    of the others; and the Kaan held him in such regard that he could do what
    he pleased. The fact was, as came out after his death, that Achmath had so
    wrought upon the Kaan with his sorcery, that the latter had the greatest
    faith and reliance on everything he said, and in this way did everything
    that Achmath wished him to do.</p>

  <p>This person disposed of all governments and offices, and passed sentence on
    all malefactors; and whenever he desired to have any one whom he hated put
    to death, whether with justice or without it, he would go to the Emperor
    and say: “Such an one deserves death, for he hath done this or that against
    your imperial dignity.” Then the Lord would say: “Do as you think right,”
    and so he would have the man forthwith executed. Thus when people saw how
    unbounded were his powers, and how unbounded the reliance placed by the
    Emperor on everything that he said, they did not venture to oppose him in
    anything. No one was so high in rank or power as to be free from the dread
    of him. If any one was accused by him to the Emperor of a capital offence,
    and desired to defend himself, he was unable to bring proofs in his own
    exculpation, for no one would stand by him, as no one dared to oppose
    Achmath. And thus the latter caused many to perish unjustly.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIII22" href="#Note_XXIII22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a></p>

  <p>Moreover, there was no beautiful woman whom he might desire, but he
    got hold of her; if she were unmarried, forcing her to be his wife, if
    otherwise, compelling her to consent to his desires. Whenever he knew of
    any one who had a pretty daughter, certain ruffians of his would go to the
    father, and say: “What say you? Here is this pretty daughter of yours; give
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>her in marriage to the Bailo Achmath (for they called him ‘the Bailo,’ or,
    as we should say, ‘the Vicegerent’),<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIII23" href="#Note_XXIII23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> and we will arrange for his
    giving you such a government or such an office for three years.” And so
    the man would surrender his daughter. And Achmath would go to the Emperor,
    and say: “Such a government is vacant, or will be vacant on such a day.
    So-and-So is a proper man for the post.” And the Emperor would reply: “Do
    as you think best;” and the father of the girl was immediately appointed to
    the government. Thus either through the ambition of the parents, or through
    fear of the Minister, all the beautiful women were at his beck, either
    as wives or mistresses. Also he had some five-and-twenty sons who held
    offices of importance, and some of these, under the protection of their
    father’s name, committed scandals like his own, and many other abominable
    iniquities. This Achmath also had amassed great treasure, for everybody who
    wanted office sent him a heavy bribe.</p>

  <p>In such authority did this man continue for two-and-twenty years. At last
    the people of the country, to wit the Cathayans, utterly wearied with the
    endless outrages and abominable iniquities which he perpetrated against
    them, whether as regarded their wives or their own persons, conspired to
    slay him and revolt against the government. Amongst the rest there was a
    certain Cathayan named Chenchu, a commander of a thousand, whose mother,
    daughter, and wife had all been dishonoured by Achmath. Now this man, full
    of bitter resentment, entered into parley regarding the destruction of the
    Minister with another Cathayan whose name was Vanchu, who was a commander
    of 10,000. They came to the conclusion that the time to do the business
    would be during the Great Kaan’s absence from Cambaluc. For after stopping
    there three months he used to go to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>Chandu and stop there three months; and
    at the same time his son Chinkin used to go away to his usual haunts, and
    this Achmath remained in charge of the city; sending to obtain the Kaan’s
    orders from Chandu when any emergency arose.</p>

  <p>So Vanchu and Chenchu, having come to this conclusion, proceeded to
    communicate it to the chief people among the Cathayans, and then by common
    consent sent word to their friends in many other cities that they had
    determined on such a day, at the signal given by a beacon, to massacre all
    the men with beards, and that the other cities should stand ready to do the
    like on seeing the signal fires. The reason why they spoke of massacring
    the bearded men was that the Cathayans naturally have no beard, whilst
    beards are worn by the Tartars, Saracens, and Christians. And you should
    know that all the Cathayans detested the Grand Kaan’s rule because he set
    over them governors who were Tartars, or still more frequently Saracens,
    and these they could not endure, for they were treated by them just like
    slaves. You see the Great Kaan had not succeeded to the dominion of Cathay
    by hereditary right, but held it by conquest; and thus having no confidence
    in the natives, he put all authority into the hands of Tartars, Saracens,
    or Christians who were attached to his household and devoted to his
    service, and were foreigners in Cathay.</p>

  <p>Wherefore, on the day appointed, the aforesaid Vanchu and Chenchu having
    entered the palace at night, Vanchu sat down and caused a number of lights
    to be kindled before him. He then sent a messenger to Achmath the Bailo,
    who lived in the Old City, as if to summon him to the presence of Chinkin,
    the Great Kaan’s son, who (it was pretended) had arrived unexpectedly.
    When Achmath heard this he was much <span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>surprised, but made haste to go, for
    he feared the Prince greatly. When he arrived at the gate he met a Tartar
    called Cogatai, who was Captain of the 12,000 that formed the standing
    garrison of the City; and the latter asked him whither he was bound so
    late? “To Chinkin, who is just arrived.” Quoth Cogatai, “How can that be?
    How could he come so privily that I know nought of it?” So he followed
    the Minister with a certain number of his soldiers. Now the notion of the
    Cathayans was that, if they could make an end of Achmath, they would have
    nought else to be afraid of. So as soon as Achmath got inside the palace,
    and saw all that illumination, he bowed down before Vanchu, supposing him
    to be Chinkin, and Chenchu who was standing ready with a sword straightway
    cut his head off. As soon as Cogatai, who had halted at the entrance,
    beheld this, he shouted “Treason!” and instantly discharged an arrow at
    Vanchu and shot him dead as he sat. At the same time he called his people
    to seize Chenchu, and sent a proclamation through the city that any one
    found in the streets would be instantly put to death. The Cathayans saw
    that the Tartars had discovered the plot, and that they had no longer
    any leader, since Vanchu was killed and Chenchu was taken. So they kept
    still in their houses, and were unable to pass the signal for the rising
    of the other cities as had been settled. Cogatai immediately dispatched
    messengers to the Great Kaan giving an orderly report of the whole affair,
    and the Kaan sent back orders for him to make a careful investigation, and
    to punish the guilty as their misdeeds deserved. In the morning Cogatai
    examined all the Cathayans, and put to death a number whom he found to be
    ringleaders in the plot. The same thing was done in the other cities, when
    it was found that the plot extended to them also.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span></p>

  <p>After the Great Kaan had returned to Cambaluc he was very anxious to
    discover what had led to this affair, and he then learned all about the
    endless iniquities of that accursed Achmath and his sons. It was proved
    that he and seven of his sons (for they were not all bad) had forced no
    end of women to be their wives, besides those whom they had ravished. The
    Great Kaan then ordered all the treasure that Achmath had accumulated in
    the Old City to be transferred to his own treasury in the New City, and it
    was found to be of enormous amount. He also ordered the body of Achmath to
    be dug up and cast into the streets for the dogs to tear; and commanded
    those of his sons that had followed the father’s evil example to be flayed
    alive.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIII24" href="#Note_XXIII24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p>These circumstances called the Kaan’s attention to the accursed doctrines
    of the Sect of the Saracens, which excuse every crime, yea even murder
    itself, when committed on such as are not of their religion. And seeing
    that this doctrine had led the accursed Achmath and his sons to act as they
    did without any sense of guilt, the Kaan was led to entertain the greatest
    disgust and abomination for it. So he summoned the Saracens and prohibited
    their doing many things which their religion enjoined. Thus, he ordered
    them to regulate their marriages by the Tartar Law, and prohibited their
    cutting the throats of animals killed for food, ordering them to rip the
    stomach in the Tartar way.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXIII22" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIII22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>—The remarks of a Chinese historian on Kúblái’s administration may
      be appropriately quoted here: “Hupilai Han must certainly be regarded as
      one of the greatest princes that ever existed, and as one of the most
      successful in all that he undertook. This he owed to his judgment in the
      selection of his officers, and to his talent for commanding them. He
      carried his arms into the most remote countries, and rendered his name so
      formidable that not a few nations spontaneously submitted to his supremacy.
      Nor was there ever an Empire of such vast extent. He cultivated literature,
      protected its professors, and even thankfully received their advice. Yet he
      never placed a Chinese in his cabinet, and he employed foreigners only as
      Ministers. These, however, he chose with discernment, <em>always excepting the
      Ministers of Finance</em>. He really loved his subjects; and if they were not
      always happy under his government, it is because they took care to conceal
      their sufferings. There were in those days no Public Censors whose duty it
      is to warn the Sovereign of what is going on: and no one dared to speak
      out for fear of the resentment of the Ministers, who were the depositaries
      of the Imperial authority, and the authors of the oppressions under which
      the people laboured. Several Chinese, men of letters and of great ability,
      who lived at Hupilai’s court, might have rendered that prince the greatest
      service in the administration of his dominions, but they never were
      intrusted with any but subordinate offices, and they were not in a position
      to make known the malversations of those public blood-suckers.” (<cite>De
      Mailla</cite>, IX. 459–460.)</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Ahmad</span> was a native of Fenáket (afterwards Sháh-Rúkhia), near the Jaxartes,
      and obtained employment under Kúblái through the Empress Jamui Khatun, who
      had known him before her marriage. To her Court he was originally attached,
      but we find him already employed in high financial office in 1264. Kúblái’s
      demands for money must have been very large, and he eschewed looking too
      closely into the character of his financial agents or the means by which
      they raised money for him. Ahmad was very successful in this, and being
      a man of great talent and address, obtained immense influence over the
      Emperor, until at last nothing was done save by his direction, though he
      always <em>appeared</em> to be acting under the orders of Kúblái. The Chinese
      authorities in Gaubil and De Mailla speak strongly of his oppressions, but
      only in general terms, and without affording such particulars as we derive
      from the text.</p>

    <p>The Hereditary Prince Chingkim was strongly adverse to Ahmad; and some of
      the high Chinese officials on various occasions made remonstrance against
      the Minister’s proceedings; but Kúblái turned a deaf ear to them, and Ahmad
      succeeded in ruining most of his opponents. (<cite>Gaubil</cite>, 141, 143, 151; <cite>De
      Mailla</cite>, IX. 316–317; <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, II. 468–469.)</p>

    <p>[The Rev. W. S. Ament (<cite>Marco Polo in Cambaluc</cite>, 105) writes: “No name is
      more execrated than that of Ah-ha-ma (called Achmath by Polo), a Persian,
      who was chosen to manage the finances of the Empire. He was finally
      destroyed by a combination against him while the Khan was absent with Crown
      Prince Chen Chin, on a visit to Shang Tu.” Achmath has his biography under

      [There was also a Venetian <em>bailo</em> in Syria.—H.&nbsp;C.] But that term itself
      could scarcely have been in use at Cambaluc, even among the handful of
      Franks, to designate the powerful Minister, and it looks as if Marco had
      confounded the word in his own mind with some Oriental term of like sound,
      possibly the Arabic <em>Wáli</em>, “a Prince, Governor of a Province, ... a chief
      Magistrate.” (<cite>F. Johnson.</cite>) In the <cite>Roteiro</cite> of the Voyage of Vasco da

      the chief conspirator’s death, whilst agreeing as to his name and the main
      facts of the episode.</p>

    <p>In the spring of 1282 (Gaubil, 1281) Kúblái and Prince Chingkim had gone
      off as usual to Shangtu, leaving Ahmad in charge at the Capital. The whole
      country was at heart in revolt against his oppressions. Kúblái alone knew,
      or would know, nothing of them.</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">Wangchu</span>, a chief officer of the city, resolved to take the opportunity of
      delivering the Empire from such a curse, and was joined in his enterprise
      by a certain sorcerer called Kao Hoshang. They sent two Lamas to the
      Council Board with a message that the Crown Prince was returning to the
      Capital to take part in certain Buddhist ceremonies, but no credit was
      given to this. Wangchu then, pretending to have received orders from the
      Prince, desired an officer called <span class="smcap">Chang-y</span> (perhaps the Chenchu of Polo’s
      narrative) to go in the evening with a guard of honour to receive him.
      Late at night a message was sent to summon the Ministers, as the Prince
      (it was pretended) had already arrived. They came in haste with Ahmad at
      their head, and as he entered the Palace Wangchu struck him heavily with
      a copper mace and stretched him dead. Wangchu was arrested, or according
      to one account surrendered, though he might easily have escaped, confident
      that the Crown Prince would save his life. Intelligence was sent off
      to Kúblái, who received it at Chaghan-Nor. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_LX1">Book I. ch. lx.</a>) He
      immediately despatched officers to arrest the guilty and bring them to
      justice. Wangchu, Chang-y, and Kao Hoshang were publicly executed at the
      Old City; Wangchu dying like a hero, and maintaining that he had done the
      Empire an important service which would yet be acknowledged. (<cite>De Mailla</cite>,
      IX. 412–413; <cite>Gaubil</cite>, 193–194; <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, II. 470.) [Cf. <cite>G. Phillips</cite>,
      in <cite>T’oung-Pao</cite>, I. p. 220.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXIII25" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIII25" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—And it is a pleasant fact that Messer Marco’s presence, and his
      upright conduct upon this occasion, have not been forgotten in the Chinese
      Annals: “The Emperor having returned from Chaghan-Nor to Shangtu, desired
      <span class="smcap">Polo</span>, Assessor of the Privy Council, to explain the reasons which had led
      Wangchu to commit this murder. Polo spoke with boldness of the crimes
      and oppressions of Ahama (Ahmad), which had rendered him an object of
      detestation throughout the Empire. The Emperor’s eyes were opened, and he
      praised the courage of Wangchu. He complained that those who surrounded
      him, in abstaining from admonishing him of what was going on, had thought
      more of their fear of displeasing the Minister than of the interests of the
      State.” By Kúblái’s order, the body of Ahmad was taken up, his head was
      cut off and publicly exposed, and his body cast to the dogs. His son also
      was put to death with all his family, and his immense wealth confiscated.
      714 persons were punished, one way or other, for their share in Ahmad’s
      malversations. (<cite>De Mailla</cite>, IX. 413–414.)</p>

    <p>What is said near the end of this chapter about the Kaan’s resentment
      against the Saracens has some confirmation in circumstances related
      by Rashiduddin. The refusal of some Mussulman merchants, on a certain
      occasion at Court, to eat of the dishes sent them by the Emperor, gave
      great offence, and led to the revival of an order of Chinghiz, which
      prohibited, under pain of death, the slaughter of animals by cutting
      their throats. This endured for seven years, and was then removed on the
      strong representation made to Kúblái of the loss caused by the cessation
      of the visits of the Mahomedan merchants. On a previous occasion also
      the Mahomedans had incurred disfavour, owing to the ill-will of certain
      Christians, who quoted to Kúblái a text of the Koran enjoining the killing
      of polytheists. The Emperor sent for the Mullahs, and asked them why they
      did not act on the Divine injunction? All they could say was that the time
      was not yet come! Kúblái ordered them for execution, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>and was only appeased
      by the intercession of Ahmad, and the introduction of a divine with more
      tact, who smoothed over obnoxious applications of the text. (<cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, II. 492–493.)</p>

  <div class="subh4">How the Great Kaan causeth the Bark of Trees, made into something like
    Paper, to pass for Money over all his Country.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Now</span> that I have told you in detail of the splendour of this City of the
    Emperor’s, I shall proceed to tell you of the Mint which he hath in the
    same city, in the which he hath his money coined and struck, as I shall
    relate to you. And in doing so I shall make manifest to you how it is that
    the Great Lord may well be able to accomplish even much more than I have
    told you, or am going to tell you, in this Book. For, tell it how I might,
    you never would be satisfied that I was keeping within truth and reason!</p>

  <p>The Emperor’s Mint then is in this same City of Cambaluc, and the way it
    is wrought is such that you might say he hath the Secret of Alchemy in
    perfection, and you would be right! For he makes his money after this
    fashion.</p>

  <p>He makes them take of the bark of a certain tree, in fact of the Mulberry
    Tree, the leaves of which are the food of the silkworms,—these trees being
    so numerous that whole districts are full of them. What they take is a
    certain fine white bast or skin which lies between the wood of the tree
    and the thick outer bark, and this they make into something resembling
    sheets of paper, but black. When these sheets have been prepared they
    are cut up into pieces of different sizes. The smallest of these sizes
    is worth a half tornesel; the next, a little <span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>larger, one tornesel; one,
    a little larger still, is worth half a silver groat of Venice; another a
    whole groat; others yet two groats, five groats, and ten groats. There is
    also a kind worth one Bezant of gold, and others of three Bezants, and so
    up to ten. All these pieces of paper are [issued with as much solemnity
    and authority as if they were of pure gold or silver; and on every piece a
    variety of officials, whose duty it is, have to write their names, and to
    put their seals. And when all is prepared duly, the chief officer deputed
    by the Kaan smears the Seal entrusted to him with vermilion, and impresses
    it on the paper, so that the form of the Seal remains printed upon it in
    red; the Money is then authentic. Any one forging it would be punished with
    death.] And the Kaan causes every year to be made such a vast quantity of
    this money, which costs him nothing, that it must equal in amount all the
    treasure in the world.</p>

  <p>With these pieces of paper, made as I have described, he causes all
    payments on his own account to be made; and he makes them to pass current
    universally over all his kingdoms and provinces and territories, and
    whithersoever his power and sovereignty extends. And nobody, however
    important he may think himself, dares to refuse them on pain of death.
    And indeed everybody takes them readily, for wheresoever a person may go
    throughout the Great Kaan’s dominions he shall find these pieces of paper
    current, and shall be able to transact all sales and purchases of goods by
    means of them just as well as if they were coins of pure gold. And all the
    while they are so light that ten bezants’ worth does not weigh one golden bezant.</p>

  <p>Furthermore all merchants arriving from India or other countries, and
    bringing with them gold or silver or gems and pearls, are prohibited from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>selling to any one but the Emperor. He has twelve experts chosen for this
    business, men of shrewdness and experience in such affairs; these appraise
    the articles, and the Emperor then pays a liberal price for them in those
    pieces of paper. The merchants accept his price readily, for in the first
    place they would not get so good an one from anybody else, and secondly
    they are paid without any delay. And with this paper-money they can buy
    what they like anywhere over the Empire, whilst it is also vastly lighter
    to carry about on their journeys. And it is a truth that the merchants will
    several times in the year bring wares to the amount of 400,000 bezants, and
    the Grand Sire pays for all in that paper. So he buys such a quantity of
    those precious things every year that his treasure is endless, whilst all
    the time the money he pays away costs him nothing at all. Moreover, several
    times in the year proclamation is made through the city that any one who
    may have gold or silver or gems or pearls, by taking them to the Mint shall
    get a handsome price for them. And the owners are glad to do this, because
    they would find no other purchaser give so large a price. Thus the quantity
    they bring in is marvellous, though these who do not choose to do so may
    let it alone. Still, in this way, nearly all the valuables in the country
    come into the Kaan’s possession.</p>

  <p>When any of those pieces of paper are spoilt—not that they are so very
    flimsy neither—the owner carries them to the Mint, and by paying three per
    cent. on the value he gets new pieces in exchange. And if any Baron, or any
    one else soever, hath need of gold or silver or gems or pearls, in order to
    make plate, or girdles, or the like, he goes to the Mint and buys as much
    as he list, paying in this paper-money.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXIV21" href="#Note_XXIV21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>Now you have heard the ways and means whereby the Great Kaan may have,
    and in fact <em>has</em>, more treasure <span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>than all the Kings in the World; and you
    know all about it and the reason why. And now I will tell you of the great
    Dignitaries which act in this city on behalf of the Emperor.</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXIV21" href="#NoteAnchor_XXIV21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—It is surprising to find that, nearly two centuries ago,
      Magaillans, a missionary who had lived many years in China, and was
      presumably a Chinese scholar, should have utterly denied the truth of
      Polo’s statements about the paper-currency of China. Yet the fact even then
      did not rest on Polo’s statement only. The same thing had been alleged in
      the printed works of Rubruquis, Roger Bacon, Hayton, Friar Odoric, the
      Archbishop of Soltania, and Josaphat Barbaro, to say nothing of other
      European authorities that remained in manuscript, or of the numerous
      Oriental records of the same circumstance.</p>

    <p>The issue of paper-money in China is at least as old as the beginning of
      the 9th century. In 1160 the system had gone to such excess that government
      paper equivalent in nominal value to 43,600,000 ounces of silver had been
      issued in six years, and there were local notes besides; so that the Empire
      was flooded with rapidly depreciating paper.</p>

    <p>The <em>Kin</em> or “Golden” Dynasty of Northern Invaders who immediately preceded
      the Mongols took to paper, in spite of their title, as kindly as the native
      sovereigns. Their notes had a course of seven years, after which new notes
      were issued to the holders, with a deduction of 15 per cent.</p>

    <p>The Mongols commenced their issues of paper-money in 1236, long before
      they had transferred the seat of their government to China. Kúblái made
      such an issue in the first year of his reign (1260), and continued to
      issue notes copiously till the end. In 1287 he put out a complete new
      currency, one note of which was to exchange against <em>five</em> of the previous
      series of equal nominal value! In both issues the paper-money was, in
      official valuation, only equivalent to half its nominal value in silver; a
      circumstance not very easy to understand. The paper-money was called <em>Chao</em>.</p>

    <p>The notes of Kúblái’s first issue (1260–1287) with which Polo may be
      supposed most familiar, were divided into three classes; (1) <em>Notes
      of Tens</em>, viz. of 10, 20, 30, and 50 <em>tsien</em> or cash; (2) <em>Notes of
      Hundreds</em>, viz. of 100, 200, and 500 <em>tsien</em>; and (3) <em>Notes of Strings</em>
      or <em>Thousands</em> of cash, or in other words of <em>Liangs</em> or ounces of silver
      (otherwise <em>Tael</em>), viz. of 1000 and 2000 <em>tsien</em>. There were also notes
      printed on silk for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 ounces each, valued at par in
      silver, but these would not circulate. In 1275, it should be mentioned,
      there had been a supplementary issue of small notes for 2, 3, and 5 cash each.</p>

    <p>Marsden states an equation between Marco’s values of the Notes and the
      actual Chinese currency, to which Biot seems to assent. I doubt its
      correctness, for his assumed values of the groat or <em>grosso</em> and tornesel
      are surely wrong. The grosso ran at that time 18 to the gold ducat or
      sequin, and allowing for the then higher relative value of silver, should
      have contained about 5<i>d.</i> of silver. The ducat was also equivalent to 2
      <i>lire</i>, and the <em>tornese</em> (<cite>Romanin</cite>, III. 343) was 4 deniers. Now the denier
      is always, I believe ¹⁄₂₄₀ of the <i>líra</i>. Hence the <em>tornese</em> would be ⁹⁄₆₀
      of the <em>grosso</em>.</p>

    <p>But we are not to look for <em>exact</em> correspondences, when we see Polo
      applying round figures in European coinage to Chinese currency.</p>

    <div class="figcenter illowp65" id="i426">
      <img class="w100" src="images/i426.jpg" alt="" />
      <div class="caption">Bank-Note of the Ming Dynasty.</div>
    </div>

    <p>His bezant notes, I agree with Marsden, here represent the Chinese notes
      for one and more ounces of silver. And here the correspondence of value is
      much nearer than it seems at first sight. The Chinese <em>liang</em> or ounce of
      silver is valued commonly at 6<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, say roundly 80<i>d.</i><a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But the
      relation of gold and silver in civilized Asia was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>then (see ch. I. note
      4, and also <cite>Cathay</cite>, pp. ccl. and 442) as 10 to 1, not, as with us now,
      more than 15 to 1. Wherefore the <em>liang</em> in relation to gold would be worth
      120<i>d.</i> or 10<i>s.</i>, a little over the Venetian ducat and somewhat less than
      the bezant or dínár. We shall then find the table of Chinese issues, as
      compared with Marco’s equivalents, to stand thus:—</p>

    <p class="noindent">Pauthier has given from the Chinese Annals of the Mongol Dynasty a complete
      Table of the Issues of Paper-Money during every year of Kúblái’s reign
      (1260–1294), estimated at their nominal value in <em>Ting</em> or tens of silver
      ounces. The lowest issue was in 1269, of 228,960 <em>ounces</em>, which at the
      rate of 120<i>d.</i> to the ounce (see above) = 114,480<i>l.</i>, and the highest
      was in 1290, viz. 50,002,500 ounces, equivalent at the same estimate to
      25,001,250<i>l.</i>! whilst the total amount in the 34 years was 249,654,290
      ounces or 124,827,144<i>l.</i> in nominal value. Well might Marco speak of the
      vast quantity of such notes that the Great Kaan issued annually!</p>

    <p>To complete the history of the Chinese paper-currency so far as we can:</p>

    <p>In 1309, a new issue took place with the same provision as in Kúblái’s
      issue of 1287, <i>i.e.</i> each note of the new issue was to exchange against 5 of
      the old of the same nominal value. And it was at the same time prescribed
      that the notes should exchange at par with metals, which of course it was
      beyond the power of Government to enforce, and so the notes were abandoned.
      Issues continued from time to time to the end of the Mongol Dynasty. The
      paper-currency is spoken of by Odoric (1320–30), by Pegolotti (1330–40),
      and by Ibn Batuta (1348), as still the chief, if not sole, currency of the
      Empire. According to the Chinese authorities, the credit of these issues
      was constantly diminishing, as it is easy to suppose. But it is odd that
      all the Western Travellers speak as if the notes were as good as gold.
      Pegolotti, writing for mercantile men, and from the information (as we may
      suppose) of mercantile men, says explicitly that there was no depreciation.</p>

    <p>The Ming Dynasty for a time carried on the system of paper-money; with
      the difference that while under the Mongols no other currency had been
      admitted, their successors made payments in notes, but accepted only hard
      cash from their people!<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
      In 1448 the <em>chao</em> of 1000 cash was worth but 3.
      Barbaro still heard talk of the Chinese paper-currency from travellers whom
      he met at Azov about this time; but after 1455 there is said to be no more
      mention of it in Chinese history.</p>

    <p>I have never heard of the preservation of any note of the Mongols; but
      some of the Ming survive, and are highly valued as curiosities in China.
      The late Sir G.&nbsp;T. Staunton appears to have possessed one; Dr. Lockhart
      formerly had two, of which he gave one to Sir Harry Parkes, and retains
      the other. The paper is so dark as to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>explain Marco’s description of
      it as black. By Dr. Lockhart’s kindness I am enabled to give a reduced
      representation of this note, as near a facsimile as we have been able to
      render it, but with some <em>restoration</em>, <i>e.g.</i> of the <em>seals</em>, of which on
      the original there is the barest indication remaining.</p>

    <p>[Mr. Vissering (<cite>Chinese Currency</cite>, Addenda, I.–III.) gives a facsimile
      and a description of a Chinese banknote of the Ming Dynasty belonging to
      the collection of the Asiatic Museum of the Academy of Sciences at St.
      Petersburg. “In the eighth year of the period <em>Hung-wu</em> (1375), the Emperor
      Tai-tsu issued an order to his minister of finances to make the <em>Pao-tsao</em>
      (precious bills) of the <em>Ta-Ming</em> Dynasty, and to employ as raw material
      for the composition of those bills the fibres of the mulberry tree.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the disuse of Government issues of paper-money from that
      time till recent years, there had long been in some of the cities of China
      a large use of private and local promissory notes as currency. In Fuchau
      this was especially the case; bullion was almost entirely displaced, and
      the banking-houses in that city were counted by hundreds. These were
      under no government control; any individual or company having sufficient
      capital or credit could establish a bank and issue their bills, which
      varied in amount from 100 cash to 1000 dollars. Some fifteen years ago the
      Imperial Government seems to have been induced by the exhausted state of
      the Treasury, and these large examples of the local use of paper-currency,
      to consider projects for resuming that system after the disuse of four
      centuries. A curious report by a Committee of the Imperial Supreme Council,
      on a project for such a currency, appears among the papers published by the
      Russian Mission at Peking. It is unfavourable to the particular project,
      but we gather from other sources that the Government not long afterwards
      did open banks in the large cities of the Empire for the issue of a new
      paper-currency, but that it met with bad success. At Fuchau, in 1858, I
      learn from one notice, the dollar was worth from 18,000 to 20,000 cash in
      Government Bills. Dr. Rennie, in 1861, speaks of the dollar at Peking as
      valued at 15,000, and later at 25,000 paper cash. Sushun, the Regent, had
      issued a vast number of notes through banks of his own in various parts of
      Peking. These he failed to redeem, causing the failure of all the banks,
      and great consequent commotion in the city. The Regent had led the Emperor
      [Hien Fung] systematically into debauched habits which ended in paralysis.
      On the Emperor’s death the Empress caused the arrest and execution of
      Sushun. His conduct in connection with the bank failures was so bitterly
      resented that when the poor wretch was led to execution (8th November,
      1861), as I learn from an eye-witness, the defrauded creditors lined the
      streets and cheered.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

    <p>The Japanese also had a paper-currency in the 14th century. It is different
      in form from that of China. That figured by Siebold is a strip of strong
      paper doubled, 6¼ in. long by 1¾ in. wide, bearing a representation of
      the tutelary god of riches, with long inscriptions in Chinese characters,
      seals in black and red, and an indication of value in ancient Japanese
      characters. I do not learn whether notes of considerable amount are still
      used in Japan; but Sir R. Alcock speaks of banknotes for small change from
      30 to 500 cash and more, as in general use in the interior.</p>

    <p>Two notable and disastrous attempts to imitate the Chinese system of
      currency took place in the Middle Ages; one of them in Persia, apparently
      in Polo’s very presence, the other in India some 36 years later.</p>

    <p>The first was initiated in 1294 by the worthless Kaikhatu Khan, when his
      own and his ministers’ extravagance had emptied the Treasury, on the
      suggestion of a financial officer called ’Izzuddín Muzaffar. The notes were
      direct copies of Kúblái’s, even the Chinese characters being imitated as
      part of the device upon them.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
      The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>Chinese name <em>Chao</em> was applied to
      them, and the Mongol Resident at Tabriz, Pulad Chingsang, was consulted
      in carrying out the measure. Expensive preparations were made for this
      object; offices called <em>Cháo-Khánahs</em> were erected in the principal cities
      of the provinces, and a numerous staff appointed to carry out the details.
      Ghazan Khan in Khorasan, however, would have none of it, and refused to
      allow any of these preparations to be made within his government. After the
      constrained use of the Chao for two or three days Tabriz was in an uproar;
      the markets were closed; the people rose and murdered ’Izzuddín; and the
      whole project had to be abandoned. Marco was in Persia at this time, or
      just before, and Sir John Malcolm not unnaturally suggests that he might
      have had something to do with the scheme; a suggestion which excites a
      needless commotion in the breast of M. Pauthier. We may draw from the story
      the somewhat notable conclusion that <em>Block-printing</em> was practised, at
      least for this one purpose, at Tabriz in 1294.</p>

    <p>The other like enterprise was that of Sultan Mahomed Tughlak of Delhi, in
      1330–31. This also was undertaken for like reasons, and was in professed
      imitation of the Chao of Cathay. Mahomed, however, used copper tokens
      instead of paper; the copper being made apparently of equal weight to the
      gold or silver coin which it represented. The system seems to have had a
      little more vogue than at Tabriz, but was speedily brought to an end by the
      ease with which forgeries on an enormous scale were practised. The Sultan,
      in hopes of reviving the credit of his currency, ordered that every one
      bringing copper tokens to the Treasury should have them cashed in gold or
      silver. “The people who in despair had flung aside their copper coins like
      stones and bricks in their houses, all rushed to the Treasury and exchanged
      them for gold and silver. In this way the Treasury soon became empty, but
      the copper coins had as little circulation as ever, and a very grievous
      blow was given to the State.”</p>

    <p>An odd issue of currency, not of paper, but of leather, took place in Italy
      a few years before Polo’s birth. The Emperor Frederic II., at the siege of
      Faenza in 1241, being in great straits for money, issued pieces of leather
      stamped with the mark of his mint at the value of his Golden Augustals.
      This leather coinage was very popular, especially at Florence, and it was
      afterwards honourably redeemed by Frederic’s Treasury. Popular tradition in
      Sicily reproaches William the Bad among his other sins with having issued
      money of leather, but any stone is good enough to cast at a dog with such a surname.</p>

    <p>[Ma Twan-lin mentions that in the fourth year of the period Yuen Show (<span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
      119), a currency of white metal and <em>deer-skin</em> was made. Mr. Vissering
      (<cite>Chinese Currency</cite>, 38) observes that the skin-tallies “were purely
      tokens, and have had nothing in common with the leather-money, which was,
      during a long time, current in Russia. This Russian skin-money had a truly
      representative character, as the parcels were used instead of the skins
      from which they were cut; the skins themselves being too bulky and heavy
      to be constantly carried backward and forward, only a little piece was cut
      off, to figure as a token of possession of the whole skin. The ownership of
      the skin was proved when the piece fitted in the hole.”</p>

    <p>Mr. Rockhill (<cite>Rubruck</cite>, 201 note) says: “As early as <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 118, we find
      the Chinese using ‘leather-money’ (<em>p’i pi</em>). These were pieces of white
      deer-skin, a foot square, with a coloured border. Each had a value of
      40,000 cash. (<cite>Ma Twan-lin</cite>, Bk. 8, 5.)”</p>

    <p>Mr. Charles F. Keary (<cite>Coins and Medals</cite>, by S. Lane Poole, 128) mentions
      that “in the reign of Elizabeth there was a very extensive issue of private
      tokens in lead, tin, latten, and <em>leather</em>.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[“Without doubt the Mongols borrowed the bank-note system from the Kin. Up
      to the present time there is in Si-ngan-fu a block kept, which was used
      for printing the bank-notes of the Kin Dynasty. I have had the opportunity
      of seeing a print of those bank-notes, they were of the same size and
      shape as the bank-notes of the Ming. A reproduction of the text of the
      Kin bank-notes is found in the <cite>Kin shi ts’ui pien</cite>. This copy has the
      characters <em>pao küan</em> (precious charter) and the years of reign <cite>Chêng
      Yew</cite>, 1213–1216. The first essay of the Mongols to introduce bank-notes
      dates from the time of Ogodai Khan (1229–1242), but Chinese history only
      mentions the fact without giving details. At that time silk in skeins was
      the only article of a determinate value in the trade and on the project of
      <em>Ye lü ch’u ts’ai</em>, minister of Ogodai, the taxes were also collected in
      silk delivered by weight. It can therefore be assumed that the name <em>sze
      ch’ao</em> (<i>i.e.</i> bank-notes referring to the weight of silk) dates back to the
      same time. At any rate, at a later time, as, under the reign of Kubilai,
      the issuing of banknotes was decreed, silk was taken as the standard to
      express the value of silver and 1000 <em>liang</em> silk was estimated = 50
      <em>liang</em> (or 1 <em>ting</em>) silver. Thus, in consequence of those measures, it
      gradually became a rule to transfer the taxes and rents originally paid in
      silk, into silver. The wealth of the Mongol Khans in precious metals was
      renowned. The accounts regarding their revenues, however, which we meet
      with occasionally in Chinese history, do not surprise by their vastness.
      In the year 1298, for instance, the amount of the revenue is stated in the
      <cite>Siu t’ung Kien</cite> to have been:—</p>

    <p>19,000 <em>liang</em> of gold = (190,000 <em>liang</em> of silver, according to the
    exchange of that time at the rate of 1 to 10).</p>

    <p>60,000 <em>liang</em> of silver.</p>

    <p>3,600,000 <em>ting</em> of silver in bank-notes (<i>i.e.</i> 180 millions <i>liang</i>);
      altogether 180,250,000 <i>liang</i> of silver.</p>

    <p>The number seems indeed very high for that time. But if the exceedingly low
      exchange of the bank-notes be taken into consideration, the sum will be
      reduced to a modest amount.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, pp. 50–51.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>[Dr. Bretschneider (<cite>Hist. Bot. Disc.</cite>, I. p. 4) makes the following
      remark:—“Polo states (I. 409) that the Great Kaan causeth the bark of great
      Mulberry-trees, made into something like paper, to pass for money.” He
      seems to be mistaken. Paper in China is not made from mulberry-trees but
      from the <i>Broussonetia papyrifera</i>, which latter tree belongs to the same
      order of Moraceae. The same fibres are used also in some parts of China for
      making cloth, and Marco Polo alludes probably to the same tree when stating
      (II. 108) “that in the province of Cuiju (Kwei chau) they manufacture stuff
      of the bark of certain trees, which form very fine summer clothing.”—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Twelve Barons who are set over all the Affairs of the Great Kaan.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> must know that the Great Kaan hath chosen twelve great Barons to whom
    he hath committed all the necessary affairs of thirty-four great provinces;
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>now I will tell you particulars about them and their establishments.</p>

  <p>You must know that these twelve Barons reside all together in a very rich
    and handsome palace, which is inside the city of Cambaluc, and consists of
    a variety of edifices, with many suites of apartments. To every province is
    assigned a judge and several clerks, and all reside in this palace, where
    each has his separate quarters. These judges and clerks administer all the
    affairs of the provinces to which they are attached, under the direction
    of the twelve Barons. Howbeit, when an affair is of very great importance,
    the twelve Barons lay in before the Emperor, and he decides as he thinks
    best. But the power of those twelve Barons is so great that they choose the
    governors for all those thirty-four great provinces that I have mentioned,
    and only after they have chosen do they inform the Emperor of their choice.
    This he confirms, and grants to the person nominated a tablet of gold such
    as is appropriate to the rank of his government.</p>

  <p>Those twelve Barons also have such authority that they can dispose of the
    movements of the forces, and send them whither, and in such strength, as
    they please. This is done indeed with the Emperor’s cognizance, but still
    the orders are issued on their authority. They are styled <span class="smcap">Shieng</span>, which is
    as much as to say “The Supreme Court,” and the palace where they abide is
    also called <em>Shieng</em>. This body forms the highest authority at the Court
    of the Great Kaan; and indeed they can favour and advance whom they will.
    I will not now name the thirty-four provinces to you, because they will be
    spoken of in detail in the course of this Book.<a id="NoteAnchor_1" href="#Note_1" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_1" href="#NoteAnchor_1" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—Pauthier’s extracts from the Chinese Annals of the Dynasty, in
      illustration of this subject, are interesting. These, as he represents
      them, show the Council <span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>of Ministers usually to have consisted of twelve
      high officials, viz.: two <em>Ch’ing-siang</em> [<span lang="zh">丞 相</span>] or (chief) ministers of
      state, one styled, “of the Right,” and the other “of the Left”; four called
      <em>P’ing-chang ching-ssé</em>, which seems to mean something like ministers in
      charge of special departments; four assistant ministers; two Counsellors.</p>

    <p>Rashiduddin, however, limits the Council to the first two classes:
      “Strictly speaking, the Council of State is composed of four Ch’ing-sang
      (<em>Ch’ing-siang</em>) or great officers (<em>Wazírs</em> he afterwards terms them), and
      four Fanchán (<em>P’ing-chang</em>) or associated members, taken from the nations
      of the Tajiks, Cathayans, Ighurs, and Arkaun” (<i>i.e.</i> Nestorian Christians).
      (Compare <a href="#Page_418">p. 418</a>, <i>supra</i>.)</p>

    <p>[A Samarkand man, Seyyd Tadj Eddin Hassan ben el Khallal, quoted in
      the <cite>Masálak al Absár</cite>, says: “Near the Khan are two amírs who are his
      ministers; they are called <em>Djing San</em> <span lang="ar">جينكصان</span> (Ch’ing-siang). After
      them come the two <em>Bidjan</em> <span lang="ar">بجان</span> (P’ing Chang), then the two <em>Zoudjin</em>
      <span lang="ar">زوجين</span> (Tso Chen), then the two <em>Yudjin</em> <span lang="ar">يوجين</span> (Yu Chen), and at last
      the <em>Landjun</em> <span lang="ar">لنجون</span> (Lang Chang), head of the scribes, and secretary of
      the sovereign. The Khan holds a sitting every day in the middle of a large
      building called <em>Chen</em> <span lang="ar">شن</span> (Sheng), which is very like our Palace of
      Justice.” (<cite>C. Schefer, Cent. Ec. Langues Or.</cite>, pp. 18–19.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>In a later age we find the twelve Barons reappearing in the pages of
      Mendoza: “The King hath in this city of Tabin (Peking), where he is
      resident, a royal council of twelve counsellors and a president, chosen men
      throughout all the kingdom, and such as have had experience in government
      many years.” And also in the early centuries of the Christian era we hear
      that the Khan of the Turks had his twelve grandees, divided into those of
      the Right and those of the Left, probably a copy from a Chinese order then
      also existing.</p>

    <p>But to return to Rashiduddin: “As the Kaan generally resides at the
      capital, he has erected a place for the sittings of the Great Council,
      called <em>Sing</em>.... The dignitaries mentioned above are expected to attend
      daily at the Sing, and to make themselves acquainted with all that passes there.”</p>

    <p>The <em>Sing</em> of Rashid is evidently the Shieng or Sheng (<em>Scieng</em>) of Polo.
      M. Pauthier is on this point somewhat contemptuous towards Neumann, who,
      he says, confounds Marco Polo’s twelve Barons or Ministers of State with
      the chiefs of the twelve great provincial governments called <em>Sing</em>, who
      had their residence at the chief cities of those governments; whilst in
      fact Polo’s <em>Scieng</em> (he asserts) has nothing to do with the <em>Sing</em>, but
      represents the Chinese word <em>Siang</em> “a minister,” and “the office of a
      minister.” [There was no doubt a confusion between <em>Siang</em> <span lang="zh">相</span> and
      <em>Sheng</em> <span lang="zh">省</span>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>It is very probable that two different words, <em>Siang</em> and <em>Sing</em>, got
      confounded by the non-Chinese attachés of the Imperial Court; but it
      seems to me quite certain that they applied the same word, Sing or Sheng,
      to both institutions, viz. to the High Council of State, and to the
      provincial governments. It also looks as if Marco Polo himself had made
      that very confusion with which Pauthier charges Neumann. For whilst here
      he represents the twelve Barons as forming a Council of State at the
      capital, we find further on, when speaking of the city of Yangchau, he
      says: “<i lang="fr">Et si siet en ceste cité uns des xii Barons du Grant Kaan; car elle
      est esleue pour un des xii sieges</i>,” where the last word is probably a
      mistranscription of <em>Sciengs</em>, or <em>Sings</em>, and in any case the reference is
      to a distribution of the empire into twelve governments.</p>

    <p>To be convinced that <em>Sing</em> was used by foreigners in the double sense that
      I have said, we have only to proceed with Rashiduddin’s account of the
      administration. After what we have already quoted, he goes on: “The <em>Sing</em>
      of Khanbaligh is the most eminent, and the building is very large....
      <em>Sings</em> do not exist in all the cities, but only in the capitals of great
      provinces.... In the whole empire of the Kaan there are twelve of these
      Sings; but that of Khanbaligh is the only one which has Ching-sangs amongst
      its members.” Wassáf again, after describing the greatness of Khanzai
      (Kinsay of Polo) says: “These circumstances characterize the capital
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>itself, but four hundred cities of note, and embracing ample territories,
      are dependent on its jurisdiction, insomuch that the most inconsiderable of
      those cities surpasses Baghdad and Shiraz. In the number of these cities
      are Lankinfu and Zaitun, and Chinkalán; for they call Khanzai a <em>Shing</em>,
      <i>i.e.</i> a great city in which the high and mighty Council of Administration
      holds its meetings.” Friar Odoric again says: “This empire hath been
      divided by the Lord thereof into twelve parts, each one thereof is termed a Singo.”</p>

    <p>Polo, it seems evident to me, knew nothing of Chinese. His <em>Shieng</em> is no
      direct attempt to represent <em>any</em> Chinese word, but simply the term that
      he had been used to employ in talking Persian or Turki, in the way that
      Rashiduddin and Wassáf employ it.</p>

    <p>I find no light as to the thirty-four provinces into which Polo represents
      the empire as divided, unless it be an enumeration of the provinces and
      districts which he describes in the second and third parts of Bk. II., of
      which it is not difficult to reckon thirty-three or thirty-four, but not
      worth while to repeat the calculation.</p>

    <p>[China was then divided into twelve <em>Sheng</em> or provinces: Cheng-Tung,
      Liao-Yang, Chung-Shu, Shen-Si, Ling-Pe (Karakorum), Kan-Suh, Sze-ch’wan,
      Ho-Nan Kiang-Pe, Kiang-Ché, Kiang-Si, Hu-Kwang and Yun-Nan. Rashiduddin
      (<cite>J. As.</cite>, XI. 1883, p. 447) says that of the twelve Sing, Khanbaligh was
      the only one with <em>Chin-siang</em>. We read in <cite>Morrison’s Dict.</cite> (Pt. II.
      vol. i. p. 70): “Chin-seang, a Minister of State, was so called under the
      Ming Dynasty.” According to Mr. E. H. Parker (<cite>China Review</cite>, xxiv. p.
      101), <em>Ching Siang</em> were abolished in 1395. I imagine that the thirty-four
      provinces refer to the <em>Fu</em> cities, which numbered however <em>thirty-nine</em>,
      according to <cite>Oxenham’s Historical Atlas</cite>.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    of those stations used by the messengers, there is a large and handsome
    building for them to put up at, in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>which they find all the rooms furnished
    with fine beds and all other necessary articles in rich silk, and where
    they are provided with everything they can want. If even a king were to
    arrive at one of these, he would find himself well lodged.</p>

  <p>At some of these stations, moreover, there shall be posted some four
    hundred horses standing ready for the use of the messengers; at others
    there shall be two hundred, according to the requirements, and to what
    the Emperor has established in each case. At every twenty-five miles, as
    I said, or anyhow at every thirty miles, you find one of these stations,
    on all the principal highways leading to the different provincial
    governments; and the same is the case throughout all the chief provinces
    subject to the Great Kaan.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVI23" href="#Note_XXVI23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a> Even when the messengers have to pass
    through a roadless tract where neither house nor hostel exists, still
    there the station-houses have been established just the same, excepting
    that the intervals are somewhat greater, and the day’s journey is fixed
    at thirty-five to forty-five miles, instead of twenty-five to thirty. But
    they are provided with horses and all the other necessaries just like those
    we have described, so that the Emperor’s messengers, come they from what
    region they may, find everything ready for them.</p>

  <p>And in sooth this is a thing done on the greatest scale of magnificence
    that ever was seen. Never had emperor, king, or lord, such wealth as
    this manifests! For it is a fact that on all these posts taken together
    there are more than 300,000 horses kept up, specially for the use of the
    messengers. And the great buildings that I have mentioned are more than
    10,000 in number, all richly furnished, as I told you. The thing is on a
    scale so wonderful and costly that it is hard to bring oneself to describe
    it.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVI24" href="#Note_XXVI24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a></p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span></p>

  <p>But now I will tell you another thing that I had forgotten, but which ought
    to be told whilst I am on this subject. You must know that by the Great
    Kaan’s orders there has been established between those post-houses, at
    every interval of three miles, a little fort with some forty houses round
    about it, in which dwell the people who act as the Emperor’s foot-runners.
    Every one of those runners wears a great wide belt, set all over with
    bells, so that as they run the three miles from post to post their bells
    are heard jingling a long way off. And thus on reaching the post the runner
    finds another man similarly equipt, and all ready to take his place, who
    instantly takes over whatsoever he has in charge, and with it receives a
    slip of paper from the clerk, who is always at hand for the purpose; and so
    the new man sets off and runs his three miles. At the next station he finds
    his relief ready in like manner; and so the post proceeds, with a change at
    every three miles. And in this way the Emperor, who has an immense number
    of these runners, receives despatches with news from places ten days’
    journey off in one day and night; or, if need be, news from a hundred days
    off in ten days and nights; and that is no small matter! (In fact in the
    fruit season many a time fruit shall be gathered one morning in Cambaluc,
    and the evening of the next day it shall reach the Great Kaan at Chandu, a
    distance of ten days’ journey.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVI25" href="#Note_XXVI25" class="fnanchor">{5}</a> The clerk at each of the posts notes
    the time of each courier’s arrival and departure; and there are often other
    officers whose business it is to make monthly visitations of all the posts,
    and to punish those runners who have been slack in their work.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVI26" href="#Note_XXVI26" class="fnanchor">{6}</a>) The
    Emperor exempts these men from all tribute, and pays them besides.</p>

  <p>Moreover, there are also at those stations other men equipt similarly with
    girdles hung with bells, who are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>employed for expresses when there is a
    call for great haste in sending despatches to any governor of a province,
    or to give news when any Baron has revolted, or in other such emergencies;
    and these men travel a good two hundred or two hundred and fifty miles in
    the day, and as much in the night. I’ll tell you how it stands. They take a
    horse from those at the station which are standing ready saddled, all fresh
    and in wind, and mount and go at full speed, as hard as they can ride in
    fact. And when those at the next post hear the bells they get ready another
    horse and a man equipt in the same way, and he takes over the letter or
    whatever it be, and is off full-speed to the third station, where again
    a fresh horse is found all ready, and so the despatch speeds along from
    post to post, always at full gallop, with regular change of horses. And
    the speed at which they go is marvellous. (By night, however, they cannot
    go so fast as by day, because they have to be accompanied by footmen with
    torches, who could not keep up with them at full speed.)</p>

  <p>Those men are highly prized; and they could never do it, did they not
    bind hard the stomach, chest and head with strong bands. And each of them
    carries with him a gerfalcon tablet, in sign that he is bound on an urgent
    express; so that if perchance his horse break down, or he meet with other
    mishap, whomsoever he may fall in with on the road, he is empowered to make
    him dismount and give up his horse. Nobody dares refuse in such a case; so
    that the courier hath always a good fresh nag to carry him.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXVI27" href="#Note_XXVI27" class="fnanchor">{7}</a></p>

  <p>Now all these numbers of post-horses cost the Emperor nothing at all; and I
    will tell you the how and the why. Every city, or village, or hamlet, that
    stands near one of those post-stations, has a fixed demand made on it for
    as many horses as it can supply, and these it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>must furnish to the post. And
    in this way are provided all the posts of the cities, as well as the towns
    and villages round about them; only in uninhabited tracts the horses are
    furnished at the expense of the Emperor himself.</p>

  <p>(Nor do the cities maintain the full number, say of 400 horses, always at
    their station, but month by month 200 shall be kept at the station, and
    the other 200 at grass, coming in their turn to relieve the first 200. And
    if there chance to be some river or lake to be passed by the runners and
    horse-posts, the neighbouring cities are bound to keep three or four boats
    in constant readiness for the purpose.)</p>

  <p>And now I will tell you of the great bounty exercised by the Emperor
    towards his people twice a year.</p>

      sense of prudent or judicious. Thus P. della Valle (II. 26), speaking

      word, which the Tartars carried with them all over Asia. It survives in
      Persian and Turki in the senses both of a post-house and a post-horse,
      and in Russia, in the former sense, is a relic of the Mongol dominion.
      The ambassadors of Shah Rukh, on arriving at Sukchu, were lodged in the
      <em>Yám-Khána</em>, or post-house, by the city gate; and they found ninety-nine
      such Yams between Sukchu and Khanbaligh, at each of which they were
      supplied with provisions, servants, beds, night-clothes, etc. Odoric
      likewise speaks of the hostelries called <em>Yam</em>, and Rubruquis applies the
      same term to quarters in the imperial camp, which were assigned for the
      lodgment of ambassadors. (<cite>Cathay</cite>, ccii., 137; <cite>Rubr.</cite> 310.)</p>

      to understand how there should be such a population as all this implies,
      and how they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>can subsist, the answer is that all the Idolaters, and
      Saracens as well, take six, eight, or ten wives apiece when they can afford
      it, and beget an infinity of children. In fact, you shall find many men
      who have each more than thirty sons who form an armed retinue to their
      father, and this through the fact of his having so many wives. With us, on
      the other hand, a man hath but one wife; and if she be barren, still he
      must abide by her for life, and have no progeny; thus we have not such a
      population as they have.</p>

    <p>“And as regards food, they have abundance; for they generally consume rice,
      panic, and millet (especially the Tartars, Cathayans, and people of Manzi);
      and these three crops in those countries render an hundred-fold. Those
      nations use no bread, but only boil those kinds of grain with milk or meat
      for their victual. Their wheat, indeed, does not render so much, but this
      they use only to make vermicelli, and pastes of that description. No spot
      of arable land is left untilled; and their cattle are infinitely prolific,
      so that when they take the field every man is followed by six, eight,

      very much in the same way by Magaillans in the 17th century. Posts had
      existed in China from an old date. They are spoken of by Mas’udi and the
      <cite>Relations</cite> of the 9th century. They were also employed under the ancient
      Persian kings; and they were in use in India, at least in the generation
      after Polo. The Mongols, too, carried the institution wherever they went.</p>

    <p>Polo describes the couriers as changed at short intervals, but more usually
      in Asiatic posts the same man rides an enormous distance. The express
      courier in Tibet, as described by “the Pandit,” rides from Gartokh to
      Lhasa, a distance of 800 miles, travelling day and night. The courier’s
      coat is <em>sealed</em> upon him, so that he dares not take off his clothes
      till the seal is officially broken on his arrival at the terminus. These
      messengers had faces cracked, eyes bloodshot and sunken, and bodies raw
      with vermin. (<cite>J. R. G. S.</cite> XXXVIII. p. 149.) The modern Turkish post from
      Constantinople to Baghdad, a distance of 1100 miles, is done in twenty days
      by four Tartars riding night and day. The changes are at Sivas, Diarbekir,

    are afflicted by any dearth through unfavourable seasons, or storms or

    way no taxes are exacted for that year; nay more, he causes them to be
    supplied with corn of his own for food and seed. Now this is undoubtedly a

    the purpose.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXX21" href="#NoteAnchor_XXX21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—There is a great consumption of coal in Northern China, especially
      in the brick stoves, which are universal, even in poor houses. Coal seems
      to exist in every one of the eighteen provinces of China, which in this
      respect is justly pronounced to be one of the most favoured countries in
      the world. Near the capital coal is mined at Yuen-ming-yuen, and in a
      variety of isolated deposits among the hills in the direction of the Kalgan
      road, and in the district round Siuen-hwa-fu. (<em>Sindachu</em> of Polo, <i>ante</i>
      <a href="#CHAPTER_LIX1">ch. lix.</a>) But the most important coal-fields in relation to the future
      are those of Shan-tung Hu-nan, Ho-nan, and Shan-si. The last is eminently
      <em>the</em> coal and iron province of China, and its coal-field, as described by
      Baron Richthofen, combines, in an extraordinary manner, all the advantages
      that can enhance the value of such a field except (at present) that of
      facile export; whilst the quantity available is so great that from Southern
      Shan-si alone he estimates the whole world could be supplied, at the
      present rate of consumption, for several thousand years. “Adits, miles in
      length, could be driven within the body of the coal.... These extraordinary
      conditions ... will eventually give rise to some curious features in
      mining ... if a railroad should ever be built from the plain to this region
      ... branches of it will be constructed within the body of one or other of
      these beds of anthracite.” Baron Richthofen, in the paper which we quote
      from, indicates the revolution in the deposit of the world’s wealth and
      power, to which such facts, combined with other characteristics of China,
      point as probable; a revolution so vast that its contemplation seems like
      that of a planetary catastrophe.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span></p>

    <p>In the coal-fields of Hu-nan “the mines are chiefly opened where the rivers
      intersect the inclined strata of the coal-measures and allow the coal-beds
      to be attacked by the miner immediately at their out-croppings.”</p>

    <p>At the highest point of the Great Kiang, reached by Sarel and Blakiston,
      they found mines on the cliffs over the river, from which the coal was sent
      down by long bamboo cables, the loaded baskets drawing up the empty ones.</p>

    <p>[Many coal-fields have been explored since; one of the most important is
      the coal-field of the Yun-nan province; the finest deposits are perhaps
      those found in the bend of the Kiang; coal is found also at Mong-Tzŭ,
      Lin-ngan, etc.; this rich coal region has been explored in 1898 by the
      French engineer A. Leclère. (See <cite>Congrès int. Géog.</cite>, Paris, 1900, pp.
      178–184.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>In various parts of China, as in Che-kiang, Sze-ch’wan, and at Peking,
      they form powdered coal, mixed with mud, into bricks, somewhat like our
      “patent fuel.” This practice is noticed by Ibn Batuta, as well as the use
      of coal in making porcelain, though this he seems to have misunderstood.
      Rashiduddin also mentions the use of coal in China. It was in use,
      according to citations of Pauthier’s, before the Christian era. It is a
      popular belief in China, that every provincial capital is bound to be
      established over a coal-field, so as to have a provision in case of siege.
      It is said that during the British siege of Canton mines were opened to the
      north of the city.</p>

      kind were imbued either with brimstone or with some oily matter, so that
      they could be burnt instead of wood, of which the country was destitute.

  <div class="subh4">How the Great Kaan causes Stores of Corn to be made, to help his People
    withal in time of Dearth.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">You</span> must know that when the Emperor sees that corn is cheap and abundant,
    he buys up large quantities, and has it stored in all his provinces in
    great granaries, where it is so well looked after that it will keep for
    three or four years.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXI21" href="#Note_XXXI21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>And this applies, let me tell you, to all kinds of corn, whether wheat,
    barley, millet, rice, panic, or what not, and when there is any scarcity of
    a particular kind of corn, he causes that to be issued. And if the price
    of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>the corn is at one bezant the measure, he lets them have it at a bezant
    for four measures, or at whatever price will produce general cheapness;
    and every one can have food in this way. And by this providence of the
    Emperor’s, his people can never suffer from dearth. He does the same over
    his whole Empire; causing these supplies to be stored everywhere, according
    to calculation of the wants and necessities of the people.</p>

      (Pauthier): “<em>si bien</em> estudier” (G.&nbsp;T.). The word may be <em>estiver</em> (It.
      <em>stivare</em>), to stow, but I half suspect it should be <em>estuver</em> in the
      sense of “kiln-dry,” though both the Geog. Latin and the Crusca render
      it <em>gubernare</em>.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Lecomte says: “Rice is always stored in the public
      granaries for three or four years in advance. It keeps long if care be
      taken to air it and stir it about; and although not so good to the taste or
      look as new rice, it is said to be more wholesome.”</p>

    <p>The Archbishop of Soltania (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1330) speaks of these stores. “The said
      Emperor is very pitiful and compassionate ... and so when there is a dearth
      in the land he openeth his garners, and giveth forth of his wheat and his
      rice for half what others are selling it at.” Kúblái Kaan’s measures of
      this kind are recorded in the annals of the Dynasty, as quoted by Pauthier.
      The same practice is ascribed to the sovereigns of the T’ang Dynasty
      by the old Arab <cite>Relations</cite>. In later days a missionary gives in the
      <cite>Lettres Edifiantes</cite> an unfavourable account of the action of these public
      granaries, and of the rascality that occurred in connection with them.

  <div class="subh4">Of the Charity of the Emperor to the Poor.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I have</span> told you how the Great Kaan provides for the distribution of
    necessaries to his people in time of dearth, by making store in time of
    cheapness. Now I will tell you of his alms and great charity to the poor of
    his city of Cambaluc.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span></p>

  <p>You see he causes selection to be made of a number of families in the city
    which are in a state of indigence, and of such families some may consist of
    six in the house, some of eight, some of ten, more or fewer in each as it
    may hap, but the whole number being very great. And each family he causes
    annually to be supplied with wheat and other corn sufficient for the whole
    year. And this he never fails to do every year. Moreover, all those who
    choose to go to the daily dole at the Court receive a great loaf apiece,
    hot from the baking, and nobody is denied; for so the Lord hath ordered.
    And so some 30,000 people go for it every day from year’s end to year’s
    end. Now this is a great goodness in the Emperor to take pity of his poor
    people thus! And they benefit so much by it that they worship him as he
    were God.</p>

  <p>[He also provides the poor with clothes. For he lays a tithe upon all
    wool, silk, hemp, and the like, from which clothing can be made; and he
    has these woven and laid up in a building set apart for the purpose; and
    as all artizans are bound to give a day’s labour weekly, in this way the
    Kaan has these stuffs made into clothing for those poor families, suitable
    for summer or winter, according to the time of year. He also provides the
    clothing for his troops, and has woollens woven for them in every city,
    the material for which is furnished by the tithe aforesaid. You should
    know that the Tartars, before they were converted to the religion of the
    Idolaters, never practised almsgiving. Indeed, when any poor man begged of
    them they would tell him, “Go with God’s curse, for if He loved you as He
    loves me, He would have provided for you.” But the sages of the Idolaters,
    and especially the <em>Bacsis</em> mentioned before, told the Great Kaan that
    it was a good work to provide for the poor, and that his idols would be
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>greatly pleased if he did so. And since then he has taken to do for the
    poor so much as you have heard.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXII21" href="#Note_XXXII21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a>]</p>

  <div class="subh4">[Concerning the Astrologers in the City of Cambaluc.]</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">[There</span> are in the city of Cambaluc, what with Christians, Saracens, and
    Cathayans, some five thousand astrologers and soothsayers, whom the Great
    Kaan provides with annual maintenance and clothing, just as he provides the
    poor of whom we have spoken, and they are in the constant exercise of their
    art in this city.</p>

  <p>They have a kind of astrolabe on which are inscribed the planetary signs,
    the hours and critical points of the whole year. And every year these
    Christian, Saracen, and Cathayan astrologers, each sect apart, investigate
    by means of this astrolabe the course and character of the whole year,
    according to the indications of each of its Moons, in order to discover
    by the natural course and disposition of the planets, and the other
    circumstances of the heavens, what shall be the nature of the weather, and
    what peculiarities shall be produced by each Moon <span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>of the year; as, for
    example, under which Moon there shall be thunderstorms and tempests, under
    which there shall be disease, murrain, wars, disorders, and treasons, and
    so on, according to the indications of each; but always adding that it
    lies with God to do less or more according to His pleasure. And they write
    down the results of their examination in certain little pamphlets for the
    year, which are called <em>Tacuin</em>, and these are sold for a groat to all who
    desire to know what is coming. Those of the astrologers, of course whose
    predictions are found to be most exact, are held to be the greatest adepts
    in their art, and get the greater fame.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIII21" href="#Note_XXXIII21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a></p>

  <p>And if any one having some great matter in hand, or proposing to make a
    long journey for traffic or other business, desires to know what will be
    the upshot, he goes to one of these astrologers and says: “Turn up your
    books and see what is the present aspect of the heavens, for I am going
    away on such and such a business.” Then the astrologer will reply that the
    applicant must also tell the year, month, and hour of his birth; and when
    he has got that information he will see how the horoscope of his nativity
    combines with the indications of the time when the question is put, and
    then he predicts the result, good or bad, according to the aspect of the
    heavens.</p>

  <p>You must know, too, that the Tartars reckon their years by twelves; the
    sign of the first year being the Lion, of the second the Ox, of the third
    the Dragon, of the fourth the Dog, and so forth up to the twelfth;<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIII22" href="#Note_XXXIII22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a>
    so that when one is asked the year of his birth he answers that it was in
    the year of the Lion (let us say), on such a day or night, at such an hour,
    and such a moment. And the father of a child always takes care to write
    these particulars down in a book. When the twelve yearly symbols have been
    gone through, then they come <span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>back to the first, and go through with them
    again in the same succession.]</p>

  <hr class="r40" />
  <blockquote>
    <p><a id="Note_XXXIII21" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIII21" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 1.</a>—It is odd that Marsden should have sought a Chinese explanation
      of the Arabic word <em>Taḳwím</em> even with Tavernier before him: “They sell in
      Persia an annual almanac called <em>Tacuim</em>, which is properly an ephemeris
      containing the longitude and latitude of the planets, their conjunctions
      and oppositions, and other such matter. The <em>Tacuim</em> is full of predictions
      regarding war, pestilence, and famine; it indicates the favourable time for
      putting on new clothes, for getting bled or purged, for making a journey,
      and so forth. They put entire faith in it, and whoever can afford one
      governs himself in all things by its rules.” (Bk. V. ch. xiv.)</p>

    <p>The use of the term by Marco may possibly be an illustration of what I have
      elsewhere propounded, viz. that he was not acquainted with Chinese, but
      that his intercourse and conversation lay chiefly with the foreigners at
      the Kaan’s Court, and probably was carried on in the Persian language. But
      not long after the date of our Book we find the word used in Italian by
      Jacopo Alighieri (Dante’s son):—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry" lang="it">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">“A voler giudicare</div>

          <div class="i1">Per vedere il cammino</div>
          <div class="i1">Come i Pianeti vanno</div>

          <div class="i10">—<cite>Rime Antiche Toscane</cite>, III. 10.</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Marco does not allude to the fact that almanacs were published by the
      Government, as they were then and still are. Pauthier (515 <i>seqq.</i>) gives
      some very curious details on this subject from the Annals of the Yuen.
      In the accounts of the year 1328, it appears that no less than 3,123,185
      copies were printed in three different sizes at different prices, besides a
      separate almanac for the <em>Hwei-Hwei</em> or Mahomedans. Had Polo not omitted to
      touch on the issue of almanacs by Government he could scarcely have failed
      to enter on the subject of printing, on which he has kept a silence so
      singular and unaccountable.</p>

    <p>The Chinese Government still “considers the publication of a Calendar of
      the first importance and utility. It must do everything in its power,
      not only to point out to its numerous subjects the distribution of the
      seasons, ... but on account of the general superstition it must mark in the
      almanac the lucky and unlucky days, the best days for being married, for
      undertaking a journey, for making their dresses, for buying or building,
      for presenting petitions to the Emperor, and for many other cases of
      ordinary life. By this means the Government keeps the people within the
      limits of humble obedience; it is for this reason that the Emperors
      of China established the Academy of Astronomy.” (<cite>Timk.</cite> I. 358.) The
      acceptance of the Imperial Almanac by a foreign Prince is considered an
      acknowledgment of vassalage to the Emperor.</p>

    <p>It is a penal offence to issue a pirated or counterfeit edition of the
      Government Almanac. No one ventures to be without one, lest he become
      liable to the greatest misfortunes by undertaking the important measures on
      black-balled days.</p>

    <p>The price varies now, according to Williams, from 1½<i>d.</i> to 5<i>d.</i> a copy.
      The price in 1328 was 1 <em>tsien</em> or cash for the cheapest edition, and 1
      <em>liang</em> or tael of silver for the <em>édition de luxe</em>; but as these prices
      were in paper-money it is extremely difficult to say, in the varying
      depreciation of that currency, what the price really amounted to.</p>

    <p>[“The Calendars for the use of the people, published by Imperial command,
      are of two kinds. The first, <em>Wan-nien-shu, the Calendar of Ten Thousand
      Years</em>, is an abridgment of the Calendar, comprising 397 years, viz.
      from 1624 to 2020. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>second and more complete Calendar is the <em>Annual
      Calendar</em>, which, under the preceding dynasties, was named <em>Li-je, Order of
      Days</em>, and is now called <em>Shih-hsien-shu, Book of Constant Conformity (with
      the Heavens)</em>. This name was given by the Emperor <em>Shun-chih</em>, in the first
      year of his reign (1644), on being presented by Father John Schall (<em>Tang
      Jo-wang</em>) with a new Calendar, calculated on the principles of European
      science. This <em>Annual Calendar</em> gives the following indications: (1°) The
      cyclical signs of the current year, of the months, and of all the days;
      (2°) the <em>long</em> and <em>short</em> months, as well as the <em>intercalary</em> month, as
      the case may be; (3°) the designation of each day by the 5 <em>elements</em>, the
      28 constellations, and the 12 <em>happy presages</em>; (4°) the day and hour of
      the new moon, of the full moon, and of the two dichotomies, <em>Shang-hsien</em>
      and <em>Hsia-hsien</em>; (5°) the day and hour for the <em>positions</em> of the sun in
      the 24 zodiacal signs, calculated for the various capitals of China as
      well as for Manchuria, Mongolia, and the tributary Kingdoms; (6°) the hour
      of sunrise and sunset and the length of day and night for the principal
      days of the month in the several capitals; (7°) various superstitious
      indications purporting to point out what days and hours are auspicious
      or not for such or such affairs in different places. Those superstitious
      indications are stated to have been introduced into the Calendar under the
      <em>Yüan</em> dynasty.” (<cite>P. Hoang, Chinese Calendar</cite>, pp. 2–3.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>We may note that in Polo’s time one of the principal officers of the
      Mathematical Board was <em>Gaisue</em>, a native of <em>Folin</em> or the Byzantine
      Empire, who was also in charge of the medical department of the Court.
      Regarding the Observatory, see note at <a href="#Page_378">p. 378</a>, <i>supra</i>.</p>

    <p>And I am indebted yet again to the generous zeal of Mr. Wylie of Shanghai,
      for the principal notes and extracts which will, I trust, satisfy others as
      well as myself that the instruments in the garden of the Observatory belong
      to the period of Marco Polo’s residence in China.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

    <p>The objections to the alleged age of these instruments were entirely based
      on an inspection of photographs. The opinion was given very strongly that
      no instrument of the kind, so perfect in theory and in execution, could
      have been even imagined in those days, and that nothing of such scientific
      quality could have been made except by the Jesuits. In fact it was asserted
      or implied that these instruments must have been made about the year
      1700, and were therefore not earlier in age than those which stand on the
      terraced roof of the Observatory, and are well known to most of us from the
      representation in Duhalde and in many popular works.</p>

    <p>The only authority that I could lay hand on was Lecomte, and what he says
      was not conclusive. I extract the most pertinent passages:</p>

    <p>“It was on the terrace of the tower that the Chinese astronomers had set
      their instruments, and though few in number they occupied the whole area.
      But Father Verbiest, the Director of the Observatory, considering them
      useless for astronomical observation, persuaded the Emperor to let them
      be removed, to make way for several instruments of his own construction.
      The instruments set aside by the European astronomers are still in a hall
      adjoining the tower, buried in dust and oblivion; and we saw them only
      through a grated window. They appeared to us to be very large and well
      cast, in form approaching our astronomical circles; that is all that we
      could make out. There was, however, thrown into a back yard by itself, a
      celestial globe of bronze, of about 3 feet in diameter. Of this we were
      able to take a nearer view. Its form was somewhat oval; the divisions by no
      means exact, and the whole work coarse enough.</p>

    <p>“Besides this in a lower hall they had established a gnomon.... This
      observatory, not worthy of much consideration for its ancient instruments,
      much less for its situation, its form, or its construction, is now enriched
      by several bronze instruments which Father Verbiest has placed there. These
      are large, well cast, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>adorned in every case with figures of dragons,” etc.
      He then proceeds to describe them:</p>

    <p>“(1). Armillary Zodiacal Sphere of 6 feet diameter. This sphere reposes on
      the heads of four dragons, the bodies of which after various convolutions
      come to rest upon the extremities of two brazen beams forming a cross,
      and thus bear the entire weight of the instrument. These dragons ... are
      represented according to the notion the Chinese form of them, enveloped in
      clouds, covered above the horns with long hair, with a tufted beard on the
      lower jaw, flaming eyes, long sharp teeth, the gaping throat ever vomiting
      a torrent of fire. Four lion-cubs of the same material bear the ends of the
      cross beams, and the heads of these are raised or depressed by means of
      attached screws, according to what is required. The circles are divided on
      both exterior and interior surface into 360 degrees; each degree into 60
      minutes by transverse lines, and the minutes into sections of 10 seconds
      each by the sight-edge<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> applied to them.”</p>

    <p>Of Verbiest’s other instruments we need give only the names: (2) Equinoxial
      Sphere, 6 feet diameter. (3) Azimuthal Horizon, same diam. (4) Great
      Quadrant, of 6 feet radius. (5) Sextant of about 8 feet radius. (6)
      Celestial Globe of 6 feet diameter.</p>

    <p>As Lecomte gives no details of the old instruments which he saw through a
      grating, and as the description of this zodiacal sphere (No. 1) corresponds
      in some of its main features with that represented in the photograph,
      I could not but recognize the <em>possibility</em> that this instrument of
      Verbiest’s had for some reason or other been removed from the Terrace, and
      that the photograph might therefore possibly <em>not</em> be a representation of
      one of the ancient instruments displaced by him.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

    <p>The question having been raised it was very desirable to settle it, and I
      applied to Mr. Wylie for information, as I had received the photographs
      from him, and knew that he had been Mr. Thomson’s companion and helper in
      the matter.</p>

    <p>“Let me assure you,” he writes (21st August, 1874), “the Jesuits had
      nothing to do with the manufacture of the so-called Mongol instruments; and
      whoever made them, they were certainly on the Peking Observatory before
      Loyola was born. They are not made for the astronomical system introduced
      by the Jesuits, but are altogether conformable to the system introduced
      by Kúblái’s astronomer Ko Show-king.... I will mention one thing which
      is quite decisive as to the Jesuits. <em>The circle is divided into 365¼
      degrees</em>, each degree into 100 minutes, and each minute into 100 seconds.
      The Jesuits always used the sexagesimal division. Lecomte speaks of the
      imperfection of the division on the Jesuit-made instruments; but <em>those on
      the Mongol instruments are immeasurably coarser</em>.</p>

    <p>“I understand it is not the ornamentation your friend objects to?<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
      If it is, I would observe that there is no evidence of progress in the
      decorative and ornamental arts during the Ming Dynasty; and even in the
      Jesuit instruments that part of the work is purely Chinese, excepting in
      one instrument, which I am persuaded must have been made in Europe.</p>

    <p>“I have a Chinese work called <cite>Luh-King-t’oo-Kaou</cite>, ‘Illustrations and
      Investigations of the Six Classics.’ This was written in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1131–1162,
      and revised and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>printed in 1165–1174. It contains a representation of
      an armillary sphere, which appears to me to be much the same as the
      sphere in question. There is a solid horizon fixed to a graduated outer
      circle. Inside the latter is a meridian circle, at right angles to which
      is a graduated colure; then the equator, apparently a double ring, and
      the ecliptic; also two diametric bars. The cut is rudely executed, but
      it certainly shows that some one imagined something more perfect. The
      instrument stands on a cross frame, with 4 dragon supporters and a prop in
      the centre.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

    <p>“It should be remembered that under the Mongol Dynasty the Chinese had
      much intercourse with Central Asia; and among others Yelewchootsae, as
      confidential minister and astronomer, followed Chinghiz in his Western
      campaign, held intercourse with the astronomers of Samarkand, and on his
      return laid some astronomical inventions before the Emperor.</p>

    <p>“I append a notice of the Observatory taken from a popular description of
      Peking, by which it will be seen that the construction of these instruments
      is attributed to Ko Show-king, one of the most renowned astronomers of
      China. He was the chief astronomer under Kúblái Kaan” [to whom he was
      presented in 1262; he was born in 1231.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>“It must be remembered that there was a special vitality among the Chinese
      under the Yuen with regard to the arts and sciences, and the Emperor had
      the choice of artizans and men of science from all countries. From the age
      of the Yuen till the arrival of the Jesuits, we hear nothing of any new
      instruments having been made; and it is well known that astronomy was never
      in a lower condition than under the Ming.”<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

    <p>Mr. Wylie then draws attention to the account given by Trigault of the
      instruments that Matteo Ricci saw at Nanking, when he went (in the year
      1599) to pay a visit to some of the <em>literati</em> of that city. He transcribes
      the account from the French <cite>Hist. de l’Expédition Chrestienne en la
      Chine</cite>, 1618. But as I have the Latin, which is the original and is more
      lucid, by me, I will translate from that.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

    <p>“Not only at Peking, but in this capital also (Nanking) there is a College
      of Chinese Mathematicians, and this one certainly is more distinguished by
      the vastness of its buildings than by the skill of its professors. They
      have little talent and less learning, and do nothing beyond the preparation
      of the almanacs on the rules of calculation made by the ancients; and when
      it chances that events do not agree with their calculation they assert that
      what they had calculated was the regular course of things, but that the
      aberrant conduct of the stars was a prognostic from heaven of something
      going to happen on the earth. This something they make out according to
      their fancy, and so spread a veil over their own blunders. These gentlemen
      did not much trust Father Matteo, fearing, no doubt, lest he should put
      them to shame; but when at last they were freed from this apprehension they
      came and amicably visited the Father in hope of learning something from
      him. And when he went to return their visit he saw something that really
      was new and beyond his expectation.</p>

    <p>“There is a high hill at one side of the city, but still within the walls.
      On the top of the hill there is an ample terrace, capitally adapted for
      astronomical observation, and surrounded by magnificent buildings which
      form the residence of the Professors.... On this terrace are to be seen
      astronomical instruments of cast-metal, well worthy of inspection whether
      for size or for beauty; <em>and we certainly have never seen or read of
      anything in Europe like them</em>. For nearly 250 years they have stood thus
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>exposed to the rain, the snow, and all other atmospheric inclemencies, and
      yet they have lost absolutely nothing of their original lustre. And lest I
      should be accused of raising expectations which I do not justify, I will do
      my best in a digression, probably not unwelcome, to bring them before the
      eyes of my readers.</p>

    <p>“The larger of these instruments were four in number. First we inspected
      a great globe [A], graduated with meridians and parallels; we estimated
      that three men would hardly be able to embrace its girth.... A second
      instrument was a great sphere [B], not less in diameter than that measure
      of the outstretched arms which is commonly called a geometric pace. It
      had a horizon and poles; instead of circles it was provided with certain
      double hoops (<em>armillæ</em>), the void space between the pair serving the
      purpose of the circles of our spheres. All these were divided into 365
      degrees and some odd minutes. There was no globe to represent the earth in
      the centre, but there was a certain tube, bored like a gun-barrel, which
      could readily be turned about and fixed to any azimuth or any altitude so
      as to observe any particular star through the tube, just as we do with
      our vane-sights;<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>—not at all a despicable device! The third machine was
      a gnomon [C], the height of which was twice the diameter of the former
      instrument, erected on a very large and long slab of marble, on the
      northern side of the terrace. The stone slab had a channel cut round the
      margin, to be filled with water in order to determine whether the slab was
      level or not, and the style was set vertical as in hour-dials.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> We may
      suppose this gnomon to have been erected that by its aid the shadow at the
      solstices and equinoxes might be precisely noted, for in that view both
      the slab and the style were graduated. The fourth and last instrument, and
      the largest of all, was one consisting as it were of three or four huge
      astrolabes in juxtaposition [D]; each of them having a diameter of such a
      geometrical pace as I have specified. The fiducial line, or <em>Alhidada</em>,
      as it is called, was not lacking, nor yet the <em>Dioptra</em>.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Of these
      astrolabes, one having a tilted position in the direction of the south,
      represented the equator; a second, which stood crosswise on the first, in
      a north and south plane, the Father took for a meridian; but it could be
      turned round on its axis; a third stood in the meridian plane with its axis
      perpendicular, and seemed to stand for a vertical circle; but this also
      could be turned round so as to show any vertical whatever. Moreover all
      these were graduated, and the degrees marked by prominent studs of iron,
      so that in the night the graduation could be read by the touch without a
      light. All this compound astrolabe instrument was erected on a level marble
      platform with channels round it for levelling. On each of these instruments
      explanations of everything were given in Chinese characters; and there were
      also engraved the 24 zodiacal constellations which answer to our 12 signs,
      2 to each.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> There was, however, one error common to all the instruments,
      viz. that, in all, the elevation of the Pole was assumed to be 36°. Now
      there can be no question about the fact that the city of Nanking lies in
      lat. 32¼°; whence it would seem probable that these instruments were made
      for another locality, and had been erected at Nanking, without reference to
      its position, by some one ill versed in mathematical science.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

    <p>“Some years afterwards Father Matteo saw similar instruments at Peking, or
      rather the same instruments, so exactly alike were they, insomuch that they
      had unquestionably been made by the same artist. And indeed it is known
      that they were cast at the period when the Tartars were dominant in China;
      and we may without rashness conjecture that they were the work of some
      foreigner acquainted with our studies. But it is time to have done with
      these instruments.”—(<cite>Lib.</cite> IV. <cite>cap.</cite> 5.)</p>

    <p>In this interesting description it will be seen that the Armillary Sphere
      [B] agrees entirely with that represented in illustration facing <a href="#i450">p. 450</a>.
      And the second of his photographs in my possession, but not, I believe,
      yet published, answers <em>perfectly</em> to the curious description of the 4th
      instrument [D]. Indeed, I should scarcely have been able to translate
      that description intelligibly but for the aid of the photograph before
      me. It shows the three <em>astrolabes</em> or graduated circles with travelling
      indexes arranged exactly as described, and pivoted on a complex frame
      of bronze; (1) circle in the plane of the equator for measuring right
      ascensions; (2) circle with its axis vertical to the plane of the last,
      for measuring declinations: (3) circle with vertical axis, for zenith
      distances? The Gnomon [A] was seen by Mr. Wylie in one of the lower rooms
      of the Observatory (see below). Of the Globe we do not now hear; and that
      mentioned by Lecomte among the ancient instruments was inferior to what
      Ricci describes at Peking.</p>

    <p>I now transcribe Mr. Wylie’s translation of an extract from a Popular
      Description of Peking:</p>

    <p>“The observatory is on an elevated stage on the city wall, in the
      south-east corner of the (Tartar) city, and was built in the year (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span>
      1279). In the centre was the <em>Tze-wei</em><a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Palace, inside of which were a
      pair of scrolls, and a cross inscription, by the imperial hand. Formerly
      it contained the <em>Hwan-t’ien-e</em> [B] ‘Armillary Sphere’; the <em>Keen-e</em>
      [D?] ‘Transit Instrument’ (?); the <em>Tung-kew</em> [A] ‘Brass Globe’; and the
      <em>Leang-t’ien-ch’ih</em>, ‘Sector,’ which were constructed by Ko Show-king under
      the Yuen Dynasty.</p>

    <p>“In (1673) the old instruments having stood the wear of long past years,
      had become almost useless, and six new instruments were made by imperial
      authority. These were the <em>T’ien-t’ee</em> ‘Celestial Globe’ (6); <em>Chih-taoue</em>
      ‘Equinoctial Sphere’ (2); <em>Hwang-taoue</em> ‘Zodiacal Sphere’ (1); <em>Te-p’ing
      kinge</em> ‘Azimuthal Horizon’ (3); <em>Te-p’ing weie</em> ‘Altitude Instrument’
      (4); <em>Ke-yene</em> ‘Sextant’ (5). These were placed in the Observatory, and
      to the present day are respectfully used. The old instruments were at the
      same time removed, and deposited at the foot of the stage. In (1715) the
      <em>Te-ping King-wei-e</em> ‘Azimuth and Altitude Instrument’ was made;<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and in
      1744 the <em>Ke-hang-foo-chin-e</em> (literally ‘Sphere and Tube instrument for
      sweeping the heavens’). All these were placed on the Observatory stage.</p>

    <p>“There is a wind-index-pole called the ‘Fair-wind-pennon,’ on which is
      an iron disk marked out in 28 points, corresponding in number to the 28
      constellations.”<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

    <p>✛ Mr. Wylie justly observes that the evidence is all in accord, and it
      leaves, I think, no reasonable room for doubt that the instruments now in
      the Observatory <span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>garden at Peking are those which were cast aside by Father
      Verbiest<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> in 1673 (or 1668); which Father Ricci saw at Peking at the
      beginning of the century, and of which he has described the duplicates at
      Nanking; and which had come down from the time of the Mongols, or, more
      precisely, of Kúblái Khan.</p>

    <p>Ricci speaks of their age as nearly 250 years in 1599; Verbiest as nearly
      300 years in 1668. But these estimates evidently point to the <em>termination</em>
      of the Mongol Dynasty (1368), to which the Chinese would naturally refer
      their oral chronology. We have seen that Kúblái’s reign was the era of
      flourishing astronomy, and that the instruments are referred to his
      astronomer Ko Shéu-king; nor does there seem any ground for questioning
      this. In fact, it being once established that the instruments existed when
      the Jesuits entered China, all the objections fall to the ground.</p>

    <p>We may observe that the <em>number</em> of the ancient instruments mentioned in the
      popular Chinese account agrees with the number of important instruments
      described by Ricci, and the titles of three at least out of the four seem
      to indicate the same instruments. The catalogue of the new instruments
      of 1673 (or 1668) given in the native work also agrees <em>exactly</em> with
      that given by Lecomte.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> And in reference to my question as to the
      <em>possibility</em> that one of Verbiest’s instruments might have been removed
      from the terrace to the garden, it is now hardly worth while to repeat Mr.
      Wylie’s assurance that there is no ground whatever for such a supposition.
      The instruments represented by Lecomte are all still on the terrace, only
      their positions have been somewhat altered to make room for the two added
      in last century.</p>

    <p>Probably, says Mr. Wylie, more might have been added from Chinese works,
      especially the biography of Ko Shéu-king. But my kind correspondent was
      unable to travel beyond the books on his own shelves. Nor was it needful.</p>

    <p>It will have been seen that, beautiful as the art and casting of these
      instruments is, it would be a mistake to suppose that they are entitled to
      equally high rank in scientific accuracy. Mr. Wylie mentioned the question
      that had been started to Freiherr von Gumpach, who was for some years
      Professor of Astronomy in the Peking College. Whilst entirely rejecting
      the doubts that had been raised as to the age of the Mongol instruments,
      he said that he had seen those of Tycho Brahe, and the former are quite
      unworthy to be compared with Tycho’s in scientific accuracy.</p>

    <p>The doubts expressed have been useful in drawing attention to these
      remarkable reliques of the era of Kúblái’s reign, and of Marco Polo’s
      residence in Cathay, though I fear they are answerable for having added
      some pages to a work that required no enlargement!</p>

    <p>[Mr. Wylie sent a most valuable paper on <cite>The Mongol Astronomical
      Instruments at Peking</cite> to the Congress of Orientalists held at St.
      Petersburg, which was reprinted at Shanghai in 1897 in <cite>Chinese
      Researches</cite>. Some of the astronomical instruments have been removed to
      Potsdam by the Germans since the siege of the foreign Legations at Peking
      in 1900.—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p>On these auguries, and on diviners and fortune-tellers, see <cite>Semedo</cite>, p.
      118 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Kidd</cite>, p. 313 (also for preceding references, <cite>Mid. Kingdom</cite>,
      II. 152; <cite>Gaubil</cite>, 136).</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXIII22" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIII22" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 2.</a>— ✛ The real cycle of the Mongols, which was also that of the
      Chinese, runs: 1. Rat; 2. Ox; 3. Tiger; 4. Hare; 5. Dragon; 6. Serpent;
      7. Horse; 8. Sheep; 9. Ape; 10. Cock; 11. Dog; 12. Swine. But as such a
      cycle [12 earthly branches, <em>Ti-chih</em>] is too short to avoid confusion,
      it is combined with a co-efficient cycle of <em>ten</em> epithets [celestial
      Stems, <em>T’ien-kan</em>] in such wise as to produce a 60-year cycle of compound
      names before the same shall recur. These co-efficient epithets are found
      in four different forms: (1) From the Elements: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal,
      Water, attaching to each a masculine and feminine attribute so as to make
      ten epithets. (2) From the Colours: Blue, Red, Yellow, White, Black,
      similarly treated. (3) By <span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>terms without meaning in Mongol, directly adopted
      or imitated from the Chinese, <em>Ga</em>, Yi, Bing, Ting, etc. (4) By the five
      Cardinal Points: East, South, Middle, West, North. Thus 1864 was the first
      year of a 60-year cycle:—</p>

    <table summary="60-year cycle">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1864 = (Masc.) <em>Wood-Rat</em> Year</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1865 = (Fem.) <em>Wood-Ox</em> Year</td>
          <td>= (Fem.) <em>Blue-Ox</em> Year.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1866 = (Masc.) <em>Fire-Tiger</em> Year</td>
          <td>= (Masc.) <em>Red-Tiger</em> Year.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1867 = (Fem.) <em>Fire-Hare</em> Year</td>
          <td>= (Fem.) <em>Red-Hare</em> Year.</td>

          <td>1923 = (Fem.) <em>Water-Swine</em> Year</td>
          <td>= (Fem.) <em>Black-Swine</em> Year.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p class="noindent">And then a new cycle commences just as before.</p>

    <p>This Calendar was carried by the Mongols into all their dominions, and it
      would appear to have long survived them in Persia. Thus a document issued
      in favour of Sir John Chardin by the <em>Shaikh-ul-Islám</em> of Ispahan, bears
      the strange date for a Mahomedan luminary of “The year of the Swine.” The
      Hindus also had a 60-year cycle, but with them each year had an independent name.</p>

    <p>The Mongols borrowed their system from the Chinese, who attribute its
      invention to the Emperor Hwang-ti, and its initiation to the 61st year of
      his reign, corresponding to <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 2637. [“It was Ta-nao, Minister to the
      Emperor Hwang-ti, who, by command of his Sovereign, devised the sexagenary
      cycle. Hwang-ti began to reign 2697 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, and the 61st year of his reign
      was taken for the first cyclical sign.” <cite>P. Hoang</cite>, <cite>Chinese Calendar</cite>,
      p. 11.—H.&nbsp;C.] The characters representing what we have called the ten
      co-efficient epithets are called by the Chinese the “Heavenly Stems”; those
      equivalent to the twelve animal symbols are the “Earthly Branches,” and
      they are applied in their combinations not to years only, but to cycles of
      months, days, and hours, such hours being equal to two of ours. Thus every
      year, month, day, and hour will have two appropriate characters, and the
      four pairs belonging to the time of any man’s birth constitute what the
      Chinese call the “Eight Characters” of his age, to which constant reference
      is made in some of their systems of fortune-telling, and in the selection
      of propitious days for the transaction of business. To this system the
      text alludes. A curious account of the principles of prognostication on
      such a basis will be found in <cite>Doolittle’s Social Life of the Chinese</cite> (p.
      579 <i>seqq.</i>; on the Calendar, see Schmidt’s Preface to <cite>S. Setzen</cite>; <cite>Pallas,

    <p>[“Kubilai Khan established in Peking two astronomical boards and two
      observatories. One of them was a Chinese Observatory (<em>sze t’ien t’ai</em>),
      the other a Mohammedan Observatory (<em>hui hui sze t’ien t’ai</em>), each with
      its particular astronomical and chronological systems, its particular
      astrology and instruments. The first astronomical and calendar system
      was compiled for the Mongols by Ye-liu Ch’u-ts’ai, who was in Chingis
      Khan’s service, not only as a high counsellor, but also as an astronomer
      and astrologer. After having been convinced of the obsoleteness and
      incorrectness of the astronomical calculations in the <em>Ta ming li</em> (the
      name of the calendar system of the Kin Dynasty), he thought out at the
      time he was at Samarcand a new system, valid not only for China, but also
      for the countries conquered by the Mongols in Western Asia, and named
      it in memory of Chingis Khan’s expedition <em>Si ching keng wu yüan li</em>,
      <i>i.e.</i> ‘Astronomical Calendar beginning with the year <em>Keng wu</em>, compiled
      during the war in the west.’ Keng-wu was the year 1210 of our era. Ye-liu
      Ch’u-ts’ai chose this year, and the moment of the winter solstice, for
      the beginning of his period; because, according to his calculations, it
      coincided with the beginning of a new astronomical or planetary period.
      He took also into consideration, that since the year 1211 Chingis Khan’s
      glory had spread over the whole world. Ye-liu Ch’u-ts’ai’s calendar was not
      adopted in China, but the system of it is explained in the <em>Yuen-shi</em>, in
      the section on Astronomy and the Calendar.</p>

    <p>“In the year 1267, the Mohammedans presented to Kubilai their astronomical
      calendar (<em>wan nien li</em>, <i>i.e.</i>), the calendar of ten thousand years. By
      taking this denomination in its literal sense, we may conclude that the
      Mahommedans brought <span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>to China the ancient Persian system, founded on the
      period of 10,000 years. The compilers of the <cite>Yuen-shi</cite> seem not to have
      had access to documents relating to this system, for they give no details
      about it. Finally by order of Kubilai the astronomers <em>Hui-Heng</em> and <em>Ko
      Show-King</em> composed a new calculation under the name of <em>Shou-shi-li</em>,
      which came into use from the year 1280. It is thoroughly explained in
      the <cite>Yuen-shi</cite>. Notwithstanding the fame this system generally enjoyed,
      its blemishes came soon to light. In the sixth month of 1302 an eclipse
      of the sun happened, and the calculation of the astronomer proved to be
      erroneous (it seems the calculation had anticipated the real time). The
      astronomers of the Ming Dynasty explained the errors in the <cite>Shou-shi-li</cite>
      by the circumstance, that in that calculation the period for one degree of
      precession of the equinox was taken too long (eighty-one years). But they
      were themselves hardly able to overcome these difficulties.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>,
      pp. 51–53.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

      <em>dioptra</em>, <em>pinnules</em>, or sight-vanes. The word is found in some
      older English Dictionaries, and in France and Italy is still applied
      to the traversing index of a plane table or of a sextant. Littré
      derives it from (Ar.) <em>’adád</em>, enumeration; but it is really from
      a quite different word, <em>al-iḍádat</em> عضادة “a door-post,” which
      is found in this sense in an Arabic treatise on the Astrolabe. (See

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_493" href="#FNanchor_493" class="label">[11]</a> This is an error of Ricci’s, as Mr. Wylie observes, or of
      his reporter.

      <p>The Chinese divide their year into 24 portions of 15 days each.
        Of these 24 divisions twelve called <em>Kung</em> mark the twelve places
        in which the sun and moon come into conjunction, and are thus in
        some degree analogous to our 12 signs of the Zodiac. The names of
        these <em>Kung</em> are entirely different from those of our sign, though
        since the 17th century the Western Zodiac, with paraphrased names,
        has been introduced in some of their books. But besides that, they
        divide the heavens into 28 stellar spaces. The correspondence of
        this division to the Hindu system of the 28 Lunar Mansions, called
        <em>Nakshatras</em>, has given rise to much discussion. The Chinese <em>sieu</em>
        or stellar spaces are excessively unequal, varying from 24° in
        equatorial extent down to 24′. (<cite>Williams</cite>, op. cit.) [See <cite>P.
        Hoang</cite>, <i>supra</i> p. 449.]</p>
    </div>

    <div class="footnote">
      <a id="Footnote_494" href="#FNanchor_494" class="label">[12]</a> Mr. Wylie is inclined to distrust the accuracy of this
      remark, as the only city nearly on the 36th parallel is P’ing-yang fu.

      <p>But we have noted in regard to this (Polo’s Pianfu, vol. ii. p. 17)
        that a college for the education of Mongol youth was instituted
        here, by the great minister Yeliu Chutsai, whose devotion to
        astronomy Mr. Wylie has noticed above. In fact, two colleges were
        established by him, one at Yenking, <i>i.e.</i> Peking, the other at
        P’ing-yang; and astronomy is specified as one of the studies to be
        pursued at these. (See <cite>D’Ohsson</cite>, II. 71–72, quoting <cite>De Mailla</cite>.)
        It seems highly probable that the two sets of instruments were
        originally intended for these two institutions, and that one set was
        carried to Nanking, when the Ming set their capital there in 1368.</p>

      <em>Yuen</em> or enclosures, of which the field of circumpolar stars (or

  <h4 id="CHAPTER_XXXIV2"><span class="gespertt1">CHAPTER XXXIV</span>.</h4>

  <div class="subh4">Concerning the Religion of the Cathayans;<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV21" href="#Note_XXXIV21" class="fnanchor">{1}</a> their views as to the
    Soul; and their Customs.</div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> we have said before, these people are Idolaters, and as regards their
    gods, each has a tablet fixed high up on the wall of his chamber, on which
    is inscribed a name which represents the Most High and Heavenly God; and
    before this they pay daily worship, offering incense from a thurible,
    raising their hands aloft, and gnashing their teeth<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV22" href="#Note_XXXIV22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> three times,
    praying Him to grant them health of mind and body; but of Him they ask
    nought else. And below on the ground there is a figure which they call
    <em>Natigai</em>, which is the god of things terrestrial. To him they give a
    wife and children, and they worship him in the same manner, with incense,
    and gnashing of teeth,<a href="#Note_XXXIV22" class="fnanchor">{2}</a> and lifting up of hands; and of him they
    ask seasonable weather, and the fruits of the earth, children, and so
    forth.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV23" href="#Note_XXXIV23" class="fnanchor">{3}</a></p>

  <p>Their view of the immortality of the soul is after this fashion. They
    believe that as soon as a man dies, his soul enters into another body,
    going from a good to a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>better, or from a bad to a worse, according as he
    hath conducted himself well or ill. That is to say, a poor man, if he have
    passed through life good and sober, shall be born again of a gentlewoman,
    and shall be a gentleman; and on a second occasion shall be born of a
    princess and shall be a prince, and so on, always rising, till he be
    absorbed into the Deity. But if he have borne himself ill, he who was the
    son of a gentleman shall be reborn as the son of a boor, and from a boor
    shall become a dog, always going down lower and lower.</p>

  <p>The people have an ornate style of speech; they salute each other with
    a cheerful countenance, and with great politeness; they behave like
    gentlemen, and eat with great propriety.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV24" href="#Note_XXXIV24" class="fnanchor">{4}</a> They show great respect
    to their parents; and should there be any son who offends his parents, or
    fails to minister to their necessities, there is a public office which has
    no other charge but that of punishing unnatural children, who are proved to
    have acted with ingratitude towards their parents.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV25" href="#Note_XXXIV25" class="fnanchor">{5}</a></p>

  <p>Criminals of sundry kinds who have been imprisoned, are released at a time
    fixed by the Great Kaan (which occurs every three years), but on leaving
    prison they are branded on one cheek that they may be recognized.</p>

  <p>The Great Kaan hath prohibited all gambling and sharping, things more
    prevalent there than in any other part of the world. In doing this, he
    said: “I have conquered you by force of arms, and all that you have is
    mine; if, therefore, you gamble away your property, it is in fact my
    property that you are gambling away.” Not that he took anything from them
    however.</p>

  <p>I must not omit to tell you of the orderly way in which the Kaan’s Barons
    and others conduct themselves in coming to his presence. In the first
    place, within a half mile of the place where he is, out of reverence for
    his exalted majesty, everybody preserves a mien of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>greatest meekness
    and quiet, so that no noise of shrill voices or loud talk shall be heard.
    And every one of the chiefs and nobles carries always with him a handsome
    little vessel to spit in whilst he remain in the Hall of Audience—for no
    one dares spit on the floor of the hall,—and when he hath spitten he covers
    it up and puts it aside.<a id="NoteAnchor_XXXIV26" href="#Note_XXXIV26" class="fnanchor">{6}</a> So also they all have certain handsome
    buskins of white leather, which they carry with them, and, when summoned
    by the sovereign, on arriving at the entrance to the hall, they put on
    these white buskins, and give their others in charge to the servants, in
    order that they may not foul the fine carpets of silk and gold and divers colours.]</p>

      interpolated, seeing that it introduces again as a <em>Chinese</em> divinity the
      rude object of primitive Tartar worship, of which we have already heard in
      <a href="#CHAPTER_LIII1">Bk. I. ch. liii.</a> And regarding the former part of the passage, one cannot
      but have some doubt whether what was taken for the symbol of the Most
      High was not the ancestral tablet, which is usually placed in one of the
      inner rooms of the house, and before which worship is performed at fixed
      times, and according to certain established forms. Something, too, may
      have been known of the Emperor’s worship of Heaven at the great circular
      temple at Peking, called <em>T’ien-t’ân</em>, or Altar of Heaven (see <a href="#Page_459">p. 459</a>),
      where incensed offerings are made before a tablet, on which is inscribed
      the name Yuh-Hwang Shang-ti, which some interpret as “The Supreme Ruler of
      the Imperial Heavens,” and regard as the nearest approach to pure Theism
      of which there is any indication in Chinese worship (See <cite>Doolittle</cite>, pp.
      170, 625; and <cite>Lockhart</cite> in <cite>J. R. G. S.</cite>, xxxvi. 142). This worship is
      mentioned by the Mahomedan narrator of Shah Rukh’s embassy (1421): “Every
      year there are some days on which the Emperor eats no animal food.... He
      spends his time in an apartment which contains no idol, and says that he is
      worshipping the God of Heaven.”<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (<cite>Ind. Antiquary</cite>, II. 81.)</p>

    <p>The charge of irreligion against the Chinese is an old one, and is made
      by Hayton in nearly the same terms as it often is by modern missionaries:
      “And though these people have the acutest intelligence in all matters
      wherein material things are concerned, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>yet you shall never find among them
      any knowledge or perception of spiritual things.” Yet it is a mistake
      to suppose that this insensibility has been so universal as it is often
      represented. To say nothing of the considerable numbers who have adhered
      faithfully to the Roman Catholic Church, the large number of Mahomedans
      in China, of whom many must have been proselytes, indicates an interest
      in religion; and that Buddhism itself was in China once a spiritual power
      of no small energy will, I think, be plain to any one who reads the very
      interesting extracts in Schott’s essay on Buddhism in Upper Asia and China.
      (<cite>Berlin Acad. of Sciences</cite>, 1846.) These seem to be so little known that I
      will translate two or three of them. “In the years <em>Yuan-yeu</em> of the Sung
      (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1086–1093), a pious matron with her two servants lived entirely to
      the Land of Enlightenment. One of the maids said one day to her companion:
      ‘To-night I shall pass over to the Realm of Amita.’ The same night a
      balsamic odour filled the house, and the maid died without any preceding
      illness. On the following day the surviving maid said to the lady:
      ‘Yesterday my deceased companion appeared to me in a dream, and said to
      me: “Thanks to the persevering exhortations of our mistress, I am become a
      partaker of Paradise, and my blessedness is past all expression in words.”’
      The matron replied: ‘If she will appear to me also then I will believe
      what you say.’ Next night the deceased really appeared to her, and saluted
      her with respect. The lady asked: ‘May I, for once, visit the Land of
      Enlightenment?’ ‘Yea,’ answered the Blessed Soul, ‘thou hast but to follow
      thy handmaiden.’ The lady followed her (in her dream), and soon perceived
      a lake of immeasurable expanse, overspread with innumerable red and white
      lotus flowers, of various sizes, some blooming, some fading. She asked
      what those flowers might signify? The maiden replied: ‘These are all human
      beings on the earth whose thoughts are turned to the Land of Enlightenment.
      The very first longing after the Paradise of Amita produces a flower in
      the Celestial Lake, and this becomes daily larger and more glorious, as
      the self-improvement of the person whom it represents advances; in the
      contrary case, it loses in glory and fades away.’<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The matron desired to
      know the name of an enlightened one who reposed on one of the flowers, clad
      in a waving and wondrously glistening raiment. Her whilom maiden answered:
      ‘That is Yangkie.’ Then asked she the name of another, and was answered:
      ‘That is Mahu.’ The lady then said: ‘At what place shall I hereafter come
      into existence?’ Then the Blessed Soul led her a space further, and showed
      her a hill that gleamed with gold and azure. ‘Here,’ said she, ‘is your
      future abode. You will belong to the first order of the blessed.’ When
      the matron awoke she sent to enquire for Yangkie and Mahu. The first was
      already departed; the other still alive and well. And thus the lady learned
      that the soul of one who advances in holiness and never turns back, may be
      already a dweller in the Land of Enlightenment, even though the body still
      sojourn in this transitory world” (pp. 55–56).</p>

      was at last struck with an apoplexy. The sorrows in store for his sin-laden
      soul pained me to the heart; I visited him, and exhorted him to call on the
      Amita; but he obstinately refused, and spoke only of indifferent matters.
      His illness clouded his understanding; in consequence of his misdeeds he
      had become hardened. What was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>before such a man when once his eyes were
      closed? Wherefore let men be converted while there is yet time! In this
      life the night followeth the day, and the winter followeth the summer;
      that, all men are aware of. But that life is followed by death, no man will
      consider. Oh, what blindness and obduracy is this!” (p. 93).</p>

    <p>Again: “Hoang-ta-tie, of T’ancheu (Changshu-fu in Honan), who lived under
      the Sung, followed the craft of a blacksmith. Whenever he was at his work
      he used to call without intermission on the name of Amita Buddha. One day
      he handed to his neighbours the following verses of his own composing to be
      spread about:—</p>

    <div class="center-container">
      <div class="poetry">
        <div class="stanza">
          <div class="i0">‘Ding dong! The hammer-strokes fall long and fast,</div>
          <div class="i1">Until the Iron turns to steel at last!</div>
          <div class="i1">Now shall the long long Day of Rest begin,</div>
          <div class="i1">The Land of Bliss Eternal calls me in.’</div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="noindent">Thereupon he died. But his verses spread all over Honan, and many learned
      to call upon Buddha” (103).</p>

    <p>Once more: “In my own town there lived a physician by name Chang-yan-ming.
      He was a man who never took payment for his treatment from any one in poor
      or indifferent circumstances; nay, he would often make presents to such
      persons of money or corn to lighten their lot. If a rich man would have his
      advice and paid him a fee, he never looked to see whether it were much or
      little. If a patient lay so dangerously ill that Yanming despaired of his
      recovery, he would still give him good medicine to comfort his heart, but
      never took payment for it. I knew this man for many a year, and I never
      heard the word <em>Money</em> pass his lips! One day a fire broke out in the town,
      and laid the whole of the houses in ashes; only that of the physician was
      spared. His sons and grandsons reached high dignities” (p. 110).</p>

    <p>Of such as this physician the apostle said: “Of a truth I perceive that God
      is no respecter of persons: But in every nation he that feareth Him, and
      worketh righteousness, is accepted with Him.”</p>

    <p>[“By the ‘Most High and Heavenly God,’ worshipped by the Chinese, as Marco
      Polo reports, evidently the Chinese <em>T’ien</em>, ‘Heaven’ is meant, <em>Lao t’ien
      ye</em> in the common language. Regarding ‘the God of things terrestrial,’
      whose figure the Chinese, according to M. Polo, ‘placed below on the
      ground,’ there can also be no doubt that he understands the <em>T’u-ti</em>, the
      local ‘Lar’ of the Chinese, to which they present sacrifices on the floor,
      near the wall under the table.</p>

    <p>“M. Polo reports, that the Chinese worship their God offering incense,
      raising their hands aloft, and gnashing their teeth. Of course he means
      that they placed the hands together, or held kindled joss-stick bundles
      in their hands, according to the Chinese custom. The statement of M. Polo
      <i lang="it">sbattendo i denti</i> is very remarkable. It seems to me, that very few of
      the Chinese are aware of the fact, that this custom still exists among
      the Taouists. In the rituals of the Taouists the <em>K’ow-ch’i</em> (<em>K’ow</em> =
      ‘to knock against,’<em>ch’i</em> = ‘teeth’) is prescribed as a comminatory and
      propitiatory act. It is effected by the four upper and lower foreteeth.
      The Taouists are obliged before the service begins to perform a certain
      number of <em>K’ow-ch’i</em>, turning their heads alternately to the left and
      to the right, in order to drive away mundane thoughts and aggressions of
      bad spirits. The <em>K’ow-ch’i</em> repeated three times is called <em>ming fa ku</em>
      in Chinese, <i>i.e.</i> ‘to beat the spiritual drum.’ The ritual says, that it is
      heard by the Most High Ruler, who is moved by it to grace.</p>

    <p>“M. Polo observed this custom among the lay heathen. Indeed, it appears
      from a small treatise, written in China more than a hundred years before
      M. Polo, that at the time the Chinese author wrote, all devout men,
      entering a temple, used to perform the <em>K’ow-ch’i</em>, and considered it an
      expression of veneration and devotion to the idols. Thus this custom had
      been preserved to the time of M. Polo, who did not fail to mention this
      strange peculiarity in the exterior observances of the Chinese. As regards
      the present time it seems to me, that this custom is not known among the
      people, and even with respect to the Taouists it is only performed on
      certain occasions, and not in all Taouist temples.” (<cite>Palladius</cite>, pp.
      53–54.)—H.&nbsp;C.]</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXIV24" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIV24" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 4.</a>—“True politeness cannot of course be taught by rules merely, but a
      great degree of urbanity and kindness is everywhere shown, whether owing
      to the naturally placable disposition of the people, or to the effects of
      their early instruction in the forms of politeness.” (<cite>Mid. Kingdom</cite>, II.
      68.) As regards the “ornate style of speech,” a well-bred Chinaman never
      says <em>I</em> or <em>You</em>, but for the former “the little person,” “the disciple,”
      “the inferior,” and so on; and for the latter, “the learned man,” “the
      master,” or even “the emperor.” These phrases, however, are not confined to
      China, most of them having exact parallels in Hindustani courtesy. On this
      subject and the courteous disposition of the Chinese, see <cite>Fontaney</cite>, in
      <cite>Lett. Edif.</cite> VII. 287 <i>seqq.</i>; also XI. 287 <i>seqq.</i>; <cite>Semedo</cite>, 36; <cite>Lecomte</cite>,
      II. 48 <i>seqq.</i> There are, however, strong differences of opinion expressed on
      this subject; there is, apparently, much more genuine courtesy in the north
      than in the south.</p>

    <p><a id="Note_XXXIV25" href="#NoteAnchor_XXXIV25" class="label"><span class="smcap">Note</span> 5.</a>—“Filial piety is the fundamental principle of the Chinese polity.”
      (<cite>Amiot</cite>, V. 129.) “In cases of extreme unfilial conduct, parents sometimes
      accuse their children before the magistrate, and demand his official aid
      in controlling or punishing them; but such instances are comparatively
      rare.... If the parent require his son to be publicly whipped by the
      command of the magistrate, the latter is obliged to order the infliction
      of the whipping.... If after punishment the son remain undutiful and
      disobedient, and his parents demand it at the hands of the magistrate, the
      latter must, with the consent of the maternal uncles of the son, cause him
      to be taken out to the high wall in front of the yamun, and have him there
      publicly whipped to death.” (<cite>Doolittle</cite>, 102–103.)</p>

      from 1420–1430; but the <em>Institution</em> is very ancient, and I think
      there is evidence that such a structure existed under the Mongols,
      probably only <em>restored</em> by the Ming. [It was built during the 18th
      year of the reign of the third Ming Emperor Yung Loh (1403–1425);
      it was entirely restored during the 18th year of K’ien Lung; it was

      extraordinary productions (for extraordinary they were undoubtedly)
      professed to represent the “Spiritual Flowers” of such and such
      persons; and the explanation of this as presented in the catalogue
      was in substance exactly that given in the text. It is highly

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
